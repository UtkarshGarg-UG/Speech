Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~[inaudible]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~[inaudible].
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~A statement that was refuted by the governor of the state of Vermont, who was a supporter of hers, who said, yeah, in campaigns people tend to exaggerate.Here is the fact on guns. Let's talk about guns. That horrible, horrible Sandy Hook &mdash; what's the word we want to use, murder, assault, slaughter, unspeakable act.Back in 1988, I ran for the United States Congress one seat in the state of Vermont. I probably lost that election, which I lost by three points, because I was the only candidate running who said, you know what? We should ban assault weapons, not seen them sold or distributed in the United States of America.I've got a D-minus voting record from the NRA. [applause] And, in fact, because I come from a state which has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am the best qualified candidate to bring back together that consensus that is desperately needed in this country. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~According to "The New York Times." [applause] for President Obama, this was a pretty tough call, like a 51-49 call, do you overthrow Qadafi, who, of course, was a horrific dictator?"The New York Times" told us it was Secretary Clinton who led the effect for that regime change. And this is the same type of mentality that supported the war in Iraq. [applause] Look [applause] Qadafi, Saddam Hussein are brutal, brutal murdering thugs. No debate about that.But what we have got to do and what the president was saying is we didn't think thoroughly about what happens the day after you get rid of these dictators.Regime change often has unintended consequences in Iraq and in Libya right now, where ISIS has a very dangerous foothold. And I think if you studied the whole history of
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~All right, here is &mdash; here is a real difference. This is a difference between understanding that we have a crisis of historical consequence here, and incrementalism and those little steps are not enough. [applause] Not right now. Not on climate change. Now, the truth is, as secretary of state, Secretary Clinton actively supported fracking technology around the world. Second of all, right now, we have got to tell the fossil fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet. [applause] And that means &mdash; and I would ask you to respond. Are you in favor of a tax on carbon so that we can transit away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy at the level and speed we need to do? [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~All right, so
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~All right. Essentially what you described is my legislation, which includes [inaudible]  [applause] Now, we've got &mdash; here is the issue. Your answer has been the same year after year. In fact, the idea that I'm bringing forth, I have to admit it, you know, it wasn't my idea. It was Barack Obama's idea in 2008, the exact same idea. [applause] He called for lifting the cap, which is now higher &mdash; it's at 118 &mdash; and starting at 250 and going on up. If you do that, you're going to extend the life of Social Security for 58 years. You will significantly expand benefits by 1,300 bucks a year for seniors and disabled vets under $16,000 a year.What's wrong with that?Are you prepared to support it?
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~American involvement in regime change, you see that quite often.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~An interesting comment, but you didn't answer the question.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~And let's talk about judgment.And let us talk about the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country  [applause] I led the opposition to that war. Secretary Clinton voted for that. Well, let's talk about judgment. Let's talk about super PACs and 501(c)(4)s, money which is completely undisclosed.Where does the money come from?Do we really feel confident about a candidate saying that she's going to bring change in America when she is so dependent on big money interests?I don't think so. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~And suddenly
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~And we are not going to win the White House based on just long-term Democratic votes. We have got to reach out to independents and I think I am well qualified to do that.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Are you for a tax on carbon or not?
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Because I'm not sure that the government should say is you are too big to fail. You've got to be a certain size. And, then the banks themselves can figure out what they want to sell off. I don't know that it's appropriate that the Department of Treasury to be making those decisions. What we need is to make sure that they are safe. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Because it was a racist term, and everybody knew it was a racist term. [applause] Look, much of what Secretary Clinton said was right. We had a crime bill. I voted for it. It had the Violence Against Women Act in it. When as mayor of Burlington, we worked very hard to try to eliminate domestic violence. This took us a good step forward. We're talking about the weapon that killed the children in Sandy Hook. This banned assault weapons, not insignificant.But where we are today is we have a broken criminal justice system. We have more people in jail than any other country on Earth. And in my view, what we have got to do is rethink the system from the bottom on up. And that means, for a start &mdash; and we don't talk about this. The media doesn't talk about it &mdash; you got 51 percent of African-American kids today who graduated high school who are unemployed or underemployed. You know what I think? Maybe we invest in jobs and education for those kids, not jails and incarceration. [applause] And I'll tell you what else. And I'll tell you what else I think. And that is, we have got &mdash; and this is the difference between the secretary and myself as I understand it. We have got to have the guts to rethink the so-called war on drugs. Too many lives
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~campaign of challenging, if I hear you correctly, Madam Secretary, you are now coming out finally in favor of lifting the cap on taxable income [applause] and extending and expanding Social Security. If that is the case, welcome on board. I'm glad you're here. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Can I answer
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~can I have  [crosstalk]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~do I not?
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Excuse me, I think I'm responding now.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Excuse me.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~First of all, the word contempt is not right. There are some great businesses who treat their workers and the environment with respect. [applause] Verizon happens not to be one of them. [applause] And what we need to do is to tell this guy Immelt, who's the head of General Electric, he doesn't like me, well, that's fine. He has outsourced hundreds of thousands of decent-paying jobs throughout the world [applause] cut his workforce here substantially and in a given year, by the way, it turns out that both Verizon and General Electric, in a given year, pay nothing in federal income tax despite making billions in profits. [booing]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~First, Dana
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I'm going to respond
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I'm still
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I've got to admit
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I am in this race as a Democrat. I have raised millions of dollars for my colleagues in the United States Senate to help them get elected. I will do everything I can to open the Democratic party to the young people who are flocking into our political campaign. [cheering]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I am sure a lot of people are very surprised to learn that you supported raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I am very glad that [crosstalk]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I am very glad to [crosstalk]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I believe I was [crosstalk]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I don't think that anybody would suggest that Israel invites and welcomes missiles flying into their country. That is not the issue.And, you evaded the answer. You evaded the question. The question is not does Israel have a right to respond, nor does Israel have a right to go after terrorists and destroy terrorism. That's not the debate. Was their response disproportionate?I believe that it was, you have not answered that. [cheering]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I grew up in Brooklyn, New York [applause] the son of an immigrant who came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, never made a whole lot of money, but was a very proud American, because this country gave him and my mom the opportunity to send their kids to college.I believe that this country has enormous potential if we have the guts to take on the big money interests who dominate our economic and political life. And I disagree with Secretary Clinton in the belief that you can get money from Wall Street, that you can get money for a super PAC from powerful special interests, and then at the end of the day do what has to be done for the working families of this country. I just don't accept that.What I believe is that this country, if we stand together and not let the Trumps of the world divide us up, can guarantee health care to all people as a right, can have paid family and medical leave, can make public colleges and universities tuition-free, can lead the world in transforming our energy system and combatting climate change, can break up the large financial institutions, can demand that the wealthiest people in this country start paying their fair share of taxes.And we can do that when millions of people stand up, fight back, and create a government that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent. [applause] That is what the political revolution is about. That is what this campaign is about. And with your help, we're going to win here in New York. Thank you. Thank you. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I know what Secretary Clinton is saying.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I read Secretary Clinton's statement speech before AIPAC. I heard virtually no discussion at all about the needs of the Palestinian people. Almost none in that speech. [applause] So here is the issue: of course Israel has a right to defend itself, but long term there will never be peace in that region unless the United States plays a role, an even-handed role trying to bring people together and recognizing the serious problems that exist among the Palestinian people.That is what I believe the world wants to us do and that's the kind of leadership that we have got to exercise.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I think we're going to win this nomination to tell you the truth. [cheering]Look, let me acknowledge what is absolutely true. Secretary Clinton cleaned our clock in the Deep South. No question about it. We got murdered there. That is the most conservative part of this great country. That's the fact.But you know what? We're out of the Deep South now. And we're moving up. We got here. We're going to California. We got a number of large states there. And having won seven out of the last eight caucuses and primaries, having a level of excitement and energy among working people and low-income people doing better against Donald Trump and the other Republicans in poll after poll than Secretary Clinton is, yeah, I believe that we're going to win this nomination, and I believe we're going to obliterate Donald Trump or whoever the Republican candidate is. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I think we have got to be clear, not equivocate, $15 in minimum wage in 50 states in this country as soon as possible.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I will
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~If you listen, you know &mdash; two points. Number one, yes, 100-0 in the Senate voted for democracy in Libya and I would vote for that again. But that is very different from getting actively involved to overthrow and bring about regime change without fully understanding what the consequence of that regime change would be.Second of all, I know you keep referring to Barack Obama all night here, but you in Syria, you in Syria talked about a no-fly zone, which the president certainly does not support, nor do I support because, A, it will cost an enormous sum of money, second of all, it runs the risk of getting us sucked into perpetual warfare in that region.Thirdly, when we talk about Syria right now, no debate, like Gadhafi, like Saddam Hussein, Assad is another brutal murdering dictator, but right now our fight is to destroy ISIS first, and to get rid of Assad second.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Including a tax on carbon. Something I don't believe Secretary Clinton supports. [cheering and applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~It is one thing, as the Secretary indicated, to talk about workers. I'm sure I have contributions, you have contributions from workers in every industry in the country. But, as I understand it, 43 lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry maxed out, gave the maximum amount of money to Secretary Clinton's campaign. [applause] Now, that's not saying &mdash; and, then some people say, well, given the hundreds of millions of dollars she raises it's a small amount. That's true. But, that does not mean to say that the lobbyists thought she was a pretty good bet on this issue.Now, what I think is when we look at climate change now, we have got to realize that this is a global environmental crisis of unprecedented urgency. [cheering and applause]And, it is not good enough. You know, if we, God forbid, were attacked tomorrow the whole country would rise up and say we got an enemy out there and we got to do something about it. That was what 9/11 was about.We have an enemy out there, and that enemy is going to cause drought and floods and extreme weather disturbances. There's going to be international conflict. [applause] I am proud, Wolf, that I have introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Last year's.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Lead the world.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Let's talk about that. When you were Secretary of State, you also worked hard to expand fracking to countries all over the world. [cheering]The issue here &mdash; of course the agreement is a step forward, but you know agreements and I know agreements, there's a lot of paper there. We've got to get beyond paper right now.We have got to lead the world in transforming our energy system, not tomorrow, but yesterday. [applause] And, what that means, Wolf, it means having the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry. Now, I am on board legislation that says, you know what, we ain't going to excavate for fossil fuel on public land. That's not Secretary Clinton's position.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Let me interject here.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Let me just reiterate &mdash; just reiterate so there is no confusion, decades ago, before it was popular, in a rural state with no gun control, Bernie Sanders said, let's ban assault weapons, not see them distributed in the United States of America.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Let me, if I may just briefly say something
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Let us support a tax on carbon
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Look, Wolf
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~many of whom previously had given up.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~may I please
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~maybe I'm a little bit confused.Are you or are you not supporting legislation to lift the cap on taxable income and expand Social Security for 58 years and increase benefits
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~No, I don't think I owe them an apology. They are in court today, and actually they won a preliminary decision today. They have the right to sue, and I support them and anyone else who wants the right to sue.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~No, they wouldn't. Look, here's where we are. Let me reiterate. We have a global crisis. Pope Francis reminded us that we are on a suicide course. Our legislation understands, Errol, that there will be economic dislocation. It is absolutely true. There will be some people who lose their job. And we build into our legislation an enormous amount of money to protect those workers. It is not their fault that fossil fuels are destroying our climate.But we have got to stand up and say right now, as we would if we were attacked by some military force, we have got to move urgently and boldly.What does that mean?
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~No, you didn't. My legi
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~No.[crosstalk]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~not being dependent on Wall Street, or big money, that is the future of the Democratic Party that I want to see. [cheering and applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Not Secretary Clinton's position.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Now, if you're asking not just me, but countries all over the world was that a disproportionate attack, the answer is that I believe it was, and let me say something else. [cheering and applause]And, let me say something else. As somebody who is 100% pro-Israel, in the long run &mdash; and this is not going to be easy, God only knows, but in the long run if we are ever going to bring peace to that region which has seen so much hatred and so much war, we are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity. [cheering and applause]So what is not to say &mdash; to say that right now in Gaza, right now in Gaza unemployment is s somewhere around 40%. You got a log of that area continues, it hasn't been built, decimated, houses decimated health care decimated, schools decimated. I believe the United States and the rest of the world have got to work together to help the Palestinian people.That does not make me anti-Israel. That paves the way, I think
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Oh, you &mdash; ah. [applause] [booing]OK.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~OK.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~responding.All right? When this campaign began, I said that we got to end the starvation minimum wage of $7.25, raise it to $15. Secretary Clinton said let's raise it to $12. There's a difference. And, by the way, what has happened is history has outpaced Secretary Clinton, because all over this country, people are standing up and they're saying $12 is not good enough, we need $15 an hour.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Second of all &mdash; second of all, if I might, in terms of Syria, in terms of Syria
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Secretary Clinton called them out. Oh my goodness, they must have been really crushed by this. And was that before or after you received huge sums of money by giving speaking engagements? So they must have been very, very upset by what you did.Look, here is the difference and here is the clear difference. These banks, in my view, have too much power. They have shown themselves to be fraudulent organizations endangering the well-being of our economy.If elected president, I will break them up. We have got legislation to do that, end of discussion. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Secretary Clinton did not answer one simple question.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Secretary Clinton made this charge in previous debates and just repeating it doesn't make it truer. What you are talking about is what I think was what they call the unanimous consent, you know what that is, where basically, do we support Libya moving to democracy?Well, you know what, I surely have always supported Libya moving to democracy. But please do not confuse that with your active effort for regime change without contemplating what happened the day after. Totally different issue.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~So, yes, we are going to pay for it
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Sure. Sure. The obvious decision is when the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of wall street brought this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession &mdash; the Great Depression of the '30s, when millions of people lost their jobs, and their homes, and their life savings, the obvious response to that is that you've got a bunch of fraudulent operators and that they have got to be broken up.That was my view way back, and I introduced legislation to do that. Now, Secretary Clinton was busy giving speeches to Goldman Sachs for $225,000 a speech. [applause] So the problem response &mdash; the proper response in my view is we should break them up. And that's what my legislation does.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~That's just not accurate. Well
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~That's right. So, let's start off with the basic premise. A few days ago Goldman Sachs formally reached a settlement with the United States government for $5 billion dollars. What Goldman Sachs acknowledged was, essentially, that they were selling fraudulent packages of subprime mortgage loans.Goldman Sachs was not the only bank, other banks, of course, did the same. Now, I don't need Dodd-Frank now to tell me that we have got to break up these banks, A, because they're based on fraudulent principles, and B, because when you have six financial institutions that have assets equivalent to 58% of the GFP of this country, they are just too big, too much concentration of wealth and power.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~The point is we have got to break them up so that they do not pose a systemic risk and so that we have a vibrant economy with a competitive financial system.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~The reason &mdash; the reason why in virtually every contest we are winning by very strong margins younger people &mdash; and I'm not just talking about very young. You know, the older you get, the younger young gets &mdash; 45 or younger &mdash; is I think people are sensing that establishment politics and dependence on Wall Street and big money interest is really never going to address the crises that we face. [applause] And people understand, you can't take money from powerful special interests into your PAC and then really expect the American people to believe you're going to stand up to these powerful special interests. So I am very proud of the fact that we have brought millions of new people into the political process
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~The truth is, and you can speak to my colleagues, we have raised millions of dollars to the DSCC. I have written letter that have raised, if I may use the word, huge amount of money so that's just not accurate.But, I will also say, and this is important and maybe the Secretary disagrees with me, but I am proud that millions of young people who previously were not involved in the political process are now coming into it, and I do believe, I do believe that we have got to open the door of the Democratic party to those people. [applause] And, I think the future of the Democratic party is not simply by raising money from wealthy campaign contributors. I think that the way we are doing it in this campaign
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Then why did she put out that statement?
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~There comes a time &mdash; there comes a time when if we pursue justice and peace, we are going to have to say that Netanyahu is not right all of the time. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Thirdly, we have got to understand that in America, we should be thinking big, not small. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~to an approach that works in the Middle East. [cheering and applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~To suddenly
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~To suddenly announce now that you're for $15, I don't think is quite accurate.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Too many lives have been destroyed because people possessed marijuana, millions over a 30-year period. And that is why I believe we should take marijuana out of the federal Controlled Substance Act. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~We're going to work with state governments all over this country. And you know what? In a very divided Congress, and a very divided politics in America, actually the one area where there is some common ground is conservatives understand that it's insane to be spending $80 billion a year locking up 2.2 million people.With federal and presidential leadership, we will work with state governments to make sure that people are released from jail under strong supervision, that they get the kind of job training and education they need so they can return to their communities. On this one, Errol, actually I think you're going to see progressive and conservative support. We can do it, if we're prepared to be bold.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~We are not a country that has the courage to stand up to big money and do what has to be done for the working families of the country. [applause] Secretary Clinton will have to explain to the people of our country how it could be that every other major country on Earth manages to guarantee health care to all of their people, spending significantly less per capita than we can.I live 50 miles away from Canada, you know? It's not some kind of communist authoritarian country. They're doing OK. They got a health care system that guarantees health care to all people. We can do the same.In terms of public colleges and universities, please don't tell me that we cannot do what many other countries around the world are doing. Kids should not be punished and leave school deeply in debt, for what crime? For trying to get an education.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~We have
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~We need to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all people. So I [applause] my [inaudible].
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~We will get them out.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~well and I
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, as somebody who spent many months of my life when I was a kid in Israel, who has family in Israel, of course Israel has a right not only to defend themselves, but to live in peace and security without fear of terrorist attack. That is not a debate. [applause] But &mdash; but what you just read, yeah, I do believe that. Israel was subjected to terrorist attacks, has every right in the world to destroy terrorism. But we had in the Gaza area &mdash; not a very large area &mdash; some 10,000 civilians who were wounded and some 1,500 who were killed.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, first of all, I disagree with that study. There are many economists who come up with very, very different numbers.For example, we are the only country, major country on Earth, that does not guarantee health care to all people, and yet we end up spending almost three times what the British do, 50 percent more than the French. My proposal, a Medicare-for-all, single-payer program, will save [applause] will save middle-class families many thousands of dollars a year in their health care costs. Public colleges and universities tuition free? Damn right. That is exactly what we should be doing. [applause] And I'd pay for that &mdash; I'd pay for that by telling Wall Street that, yeah, we are going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation, which will bring in more than enough money to provide free tuition at public colleges and universities and lower the outrageous level of student debt.Wolf, we have seen in the last 30 years a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 0.1 percent. The establishment does not like this idea, but, yes, I am determined to transfer that money back to the working families of this country. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, for a start, I would tell the gentleman who's the CEO at Verizon to start negotiating with the Communication Workers of America. [applause] And this is &mdash; this is a perfect example, Wolf, of the kind of corporate greed which is destroying the middle class of this country. This gentleman makes $18 million a year in salary. That's his &mdash; that's his compensation. This gentleman is now negotiating to take away health care benefits of Verizon workers, outsource call center jobs to the Philippines, and &mdash; and trying to create a situation where workers will lose their jobs. He is not investing in the way he should in inner cities in America. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, for a start, we're going to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. [applause] And number two, while it is true we may end up paying a few cents more for a hamburger in McDonald's, at the end of the day, what this economy desperately needs is to rebuild our manufacturing sector with good-paying jobs. [applause] We cannot continue to sustain the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs that we have seen over the last 20, 30 years, based on trade agreements of which Secretary Clinton has voted for almost every one of those. That has got to change.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, I've known Secretary Clinton, how long, 25 years?We worked together in the Senate. And I said that in response to the kind of attacks we were getting from the Clinton, uh, campaign. "Washington Post" headline says "Clinton Campaign says Sanders is Unqualified" and that's what the surrogates were saying.Does Secretary Clinton have the experience and the intelligence to be a president?Of course she does. [applause] But I do question  [applause] but I do question her judgment. I question a judgment which voted for the war in Iraq [applause] the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country, voted for virtually every disastrous trade agreement which cost us millions of decent-paying jobs. And I question her judgment about running super PACs which are collecting tens of millions of dollars from special interests, including $15 million from Wall Street.I don't believe that that is [applause] the kind of judgment we need to be the kind of president we need.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, I think the secretary has confused a lot of people. I don't know how you're there for the fight for $15 when you say you want a $12-an-hour national minimum wage. [applause] Now, in fact &mdash; in fact, there is an effort, Patty Murray has introduced legislation for $12 minimum wage. That's good. I introduced legislation for $15 an hour minimum wage which is better. [applause] And ultimately what we have got to determine is after massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 0.1 percent, when millions of our people are working longer hours for low wages
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, I think we got one that's coming out tomorrow.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, let me respond. Secretary Clinton, you just heard her, everybody else does it, she'll do it. I will do it. [applause] I am going to release all of the transcripts of the speeches that I gave on Wall Street behind closed doors, not for $225,000, not for $2,000, not for two cents. There were no speeches. [applause] And second of all, of course we will release our taxes. Jane does our taxes. We've been a little bit busy lately. You'll excuse us. But we will
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, look
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, look  [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, the only problem is, Wolf, she didn't answer your question.You asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible. You asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible for a lot of the gun violence. You made the point what she said was totally absurd.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, there is no question. I mean, it really is an outrage. And it just continues, the seven-and-a-half years of unbelievable obstructionism we have seen from these right-wing Republicans.I mean, a third-grader in America understands the president of the United States has the right to nominate individuals to the U.S. Supreme Court. Apparently everybody understands that except the Republicans in Congress.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, what I believe, if my memory is correct here, we spend about 75 percent of the entire cost of the military aspect of NATO. Given the fact that France has a very good health care system and free public education, college education for their people, the U.K. has a good National Health Service and they also provide fairly reasonable higher education, you know what, yeah, I do believe that the countries of Europe should pick up more of the burden for their defense. Yes, I do. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, why would I be running for the Democratic nomination to be president of the United States? [applause] But here is a good point. You know, in virtually all of the general election match-up polls between Trump and Secretary Clinton and Trump and Bernie Sanders, in almost all of those polls, I do better than Secretary Clinton both in the CNN poll I was 20 points ahead of Trump.I think Secretary Clinton was 12 points. And you know why? Because in fact a whole lot of people &mdash; this may be a shock to the secretary, but there a whole lot of independents in this country. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, you don't it all out tomorrow. And you certainly don't phase nuclear out tomorrow. But this is what you do do. [applause] What you do do is say that we are going to have a massive program &mdash; and I had introduced &mdash; introduced legislation for 10 million solar rooftops. We can put probably millions of people to work retrofitting and weatherizing buildings all over this country. [cheering]Saving &mdash; rebuilding our rail system. [applause] Our mass transit system. [applause] If we approach this, Errol, as if we were literally at a war &mdash; you know, in 1941, under Franklin Delano Roosevelt, we moved within three years, within three more years to rebuild our economy to defeat Nazism and Japanese imperialism. That is exactly the kind of approach we need right now.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, you got to ask &mdash; you got to ask Trump. All I can tell you is, with a huge deficit, with 47 million people living in poverty, with our inner cities collapsing, yeah, I do think countries like Germany and U.K. and France and European countries whose economy, or at least its standard of living and health care and education, they're doing pretty well.So I would not be embarrassed as president of the United States to stay to our European allies, you know what, the United States of America cannot just support your economies. You got to put up your own fair share of the defense burden. Nothing wrong with that. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~What we need to do is to do everything that we can to make certain that guns do not fall into the hands of people who do not have them.Now, I voted against this gun liability law because I was concerned that in rural areas all over this country, if a gun shop owner sells a weapon legally to somebody, and that person then goes out and kills somebody, I don't believe it is appropriate that that gun shop owner who just sold a legal weapon to be held accountable and be sued.But, what I do believe is when gun shop owners and others knowingly are selling weapons to people who should not have them &mdash; somebody walks in.They want thousands of rounds of ammunition, or they want a whole lot of guns, yes, that gun shop owner or that gun manufacturer should be held liable.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Who not only thinks we are not going to &mdash; not defund Planned Parenthood, we've got to expand funding for Planned Parenthood. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Wolf, thank you very much. CNN, thank you very much. Secretary Clinton, thank you very much.When we began this campaign almost a year ago, we started off at 3 percent in the polls. We were about 70 points behind Secretary Clinton. In the last couple of weeks, there were two polls out there that had us ahead. [applause] Of the last nine caucuses and primaries, we have won eight of them, many of them by landslide victories. [applause] Over the last year, we have received almost 7 million individual campaign contributions, averaging &mdash; guess what &mdash; $27 apiece, more individual campaign contributions than any candidate in American history at this point in a campaign.The reason that our campaign has done so well is because we're doing something very radical: We're telling the American people the truth. And the truth is that this country is not going to move forward in a significant way for working people unless we overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision [applause]  and unless we have real campaign reform so that billionaires and super PACs cannot buy elections. [applause] This campaign is also determined to end a rigged economy where the rich get richer and everybody else get poorer, and create an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.Thank you.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Wolf, the answer is, you know, what we have always done in my family is, Jane does them. And she's been out on the campaign trail. We will get them out. We'll get them out very shortly. It's not a big deal.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Wolf. Wolf.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~yes or no?
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Yes, but here is the point, and obviously i will strongly support that nomination as a member of the Senate. But, if elected president, I would ask the president to withdraw that nomination because I think &mdash; I think this.I think that we need a Supreme Court justice who will make it crystal clear, and this nominee has not yet done that, crystal clear that he or she will vote to overturn Citizens United and make sure that American democracy is not undermined. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Yes, Secretary Clinton [crosstalk] you are a member of the establishment.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Yes.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~You'll get them, yes. Yeah, look, I don't want to get anybody very excited. They are very boring tax returns. No big money from speeches, no major investments. Unfortunately &mdash; unfortunately, I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate. And that's what that will show. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~You're looking at a senator and former congressman who proudly has a 100 percent pro-choice voting record, who will take on those Republican governors who are trying to restrict a woman's right to choose, who will take on those governors right now who are discriminating outrageously against the LGBT community, who comes from a state which led the effort for gay marriage in this country, proudly so. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~You gave a major speech to AIPAC, which obviously deals with the Middle East crisis, and you barely mentioned the Palestinians. And I think, again, it is a complicated issue and God knows for decades presidents, including President Clinton and others, Jimmy Carter and others have tried to do the right thing.All that I am saying is we cannot continue to be one-sided. There are two sides to the issue.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~You have sup
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Absolutely. You know, this is what I've saying for the past year. No bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail.I have been talking about what we should be doing under Dodd-Frank. I'm glad that Senator Sanders is now joining in talking about Dodd-Frank, because Dodd-Frank sets forth the approach that needs to be taken. I believe, and I will appoint regulators who are tough enough and ready enough to break up any bank that fails the test under Dodd-Frank.There are two sections there. If they fail either one, that they're a systemic risk, a grave risk to our economy, or if they fail the other, that their living wills, which is what you're referring to, is inadequate.Let's look at what is at stake here. We can never let Wall Street wreck Main street again. I spoke out against Wall Street when I was a Senator from New York. I have been standing up and saying continuously we have the law. We've got to execute under it. So, you're right. I will move immediately to break up any financial institution, but I go further because I want the law to extend to those that are part of the shadow banking industry. The big insurance companies, the hedge funds, something that I have been arguing for now a long time
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~All right. I have said from the very beginning that I supported the fight for $15. I supported those on the front lines of the fight for &mdash; it happens to be true. I also &mdash; I supported the $15 effort in L.A. I supported in Seattle. I supported it for the fast food workers in New York.The minimum wage at the national level right now is $7.25, right? We want to raise it higher than it ever has been, but we also have to recognize some states and some cities will go higher, and I support that. I have taken my cue from the Democrats in the Senate, led by Senator Patty Murray and others, like my good friend Kirsten Gillibrand, who has said we will set a national level of $12 and then urge any place that can go above it to go above it.Going from $7.25 to $12 is a huge difference. Thirty-five million people will get a raise. One in four working mothers will get a raise. I want to get something done. And I think setting the goal to get to $12 is the way to go, encouraging others to get to $15. But, of course, if we have a Democratic Congress, we will go to $15. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~And hold them accountable as well. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~And my approach I think is going to get us there faster without tying us up into political knots with a Congress that still would not support what you are proposing.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~and to be really focused on how we build ladders of opportunity and tear down these barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~and well-funded
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~And, I know something about that
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~And, I want to say &mdash; I also want to say that I do &mdash; I do think it is absolutely critical and incredible that we have so many young people involved in the political process. I applaud all of those who are applauding you, Senator Sanders. We're happy that they are supporting you, that they are passionately committed to you and to the issues.But, let me also say it's going to be important that we unify the Democratic party when the nomination process has been completed
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~And, our President led the effort to protect our world and he deserve our appreciation, not our criticism
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~but the fact is he did.And that contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers and started the cascade  [applause] [crosstalk]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~But what I have also said is that we've got to be smart about it, just the way Governor Cuomo was here in New York. If you look at it, we moved more quickly to $15 in New York City, more deliberately toward $12, $12.50 upstate then to $15. That is exactly my position. It's a model for the nation and that's what I will do as president.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Come on, I have stood on the debate stage
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Dana, you know &mdash; I love being in Brooklyn. [cheering and applause]Dana, let me add here that there are two ways to at this under Dodd-Frank, which is after all the law we passed under President Obama, and I'm proud that Barney Frank, one of the authors, has endorsed me because what I have said continuously is, yes, sometimes the government may have to order certain actions. Sometime the government can permit the institution themselves to take those actions. That has to be the judgement of the regulators.But, there's another element to this. I believe strongly that executives of any of these organizations should be financially penalized if there is a settlement. [applause] They should have to pay up through compensation or bonuses because we have to go after not just the big giant institution, we have got to go after the people who are making the decisions in the institutions.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Exact same thing.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Go as quickly as [crosstalk] to get to $15. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I &mdash; as he said, I've said the same thing for years. I didn't say anything different tonight. We are going to extend the Social Security Trust Fund. There is still something called Congress. Now, I happen to support Democrats and I want to get Democrats to take back the majority in the United States Senate
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I am
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I am not going to contradict the president's strategy on this. And I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals. I fully support the president. [applause] And I believe that the president &mdash; the president is on the right side of both the Constitution and history. And the Senate needs to immediately begin to respond. So I'm going to support the president. When I am president, I will take stock of where we are and move from there.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I did answer the
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I did. If that's the way we're
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I have said repeatedly, Wolf, I am going to make the wealthy pay into Social Security to extend the Social Security Trust Fund. That is one way. If that is the way that we pursue, I will follow that.But there are other ways. We should be looking at taxing passive income by wealthy people. We should be looking at taxing all of their investment.But here's the real issue, because I &mdash; I've heard this, I've seen the reports of it. I have said from the very beginning, we are going to protect Social Security. I was one of the leaders in the fight against Bush when he was trying to privatize Social Security.But we also, in addition to extending the Trust Fund, which I am absolutely determined to do, we've got to help people who are not being taken care of now. And because Social Security started in the 1930s, a lot of women have been left out and left behind.And it's time that we provide more benefits for widows, divorcees, for caregivers, for women who deserve more from the Social Security
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I have said the
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I have said yes, we are going to pick the best way or combination
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I have said, look, there are certain &mdash; there are certain expectations when you run for president. This is a new one. And I've said, if everybody agrees to do it &mdash; because there are speeches for money on the other side. I know that.But I will tell you this, there is &mdash; there is a long-standing expectation that everybody running release their tax returns, and you can go &mdash; you can go to my website and see eight years of tax returns. And I've released 30 years of tax returns. And I think every candidate, including Senator Sanders and Donald Trump, should do the same. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I have supported it. You know, we are in vigorous agreement here, Senator.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I negotiated the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in November of 2012. I did it in concert with  [applause] President Abbas of the Palestinian authority based in Ramallah, I did it with the then Muslim Brotherhood President, Morsi, based in Cairo, working closely with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli cabinet. I can tell you right now I have been there with Israeli officials going back more than 25 years that they do not seek this kind of attacks. They do not invite the rockets raining down on their towns and villages. [applause] They do not believe that there should be a constant incitement by Hamas aided and abetted by Iran against Israel. And, so when it came time after they had taken the incoming rockets, taken the assaults and ambushes on their soldiers and they called and told me, I was in Cambodia, that they were getting ready to have to invade Gaza again because they couldn't find anybody to talk to tell them to stop it, I flew all night, I got there, I negotiated that.So, I don't know how you run a country when you are under constant threat, terrorist tact, rockets coming at you. You have a right to defend yourself. [applause] That does not mean &mdash; that does not mean that you don't take appropriate precautions. And, I understand that there's always second guessing anytime there is a war. It also does not mean that we should not continue to do everything we can to try to reach a two-state solution, which would give the Palestinians the rights and
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I put it out
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I support our continuing involvement in NATO. And it is important to ask for our NATO allies to pay more of the cost. There is a requirement that they should be doing so, and I believe that needs to be enforced.But there's a larger question here. NATO has been the most successful military alliance in probably human history. It has bound together across the Atlantic countries that are democracies, that have many of the same values and interests, and now we need to modernize it and move it into the 21st century to serve as that head of our defense operations in Europe when it comes to terrorism and other threats that we face. So
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I think it's &mdash; I think it's important for people out there watching this tonight to know that I also have a considerable lead in pledged delegates. And my lead in pledged delegates is actually wider than Barack Obama's lead was over me.And in addition to winning states in the Deep South, we won Florida, Texas, Arizona, Massachusetts, Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina, Missouri. [applause] And so I think where we stand today is that we are in this campaign very confident and optimistic, but it all comes down to reaching every single voter. I'm not taking anything for granted or any voter or any place.So I'm going to work my heart out here in New York until the polls close on Tuesday. I'm going to work in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware and Maryland, all the way through California. And when we end up with the number of delegates we need, we will unite the party and have a unified convention
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I think it's important [applause] to point out that [applause] you know, we're &mdash; we're having a discussion about the best way to raise money from wealthy people to extend the Social Security Trust Fund. Think about what the other side wants to do. They're calling Social Security a Ponzi scheme. They still want to privatize it.In fact, their whole idea is to turn over the Social Security Trust Fund to Wall Street, something you and I would never let happen.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I will certainly be willing to answer it. I think I did answer it by saying that of course there have to be precautions taken but even the most independent analyst will say the way that Hamas places its weapons, the way that it often has its fighters in civilian garb, it is terrible.I'm not saying it's anything other than terrible. It would be great &mdash; remember, Israel left Gaza. They took out all the Israelis. They turned the keys over to the Palestinian people.And what happened? Hamas took over Gaza.So instead of having a thriving economy with the kind of opportunities that the children of the Palestinians deserve, we have a terrorist haven that is getting more and more rockets shipped in from Iran and elsewhere.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~I will stay in NATO. I will stay in NATO, and we will continue to look for missions and other kinds of programs that they will support. Remember, NATO was with us in Afghanistan. Most of the member countries also lost soldiers and civilians in Afghanistan. They came to our rallying defense after 9/11. That meant a lot.And, yes, we have to work out the financial aspects of it, but let's not forget what's really happening. With Russia being more aggressive, making all kinds of intimidating moves toward the Baltic countries, we've seen what they've done in Eastern Ukraine, we know how they want to rewrite the map of Europe, it is not in our interests. Think of how much it would cost if Russia's aggression were not deterred because NATO was there on the front lines making it clear they could not move forward. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~If we can [crosstalk] raise it to $15 in New York [crosstalk] or Los Angeles or Seattle
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~in the 1990s, we got 23 million new jobs and incomes went up for everybody.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~into my mouth and say something
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~just let me finish. The rights and the autonomy that they deserve. And, let me say this, if Yasser Arafat had agreed with my husband at Camp David in the Late 1990s to the offer then Prime Minister Barat put on the table, we would have had a Palestinian state for 15 years. [cheering and applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~let's do it.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Let's do that again in America.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~let's get to 100 percent coverage, let's get the cost down, and let's guarantee health care.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~let me just say
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~let me let me say
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~let me say this  [applause] we are going to extend the Social Security Trust Fund. We've got some good ideas to do it. Let's get a Congress elected
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Let us talk about where we are in this race. I've gotten more votes than anybody running. 9.6 million at the last count. [cheering and applause]That is 2.3 million more than Senator Sanders. [applause] And it is 1.4 million more than Donald Trump. [cheering and applause]I think you have to look at the facts. And, the facts are that I'm putting together a very broad-based, inclusive coalition from the South to the North, from the East to the West, with African-American, Latinos, women, union households, working people and I am very proud of the campaign we are running. It is a campaign that will not only capture the Democratic nomination, but a campaign that will defeat whoever the Republican end up nominating. [cheering and applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~No, of course not. Of course not. This is &mdash; this is a serious difference between us. [laughter]And what I want to start by saying &mdash; it's not a laughing matter &mdash; 90 people on average a day are killed or commit suicide or die in accidents from guns, 33,000 people a year. I take it really seriously, because I have spent more time than I care to remember being with people who have lost their loved ones.So, yes, we have a problem in America. We need a president who will stand up against the gun lobby. We need a president who will fight for commonsense gun safety reforms. [applause] And what we have here is a big difference. Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill five times. He voted for the most important NRA priority, namely giving immunity from liability to gun-makers and dealers, something that is at the root of a lot of the problems that we are facing.Then he doubled down on that in the New York Daily News interview, when asked whether he would support the Sandy Hook parents suing to try to do something to rein in the advertising of the AR-15, which is advertised to young people as being a combat weapon, killing on the battlefield. He said they didn't deserve their day in court.I could not disagree more.And, finally, this is the only industry in America, the only one. [applause] That has this kind of special protection. We hear a lot from Senator Sanders about the greed and recklessness of Wall Street, and I agree. We've got to hold Wall Street accountable
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~No, well, I don't think I've changed my view on what we need to do to go from where we are, where the world is heavily dependent on coal and oil, but principally coal, to where we need to be, which is clean renewable energy, and one of the bridge fuels is natural gas.And so for both economic and environmental and strategic reasons, it was American policy to try to help countries get out from under the constant use of coal, building coal plants all the time, also to get out from under, especially if they were in Europe, the pressure from Russia, which has been incredibly intense. So we did say natural gas is a bridge. We want to cross that bridge as quickly as possible, because in order to deal with climate change, we have got to move as rapidly as we can.That's why I've set big goals. I want to see us deploy a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term and enough clean energy to provide electricity to every home in America within 10 years. [applause] So I have big, bold goals, but I know in order to get from where we are, where the world is still burning way too much coal, where the world is still too intimidated by countries and providers like Russia, we have got to make a very firm but decisive move in the direction of clean energy.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~No.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Now, let me say this
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~OK.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~OK. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~or combination of ways [booing] you know [booing] it &mdash; it's all &mdash; it's always a little bit, uh, challenging because, you know, if Senator Sanders doesn't agree with how you are approaching something, then you are a member of the establishment.Well, let me say then
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Right.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~so a lot of &mdash; a lot of what we're talking about can actually be implemented
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~So I support Dodd-Frank, but I have consistently said that's not enough. We've got to include the shadow banking sector.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~So, yes, we both want to make sure  [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Social Security [inaudible]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~system and that will be my highest priority.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Thank you so much. Because, when I went to the very end of the 2008 campaign with then Senator Obama
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Thank you. I am very grateful for the fact that the people of New York gave me the great honor of serving as your senator. You took a chance on me in 2000, and then you re-elected me with one of the biggest margins we've had in our state in 2006. During those years, we worked closely together. I tried to have your back, and time and time again, you had mine.We took on the challenges of 9/11 together. We got the money to rebuild New York. We came to the aid of our brave first responders, construction workers, and others who endangered their own health by helping to save lives and search for survivors. [applause] We worked to create jobs &mdash; despite the disastrous policies of George W. Bush &mdash; across New York. And we stood up time and time again against all kinds of vested powerful interests.I'm asking for your support again in the primary on Tuesday to continue that work together, to take what we did in New York and to take those New York values to the White House, and put them to work on behalf of all of our people, to knock down the barriers that stand in the way.You know, of course we have economic barriers. I've been fighting against those trying to even the odds most of my adult life. But we also have racial barriers, gender barriers, homophobic barriers, disability barriers. [applause] We have a lot of barriers that stand in the way of people being treated as they should and having the chance to live up to their own God-given potential.So I am humbly asking for your support on Tuesday. I'll work my heart out for you again. And together, we won't just make promises we can't keep. We'll deliver results that will improve the lives of the people in New York and in America. [applause] That's what we'll do together. Thank you, New York. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Thank you. Thank you very much.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~that's not accurate.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~that we'll go onto the general election with.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~that will actually agree
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~The fine print says this, that it will &mdash; the federal government will cover two-thirds of the cost and require the states, even those led by Republican governors
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~The NRA came to their supporters in the Congress and said, stop it, stop it now, and Senator Sanders joined those who did.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~There was also in that a reference to the Security Council, and I know you're not shy when you oppose something, Senator. So, yes, it was unanimous. That's exactly right, including you.And what we did was to try to provide support for our European and Arab allies and partners. The decision was the president's. Did I do the due diligence? Did I talk to everybody I could talk to? Did I visit every capital and then report back to the president? Yes, I did. That's what a secretary of state does.But at the end of the day, those are the decisions that are made by the president to in any way use American military power. And the president made that decision. And, yes, we did try without success because of the Libyans' obstruction to our efforts, but we did try and we will continue to try to help the Libyan people.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~to carry out what the remaining one-third of the cost.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~To tackle systemic racism and divert people in the beginning.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~voted for it. I'm sorry for the consequences that were unintended and that have had a very unfortunate impact on people's lives.I've seen the results of what has happened in families and in communities.That's why I chose to make my very first speech a year ago on this issue, Errol, because I want to focus the attention of our country and to make the changes we need to make. And I also want people [applause] especially I want &mdash; I want white people &mdash; I want white people to recognize that there is systemic racism. It's also in employment, it's in housing, but it is in the criminal justice system, as well. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~wait a minute.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~wait, wait
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~We are going [applause] we are  [applause] we are going
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~We did unify the party, and we did elect a Democratic president
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~We have &mdash; we have a difference of opinion. We both want to get to universal health care coverage. I did stand up to the special interests and the powerful forces, the health insurance companies and the drug companies. [applause] And perhaps that's why I am so much in favor of supporting President Obama's signature accomplishment with the Affordable Care Act, because I know how hard it was to get that passed, even with a Democratic Congress. So rather than letting the Republicans repeal it or rather starting all over again, trying to throw the country into another really contentious debate, let's make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~We went to the United Nations &mdash; yes, he did. We went to the United Nations Security Council. We got support from the Security Council. And we then supported the efforts of our European and Arab allies and partners.This was a request made to our government by the Europeans and by the Arabs because of their great fear of what chaos in Syria would do to them. And if you want to know what chaos does, not just to the people inside but the people on the borders, look at Syria.Nobody stood up to Assad and removed him, and we have had a far greater disaster in Syria than we are currently dealing with right now in Libya. [applause] [crosstalk]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, again &mdash; again, I absolutely agree with the diagnosis, the diagnosis that we've got to do much more to finish the work of getting universal health care coverage, something that I've worked on for 25 years. Before there was something called Obamacare, there was something called Hillarycare. And we're now at 90 percent of coverage; I'm going to get us to 100 percent.And with respect to college, I think we have to make college affordable. We are pricing out middle-class, working, and poor families. There's no doubt about that.But I do think when you make proposals and you're running for president, you should be held accountable for whether or not the numbers add up and whether or not the plans [applause] are actually going to work. And just very briefly, on health care, most of the people who have analyzed what Senator Sanders put out &mdash; remember, he had a plan for about, I don't know, 18, 20 years. He changed in the middle of this campaign. He put out another plan. People have been analyzing the new plan. And there is no doubt by those who have analyzed it, progressive economists, health economists, and the like, that it would pose an incredible burden, not just on the budget, but on individuals. In fact, the Washington Post called it a train-wreck for the poor. A working woman on Medicaid who already has health insurance would be expected to pay about $2,300.The same for free college. The free college offer &mdash; you know, my late father said, if somebody promises you something for free, read the fine print. You read the fine print, and here's what it says.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, don't &mdash; don't put words
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, first of all, I do have a very comprehensive plan to create more jobs and I think that has to be at the center of our economic approach. And so I think it is important that we do more on manufacturing. I went to Syracuse and laid out a $10 billion plan that would, I believe, really jump-start advanced manufacturing.I have seen the results of what can happen when we have the government cooperating with business. And that's exactly what I will do.When I was secretary of State, I helped to lead the way to increased exports of American good around the world, which supports tens of thousands of jobs.So I think you've got to go at this with a sense of how to accomplish the goal we are setting &mdash; more good jobs with rising incomes for people everywhere from inner cities to rural areas to every distressed community in America. And that's exactly what my plan would bring about.I think we have a pretty good record if we look at what happened
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, first of all, it's great to be here in New York, and I am delighted to [applause]  have this chance to discuss the issues that are important to our future. I was so honored to serve as a senator from New York for eight years [applause] and to work to provide opportunity for all of our citizens to make it possible that we could knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying ahead.And during those eight years, we faced some difficult challenges together. We faced 9/11. We worked hard to rebuild New York. I was particularly concerned about our first responders and others who'd been affected in their health by what they had experienced. We worked hard to bring jobs from Buffalo to Albany and all parts of New York to give more hard-working people a chance to really make the most out of their own talents.And we worked hard to really keep New York values at the center of who we are and what we do together. [applause] And that is &mdash; that is exactly what I want to do as your president. We will celebrate our diversity. We will work together, bringing us back to being united, setting some big, bold, progressive goals for America. That's what I'm offering in this campaign, to build on the work, to build on the value that we share here in New York, to take those to Washington, and to knock down those barriers that in any way hold back not only individual Americans, bur our country from reaching our full potential. That is what my campaign is about. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, I'm a little bewildered about how to respond when you have an agreement which gives you the framework to actually take the action that would have only come about because under the Obama administration in the face of implacable hostility from the Republicans in Congress, President Obama moved forward on gas mileage, he moved forward on the clean power plant. He has moved forward on so many of the fronts that he could given the executive actions that he was able to take. [applause] And, you know, I am getting a little bit &mdash; I'm getting a little bit concerned here because, you know, I really believe that the President has done an incredible job against great odds and deserves to be supported. [cheering and applause]Now, it's easy &mdash; it's easy to diagnose the problem. It's harder to do something about the problem. And  [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, I believe that the law that Senator Sanders voted for that I voted against, giving this special protection to gun manufacturers and to dealers, is an absolute abdication of responsibility on the part of those who voted for it.This is a &mdash; this is a unique gift given to only one industry in the world by the United States Congress, as Senator Murphy from Connecticut said, we have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns.And the point that Senator Sanders keeps making about how he wouldn't want a mom and pop store &mdash; that was not the point of this. And if he can point to any, any incident where that happened, I would love to hear about it.What was really going on, I'll tell you, because it has a lot to do with New York City. New York City was on the brink of being able to hold manufacturers and dealers accountable through a very carefully crafted legal strategy.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, I think Senator Sanders has just reinforced my point. Yes, when I was secretary of state I did urge, along with the Department of Defense and the CIA that we seek out, vet, and train, and arm Syrian opposition figures so that they could defend themselves against Assad.The president said no. Now, that's how it works. People who work for the president make recommendations and then the president makes the decision. So I think it's only fair to look at where we are in Syria today.And, yes, I do still support a no-fly zone because I think we need to put in safe havens for those poor Syrians who are fleeing both Assad and ISIS and have some place that they can be safe.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, I think that it had some positive aspects to it. And you mentioned some of them. The Violence Against Women Act, which has been a very important piece of legislation, in my opinion. [applause] And it also did some things which were to provide more opportunities for young people. So if we were to have the balance sheet on one side, there are some positive actions and changes.On the other side, there were decisions that were made that now we must revisit and we have to correct. I think that sentences got much too long. The original idea was not that we would increase sentences for non-violent low-level offenders, but once the federal government did what it did, states piled on.So we have a problem. And the very first speech I gave in this campaign was about what I will do to reform the criminal justice system and end the over-mass incarceration.So I think that if all of us go and look back at where we were, Senator Sanders voted for the crime bill, and he says the same thing, there were some good things, and things that we have to change and learn from.So that's how I see it. And I think we ought to be putting our attention on forging a consensus to make the changes that will divert more people from the criminal justice system to start.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, if I &mdash; I want to add, you know, again describing the problem is a lot easier than trying to solve it. And I have been involved, both as first lady with my husband's efforts, as a senator supporting the efforts that even the Bush administration was undertaking, and as secretary of state for President Obama, I'm the person who held the last three meetings between the president of the Palestinian Authority and the prime minister of Israel.There were only four of us in the room, Netanyahu, Abbas, George Mitchell, and me. Three long meetings. And I was absolutely focused on what was fair and right for the Palestinians.I was absolutely focused on what we needed to do to make sure that the Palestinian people had the right to self-government. And I believe that as president I will be able to continue to make progress and get an agreement that will be fair both to the Israelis and the Palestinians without ever, ever undermining Israel's security. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, it is true that now that the spotlight is pretty bright here in New York, some things have been said and Senator Sanders did call me unqualified. I've been called a lot of things in my life. That was a first. [laughter]And then he did say that  [applause] he had to question my judgment. Well, the people of New York voted for me twice to be their senator from New York and [applause] and [applause] and President Obama trusted my judgment enough to ask me to be secretary of State for the United States. [applause] So, look, we have disagreements on policy. There's no doubt about it. But if you go and read, which I hope all of you will before Tuesday, Senator Sanders' long interview with the "New York Daily News," talk about judgment and talk about the kinds of problems he had answering questions about even his core issue, breaking up the banks.When asked, he could not explain how [laughter] that would be done and [applause] when asked [applause] when asked about a number of foreign policy issues, he could not answer about Afghanistan, about Israel, about counterterrorism, except to say if he'd had some paper in front of him, maybe he could.I think you need to have the judgment on day one to be both president and commander-in-chief.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, let's talk about the global environmental crisis. Starting in 2009 as your Secretary of State, I worked with President Obama to bring China and India to the table for the very first time, to get a commitment out of them that they would begin to address their own greenhouse gas emissions. [applause] I continued to work on that throughout the four years as Secretary of State, and I was very proud that President Obama and America led the way to the agreement that was finally reached in Paris with 195 nations committing to take steps to actually make a difference in climate change. [applause] And, I was surprised and disappointed when Senator Sanders attacked the agreement, said it was not enough, it didn't go far enough. You know, at some point putting together 195 countries, I know a little bit about that, was a major accomplishment
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, let me
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, let me say I think we did a great deal to help the Libyan people after Qadafi's demise. And here's what we did.We helped them hold two successful elections, something that is not easy, which they did very well because they had a pent up desire to try to chart their own future after 42 years of dictatorship.I was very proud of that.We got rid of the chemical weapons stockpile that Qadafi had, getting it out of Libya, getting it away from militias or terrorist groups.We also worked to help them set up their government. We sent a lot of American experts there. We offered to help them secure their borders, to train a new military.They, at the end, when it came to security issues, Wolf, did not want troops from any other country, not just us, European or other countries, in Libya.And so we were caught in a very difficult position. They could not provide security on their own, which we could see and we told them that, but they didn't want to have others helping to provide that security.And the result has been a clash between different parts of the country, terrorists taking up some locations in the country.And we can't walk away from that. We need to be working with European and Arab partners
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, let me start by saying we need to talk about this issue and we should talk about it in terms of the extraordinary threats that climate change pose to our country and our world. And that's why for the last many years, both in the Senate and as secretary of State, it's been a big part of my commitment to see what could be done.But there has never been any doubt that when I was a senator, I tried &mdash; I joined with others to try to get rid of the subsidies for big oil. And I have proposed that again, because that's what I think needs to be done as we transition from fossil fuels to clean energy.And everyone who's looked at this independently, "The Washington Post" and others, who give us both hard times when called for on facts, have said that this is absolutely an incorrect false charge.So, we both have relatively small amounts of contributions from people who work for fossil fuel companies. Best we can tell from the reports that are done.But, that is not being supported by big oil, and I think it's important to distinguish that. And, let's talk about what each of us has proposed to try to combat greenhouse gas emissions and put us on the fastest track possible to clean energy.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, look, I supported the crime bill. My husband has apologized. He was the president who actually signed it, Senator Sanders
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, look, I think that, as Senator Sanders said about what I said, I will say about what he said. I think that we recognize that we have a set of problems that we cannot ignore and we must address. And that is why I have been promoting for my entire adult life, I think, the idea of investing early in kids, early childhood education, universal pre-K, like what Mayor de Blasio brought to New York. We have got to help more kids get off to a good start. That's why I want a good teacher in a good school for every child, regardless of the ZIP Code that child lives in
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, make &mdash; make no mistake about it, this is not just an attack on me, it's an attack on President Obama. President Obama [booing]You know, let me tell you why. You may not like the answer, but I'll tell you why. President Obama had a super PAC when he ran. President Obama took tens of millions of dollars from contributors. And President Obama was not at all influenced when he made the decision to pass and sign Dodd-Frank, the toughest regulations [applause] on Wall Street in many a year.So this is &mdash; this is a phony &mdash; this is a phony attack that is designed to raise questions when there is no evidence or support, to undergird the continuation that he is putting forward in these attacks.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, of course I would. And I have supported [applause] I have supported the fight for 15. I am proud to have the endorsement of most of the unions that have led the fight for 15. I was proud to stand on the stage with Governor Cuomo, with SEIU and others who have been leading this battle and I will work as hard as I can to raise the minimum wage. I always have. I supported that when I was in the Senate.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, that isn't
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, the facts are that most of the guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from out of state. They come from the states that don't have kind of serious efforts to control guns that we do in New York.But let me say this &mdash; in 1988, as we've heard on every debate occasion, Senator Sanders did run for the Congress and he lost. He came back in 1990 and he won, and during that campaign he made a commitment to the NRA that he would be against waiting periods.And, in fact, in his own book, he talks about his 1990 campaign, and here's what he said. He clearly was helped by the NRA, because they ran ads against his opponent. So, then he went to the Congress, where he has been a largely very reliable supporter of the NRA. Voting &mdash; he kept his word to the NRA, he voted against the Brady Bill five times because it had waiting periods in it.Thankfully, enough people finally voted for it to keep guns out of the hands of who should not have them. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, what about the greed and recklessness of gun manufacturers and dealers in America? [cheering and applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, you can tell, Dana, he cannot come up with any example, because there is no example. [applause] It is important &mdash; it's always important. It may be inconvenient, but it's always important to get the facts straight. I stood up against the behaviors of the banks when I was a senator.I called them out on their mortgage behavior. I also was very willing to speak out against some of the special privileges they had under the tax code. When I went to the secretary of state office, the president &mdash; President Obama led the effort to pass the Dodd-Frank bill.That is the law. Now, this is our ninth debate. In the prior eight debates, I have said, we have a law. You don't just say, we're upset about this. I'm upset about it. You don't just say, go break them up. You have a law, because we are a nation of laws.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Well, you know, there are a lot of copy machines around.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~when I am president.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~with Senator Sanders eight [crosstalk] times.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~with the United Nations in order to continue to try to support them.The Libyan people deserve a chance at democracy and self- government. And I, as president, will keep trying to give that to them
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~with us in doing it.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~yes, I did.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~yes, of course they should be paying more, but that doesn't mean if they don't we leave, because I don't think that's in America's interests.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~Yes, well, I [applause] I [applause] I &mdash; I would just point out that there was a vote in the Senate as to whether or not the United States should support the efforts by the Libyan people to protect themselves against the threats, the genocidal threats coming from Gadhafi, and whether we should go to the United Nations to seek Security Council support.Senator sanders voted for that, and that's exactly what we did.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~You know, first of all &mdash; first of all, there isn't an issue. When I was in public service serving as the senator from New York, I did stand up to the banks. I did make it clear that their behavior would not be excused.I'm the only one on this stage who did not vote to deregulate swaps and derivatives, as Senator Sanders did, which led to a lot of the problems that we had with Lehman Brothers.Now, if you're going to look at the problems that actually caused the Great Recession, you've got to look at the whole picture. It was a giant insurance company, AIG. It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers. It was mortgage companies like Countrywide.I'm not saying that Senator Sanders did something untoward when he voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~You know, I have laid out a set of actions that build on what President Obama was able to accomplish, building on the clean power plan, which is currently under attack by fossil fuels and the right in the Supreme Court, which is one of the reasons why we need to get the Supreme Court justice that President Obama has nominated to be confirmed so that we can actually continue to make progress.I don't take a back seat to your legislation that you've introduced that you haven't been able to get passed. I want to do what we can do to actually make progress in dealing with the crisis. That's exactly what I have proposed.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~you know, I have spoken about and written at some length the very candid conversations I've had with him and other Israeli leaders. Nobody is saying that any individual leader is always right, but it is a difficult position.If you are from whatever perspective trying to seek peace, trying to create the conditions for peace when there is a terrorist group embedded in Gaza that does not want to see you exist, that is a very difficult challenge.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~You know, let's set the same standard for everybody. When everybody does it, OK, I will do it, but let's set and expect the same standard on tax returns. Everybody does it, and then we move forward.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~You know, there is no doubt that the only people that I would ever appoint to the Supreme Court are people who believe that Roe V. Wade is settled law and Citizens United needs to be overturned.And I want to say something about this since we're talking about the Supreme Court and what's at stake. We've had eight debates before, this is our ninth. We've not had one question about a woman's right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care, not one question. [applause] And in the meantime we have states, governors doing everything they can to restrict women's rights. We have a presidential candidate by the name of Donald Trump saying that women should be punished. And we are never asked about this.And to be complete in my concern, Senator Sanders says with respect to Trump it was a distraction. I don't think it's a distraction. It goes to the heart of who we are as women, our rights, our autonomy, our ability to make our own decisions, and we need to be talking about that and defending Planned Parenthood from these outrageous attacks.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York~April 14, 2016~You know, wait a minute
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~A couple of years ago, when we understood that veterans were not getting the quality care they needed in the timely manner, I worked with folks like John McCain and others to pass the most comprehensive veteran's health care legislation in modern history.But let me rephrase your question because I think, in all do respect, you're expression. In all do respect, you're missing the main point. And the main point in the Congress, it's not the Republicans and Democrats hate each other.That's a mythology from the media. The real issue is that Congress is owned by big money and refuses to do what the American people want them to do. [applause]The real issue is that in area after area, raising the minimum wage to $15 bucks an hour. The American people want it. Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, creating 13 million jobs, the American people want it. The pay equity for women, the American people want it. Demanding that the wealthy start paying their fair share of taxes. The American people want it.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~a part of that.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Absolutely. This is a responsibility for the U.S. Justice Department to get involved. Whenever anybody in this country is killed while in police custody, it should automatically trigger a U.S. attorney general's investigation. [applause]Second of all, and I speak as a mayor who worked very closely and well with police officers, the vast majority of whom are honest, hard- working people trying to do a difficult job, but let us be clear.If a police officer breaks the law, like any public official, that officer must be held accountable. [applause]And thirdly, we have got to de-militarize our police departments so they don't look like occupying armies. We've got to move toward community policing.And fourthly, we have got to make our police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~And I respectfully disagree with my friend over here. And that is, you are right. All of us have denounced Trump's attempts to divide this country: the anti-Latino rhetoric, the racist rhetoric, he anti-Muslim rhetoric.But where I disagree with you, Governor O'Malley, is I do believe we have to deal with the fundamental issues of a handful of billionaires
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~And I respectfully disagree.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Andrea, let me just say this.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Anyone who wants to check my record in taking on Wall Street, in fighting against the deregulation of Wall Street when Wall Street put billions of dollars in lobbying, in campaign contributions to get the government off their backs. They got the government off their backs.Turns out that they were crooks, and they destroyed our economy. I think it's time to put the government back on their backs. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~As everybody you know, this is incredibly complicated and difficult issue and I applaud. I know President Obama's been getting a lot of criticism on this. I think he is doing the right thing.What the nightmare is, which many of my Republican colleagues appear to want is to not have learned the lesson of Iraq. To get American young men and women involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of Syria and the Middle East would be an unmitigated disaster that as president, I will do everything in my power to avoid.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Because of what I believe in what I was just saying. The Democratic party needs major reform. To those of you in South Carolina, you know what, in Mississippi, we need a 50-state strategy so that people in South Carolina and Mississippi can get the resources that they need.Instead of being dependent on super PACs, what we need is to be dependent on small, individual campaign contributors. We need an agenda that speaks to the needs of working families and low-income people. Not wealthy campaign contributors.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~But &mdash; what if we have
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~campaign contributions.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Can I get 50 seconds?
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Can I get a &mdash; can I just get a very brief response? Very brief.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~criminal justice system, investing in jobs, and education not in jails and incarceration .
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Did I say that?
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Good. You're right. I want to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, create 13 million jobs. We do that by doing away with the absurd loophole that now allows major profitable corporations to stash their money in the Cayman Islands, and not in some years, pay a nickel in taxes. Yes, I do. I plead guilty. I want every kid in this country who has the ability to be able to go to a public college, or university, tuition free. And, by the way, I want to substantially lower student debt interest rates in this country as well.How do I pay for it? [applause]I pay for it through a tax on Wall Street speculation. This country, and the middle class, bailed out Wall Street. Now, it is Wall Street's time to help the middle class. In fact
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Great ideas, Governor O'Malley, Secretary Clinton, but here's the truth. If you have an administration stacked with Wall Street appointees, it ain't going to accomplish very much.So here's a promise that I make &mdash; and I mentioned a moment ago how corrupt the system is &mdash; Goldman Sachs, paying a $5 billion fine, gives this country, in recent history, a Republican secretary of treasury, a Democratic secretary of treasury.Here's a promise. If elected president, Goldman Sachs is not going to have &mdash; bring forth a secretary of treasury for a Sanders administration. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~healthcare with mental health
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Here is the main two points
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~I apologize for not hearing all of that question.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~I do.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~I got it.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~I think we already are. Younger generation understands it instinctively.I was home in Burlington, Vermont, on Christmas Eve, the temperature was 65 degrees. People in Vermont know what's going on. People who did ice fishing, where their ice is no longer there on the lake understand what's going on.I'm on both the Environmental and Energy Committees. The debate is over. Climate change is real. It is already causing major problems. And if we do not act boldly and decisively, a bad situation will become worse.It is amazing to me, and I think we'll have agreement on this up here, that we have a major party, called the Republican Party that is so owned by the fossil fuel industry and their campaign contributions that they don't even have the courage, the decency to listen to the scientists. [applause]It is beyond my comprehension how we can elect a president of the United States, somebody like Trump, who believes that climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese. [laughter]Bottom line is, we need to be bold and decisive, we can create millions of jobs. We must, for the sake of our kids and grandchildren, transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.I've got the most comprehensive legislation in the Senate to do that. And as president, I will fight to make that happen. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~I think what we've got to do is move as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with Iran. Understanding that Iran's behavior in so many ways is something that we disagree with; their support terrorism, the anti-American rhetoric that we're hearing from of their leadership is something that is not acceptable.On the other hand, the fact that we've managed to reach an agreement, something that I've very strongly supported that prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and we did that without going to war. And that I believe we're seeing a fall in our relationships with Iran is a very positive step. So if your question is, do I want to see that relationship become more positive in the future? Yes.Can I tell that we should open an embassy in Tehran tomorrow? No, I don't think we should. But I think the goal has go to be as we've done with Cuba, to move in warm relations with a very powerful and important country in this world.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~I was asked a question.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~I was asked a question. You know, one of the things, Andrea, and I &mdash; that question annoys me. I cannot walk down the street &mdash; Secretary Clinton knows this &mdash; without being told how much I have to attack secretary Clinton, want to get me on the front pages of the paper, I'd make some vicious attack.I have avoided doing that. Trying to run an issue-oriented campaign. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~I was mayor for eight years, I did that as well. [laughter]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~If you want to
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Is that your strategy
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~It is &mdash; it is absolutely inaccurate.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Let me give you an example of how corrupt &mdash; how corrupt this system is. Goldman Sachs recently fined $5 billion. Goldman Sachs has given this country two secretaries of treasury, one on the Republicans, one under Democrats.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Let me just
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Let me just say that you might want to ask the governor of the state of Vermont why he could not do it. I'm not the governor. I'm the senator from the state of Vermont. [laughter]But second of all &mdash; second of all [applause]  here is what the real point is, in terms of all of the issues you've raised &mdash; the good questions you've raised. You know what it all comes down to?Do you know why we can't do what every other country &mdash; major country on Earth is doing? It's because we have a campaign finance system that is corrupt, we have super PACs, we have the pharmaceutical industry pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into campaign contributions and lobbying, and the private insurance companies as well.What this is really about is not the rational way to go forward &mdash; it's Medicare for all &mdash; it is whether we have the guts to stand up to the private insurance companies and all of their money, and the pharmaceutical industry. That's what this debate should be about. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Let me respond to what the secretary said. We have a criminal justice system which is broken. Who in America is satisfied that we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth, including China? Disproportionately African American, and Latino. Who is satisfied that 51% of African American young people are either unemployed, or underemployed? Who is satisfied that millions of people have police records for possessing marijuana when the CEO's of Wall Street companies who destroyed our economy have no police records. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~No one is tearing this up, we're going to go forward. But with the secretary neglected to mention, not just the 29 million still have no health insurance, that even more are underinsured with huge copayments and deductibles.Tell me why we are spending almost three times more than the British, who guarantee health care to all of their people? Fifty percent more than the French, more than the Canadians. The vision from FDR and Harry Truman was health care for all people as a right in a cost-effective way.We're not going to tear up the Affordable Care Act. I helped write it. But we are going to move on top of that to a Medicaid-for-all system.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~No, it is not breaking my word. When you are &mdash; it's one thing to say I'm raising taxes, it's another thing to say that we are doing away with private health insurance premiums.So, if I save you $10,000 in private health insurance, and you pay a little bit more in taxes in total, there are huge savings in what your family is spending.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~No. I think the vacuum was created by the disastrous war in Iraq, which I vigorously opposed. Not only did I vote against it, I helped lead the opposition. And what happened there is yes, it's easy to get rid of a two-bit dictator like Saddam Hussein, but there wasn't the kind of thought as to what happens the day after you get him and what kind of political vacuum occurs. And who rises up? Groups like ISIS.So I think that President Obama made a promise to the American people when he ran, and he said you know what, I'm going to do my best to bring American troops home. And I supported what he did. Our job is to train and provide military support for Muslim countries in the area who are prepared to take on ISIS.And one point I want to make here that is not made very often, you have incredibly wealthy countries in that region, countries like Saudi Arabia, countries like Qatar. Qatar happens to be the largest &mdash; wealthiest country per capita in the world. They have got to start putting in some skin in the game and not just ask the United States to do it. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Not all that detailed.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Nothing real will get happened. Unless we have a political revolution. Where millions of people finally stand up.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~OK.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~OK. First of all
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~OK. I just wanted to add, in the previous question, I voted against the USA Patriot Act for many of the reasons that Governor O'Malley mentioned. But it is not only the government that we have to worry about, it is private corporations.You would all be amazed, or maybe not, about the amount of information private companies and the government has in terms of the Web sites that you access, the products that you buy, where you are this very moment.And it is very clear to me that public policy has not caught up with the explosion of technology. So yes, we have to work with Silicon Valley to make sure that we do not allow ISIS to transmit information
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~OK. Let me suggest [crosstalk]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~OK. One &mdash; and I agree with what the secretary said, and what Governor O'Malley said. But here's an issue that we also should talk about. We have a $600 billion military budget. It is a budget larger than the next eight countries'.Unfortunately, much of that budget continues to fight the old Cold War with the Soviet Union. Very little of that budget &mdash; less than 10 percent &mdash; actually goes into fighting ISIS and international terrorism. We need to be thinking hard about making fundamental changes in the priorities of the Defense Department.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Right. What we have got to do there is, among other things, as I was just saying, have Silicon Valley help us to make sure that information being transmitted through the Internet or in other ways by ISIS is, in fact, discovered.But I do believe we can do that without violating the constitutional and privacy rights of the American people.[crosstalk]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Secretary &mdash; Secretary Clinton didn't answer your question. [laughter]Because what her campaign was saying &mdash; Bernie Sanders, who has fought for universal health care for my entire life, he wants to end Medicare, end Medicaid, end the children's health insurance program. That is nonsense.What a Medicare-for-all program does is finally provide in this country health care for every man, woman and child as a right. Now, the truth is, that Frank Delano Roosevelt, Harry Truman, do you know what they believed in? They believed that health care should be available to all of our people.I'm on the committee that wrote the Affordable Care Act. I made the Affordable Care Act along with Jim Clyburn a better piece of legislation. I voted for it, but right now, what we have to deal with is the fact that 29 million people still have no health insurance. We are paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, getting ripped off.And here's the important point, we are spending far more per person on health care than the people of any other country. My proposal, provide health care to all people, get private insurance out of health insurance, lower the cost of health care for middle class families by 5,000 bucks.That's the vision we need to take. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Set the record right. In 2006 when I ran for the Senate, Senator Barack Obama was kind enough to campaign for me, 2008, I did my best to see that he was elected and in 2012, I worked as hard as I could to see that he was reelected. He and I are friends. We've worked together on many issues. We have some differences of opinion.But here is the issue, Secretary touched on it, can you really reform Wall Street when they are spending millions and millions of dollars on campaign contributions and when they are providing speaker fees to individuals? So it's easy to say, well, I'm going to do this and do that, but I have doubts when people receive huge amounts of money from Wall Street.I am very proud, I do not have a super PAC. I do not want Wall Street's money. I'll rely on the middle class and working families
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Sure. I agree  [applause]I agree with everything the Secretary said, but let me just add this, there is a responsibility on the part of the pharmaceutical industry and the drug companies who are producing all of these drugs and not looking at the consequence of it.And second of all, when we talk about addiction being a disease, the Secretary is right, what that means is we need a revolution in this country in terms of mental health treatment. People should be able to get the treatment that they need when they need it, not two months from now, which is why I believe in universal
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Thank you. As we honor the extraordinary life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., it's important not only that we remember what he stood for, but that we pledge to continue his vision to transform our country. As we look out at our country today, what the American people understand is we have an economy that's rigged, that ordinary Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, 47 million people living in poverty, and almost all of the new income and wealth going to the top one percent.And then, to make a bad situation worse, we have a corrupt campaign finance system where millionaires and billionaires are spending extraordinary amounts of money to buy elections.This campaign is about a political revolution to not only elect the president, but to transform this country.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~That's true.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~The leader of Goldman Sachs is a billionaire who comes to Congress and tells us we should cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.Secretary Clinton &mdash; and you're not the only one, so I don't mean to just point the finger at you, you've received over $600,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs in one year.I find it very strange that a major financial institution that pays $5 billion in fines for breaking the law, not one of their executives is prosecuted, while kids who smoke marijuana get a jail sentence. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~The point is, we have to make Congress respond to the needs of the people, not big money.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~we have documented, unlike Secretary Clinton, I have documented exactly how I would pay for our ambitious agenda.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~We need to expand what the input into the Democratic party. I am very proud that in this campaign, we have seen an enormous amount of excitement from young people, from working people. We have received more individual contributions than any candidate in the history of this country up to this point. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~We need to take a very hard look at our
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~We should &mdash; we should learn &mdash; we should learn from King Abdullah of Jordan, one of the few heroes in a very unheroic place. And what Abdullah said is this is a war with a soul of Islam and that Muslim troops should be on the ground with our support and the support of other major countries. That is how we destroy ISIS, not with American troops in perpetual warfare.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Well &mdash; then if I don't answer it, then there's another front page, so it's yes. [laughter]And I mean this seriously. You know that. We've been through this. Yes, his behavior was deplorable. Have I ever once said a word about that issue? No, I have not. I'm going to debate Secretary Clinton, Governor O'Malley, on the issues facing the American people, not Bill Clinton's personal behavior. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Well, I &mdash; look
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Well, I think Secretary Clinton knows that what she says is very disingenuous. I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA. I was in 1988, there were three candidates running for congress in the state of Vermont, I stood up to the gun lobby and came out and maintained the position that in this country we should not be selling military style assault weapons.I have supported from day one and instant background check to make certain that people who should have guns do not have guns. And that includes people of criminal backgrounds, people who are mentally unstable. I support what President Obama is doing in terms of trying to close the gun show loop holes and I think it should be a federal crime if people act as dormant.We have seen in this city a horrendous tragedy of a crazed person praying with people in the coming up and shooting nine people. This should not be a political issue. What we should be doing is working together.And by the way, as a senator from a rural state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in an excellent position to bring people together to fight the sensible
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Well, let me talk about polling. [laughter] As Secretary Clinton well knows, when this campaign began she was 50 points ahead of me. We were all of three percentage points. Guess what?In Iowa, New Hampshire, the race is very, very close. Maybe we're ahead New Hampshire. [cheering]In terms of polling, guess what? We are running ahead of Secretary Clinton. In terms of taking on my taking on my good friend, Donald Trump, beating him by 19 points in New Hampshire, 13 points in the last national poll that we saw.To answer your question. When the African American community becomes familiar with my Congressional record and with our agenda, and with our views on the economy, and criminal justice &mdash; just as the general population has become more supportive, so will the African American community, so will the Latino community. We have the momentum, we're on a path to a victory. [applause and cheering]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Well, Secretary Clinton was right and what I did which I think is also right, is demanded the resignation of governor. A man who acts that irresponsibly should not stay in power.Now, we are a great nation &mdash; and we've heard a lot of great ideas here tonight. Let's be honest and let's be truthful. Very little is going to be done to transform our economy and to create the kind of middle class we need unless we end a corrupt campaign finance system which is undermining American democracy.We've got to get rid of Super PACs, we've got to get rid of Citizens' United and what we've got to do is create a political revolution which revitalizes American democracy; which brings millions of young people and working people into the political process. To say loudly and clearly," that the government of the United States of America belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors."
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Well, that's &mdash; you might want to ask
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Well, that's what our campaign is about. It is thinking big. It is understanding that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, we should have health care for every man, woman, and child as a right that we should raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour; that we have got to create millions of decent- paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure.So, what my first days are about is bringing America together, to end the decline of the middle class, to tell the wealthiest people in this country that yes, they are going to start paying their fair share of taxes, and that we are going to have a government that works for all of us, and not just big campaign contributors. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Well, the first difference is I don't take money from big banks. I don't get personal speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. What I would do  [applause]What I would do is understand that when you have three out of the four largest banks today, bigger than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have the six largest financial institutions having assets of 60 percent of the GDP of America, it is very clear to me what you have to do.You've got to bring back the 21st century Glass-Steagall legislation and you've got to break up these huge financial institutions. They have too much economic power and they have too much financial power over our entire economy. If Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, the old Republican trust buster, what he would say is these guys are too powerful. Break them up. I believe that's what the American people to want see. That's my view.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Well.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~What I have said, is that gun manufacturer's liability bill has some good provisions among other things, we've prohibited ammunition that would've killed cops who had protection on. We have child safety protection work on guns in that legislation. And what we also said, "is a small mom and pop gun shop who sells a gun legally to somebody should not be held liable if somebody does something terrible with that gun."So what I said is, " I would re-look at it." We are going to re- look at it and I will support stronger provisions.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~What is correct, and I'm disappointed that Secretary Clinton's campaign has made this criticism. It's a Republican criticism. Secretary Clinton does know a lot about healthcare, and she understands, I believe, that a medicare for all, single payer program will substantially lower the cost of healthcare for middle class families. So, what we have got to acknowledge, and I hope the Secretary does, is we are doing away with private health insurance premiums.So, instead of paying $10,000 dollars to Blue Cross, or Blue Shield, yes, some middle class families would be paying slightly more in taxes, but the result would be that that middle class family would be saving some $5,000 dollars in healthcare costs. A little bit more in taxes, do away with private health insurance premiums. It's a pretty good deal. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Where Secretary Clinton and I think, I agree with most of what she said. But where I think we do have an honest disagreement, is that in the incredible quagmire of Syria, where it's hard to know who's fighting who and if you give arms to this guy, it may end up in ISIS' hand the next day. We all know that.And we all know, no argument, the secretary is absolutely right, Assad is a butcher of his own people, man using chemical weapons against his own people. This is beyond disgusting.But I think in terms of our priorities in the region, our first priority must be the destruction of ISIS. Our second priority must be getting rid of Assad, through some political settlement, working with Iran, working with Russia.But the immediate task is to bring all interests together who want to destroy ISIS, including Russia, including Iran, including our Muslim allies to make that the major priority.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~who control economic and political life of this country.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Yeah
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Yeah.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Yes.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~a growing epidemic.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Absolutely not.I have a three point plan that does not include American Ground forces. It includes the United States leading an air coalition which is what we're doing, supporting fighters on the ground; the Iraqi Army which is beginning to show more ability, the Sunni fighters that we are now helping to reconstitute and Kurdish on both sides of the border.I think we also have try to disrupt their supply chain of foreign fighters and foreign money and we do have to contest them in online space. So I'm very committed to both going after ISIS but also supporting what Secretary Kerry is doing to try to move on a political diplomatic to try to begin to slow down and hopefully end the carnage in Syria which is the root of so many of the problems that we seen in the region and beyond.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~and go after ISIS, which I don't think would be a good idea.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~And let me
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~And that's exactly what we are able to do based on the foundation of the Affordable Care Act &mdash; what Governor O'Malley just said is one of the models that we will be looking at to make sure we do get costs down, we do limit a lot of the unnecessary costs that we still have in the system.But, with all due respect, to start over again with a whole new debate is something that I think would set us back. The Republicans just voted last week to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and thank goodness, President Obama vetoed it and saved Obamacare for the American people. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~And you were
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~both the governor and the senator have focused only on the big banks. Lehman Brothers, AIG, the shadow banking sector were as big a problem in what caused the Great Recession, I go after them.And I can tell you that the hedge fund billionaires who are running ads against me right now, and Karl Rove, who started running an ad against me right now, funded by money from the financial services sector, sure thing, I'm the one they don't want to be up against. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~But &mdash; Senator Sanders, if I can  [applause]You know, I have to say I'm not sure whether we're talking about the plan you just introduced tonight, or we're talking about the plan you introduced nine times in the Congress. But the fact is, we have the Affordable Care Act. That is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country. [applause]And we have already seen 19 million Americans get insurance. We have seen the end of pre-existing conditions keeping people from getting insurance. [applause]We have seen women no longer paying more for our insurance than men. And we have seen young people, up to the age of 26, being able to stay on their parent's policy.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~But I will tell you exactly how I pay for everything I've proposed [crosstalk]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~but it goes much further, because
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~But overall, a lot of the forces at work in the region are ones that we cannot directly influence, but we can
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~I think, as commander in chief, you've got to constantly be evaluating the decisions you have to make. I know a little bit about this, having spent many hours in the situation room, advising President Obama.And I want to just add to something that Senator Sanders said, the United States had a very big interest in trying to help stabilize the region. If there is any blame to be spread around, it starts with the prime minister of Iraq, who sectarianized his military, setting Shia against Sunni.It is amplified by Assad, who has waged one of the bloodiest, most terrible attacks on his own people: 250,000-plus dead, millions fleeing. Causing this vacuum that has been filled unfortunately, by terrorist groups, including ISIS.So, I think we are in the midst of great turmoil in this region. We have a proxy conflict going on between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, one of the criticisms I've had of Senator Sanders is his suggestion that, you know, Iranian troops be used to try to end the war in Syria
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~I want to be a president who takes care of the big problems and the problems that are affecting the people of our country everyday. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~I would work quickly to present to the Congress my plans for creating more good jobs in manufacturing, infrastructure, clean and renewable energy, raising the minimum wage, and guaranteeing, finally, equal pay for women's work.I would also [applause] I would also be presenting my plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and to improve it by decreasing the out-of-pocket costs by putting a cap on prescription drug costs; by looking for ways that we can put the prescription drug business and the health insurance company business on a more stable platform that doesn't take too much money out of the pockets of hard-working Americans.And third, I would be working, in every way that I knew, to bring our country together. We do have too much division, too much mean- spiritedness. There's a lot we have to do on immigration reform, on voting rights, on campaign finance reform, but we need to do it together. That's how we'll have the kind of country for the 21st century that we know will guarantee our children and grandchildren the kind of future they deserve. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~It builds on the Dodd-Frank &mdash; yes, it is. It builds on the Dodd-Frank, regulatory scheme
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Look, I have the greatest respect for Senator Sanders and for his supports and I'm going to keep working as hard as I can to reach as many people of all ages about what I will do, what the experience and the ideas that I have that I will bring to the White House and I hope to have their support when I'm the Democratic nominee.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Look, I think that the president's decision to go after the chemical weapons once there was a potential opportunity to build on when the Russians opened that door resulted in a very positive outcome. We were able to get the chemical weapons out.I know from my own experience as secretary of State that we were deeply worried about Assad's forces using chemical weapons because it would have had not only a horrific affect on people in Syria, but it could very well have affected the surrounding states, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Turkey. So getting those chemical weapons out was a big deal, but
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Now, there are things we can do to improve it, but to tear it up and start over again, pushing our country back into that kind of a contentious debate, I think is the wrong direction.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Oh, we're breaking? OK.[commercial break]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~So this is the kind of approach that we should take in dealing with what is now
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~That is not what I've heard. Let me leave it at that.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~That pose a risk to the financial sector. I want to go further and add to that.And, you know, Governor, you have raised money on Wall Street. You raised a lot of money on Wall Street when you were the head of the Democratic Governor's Association
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~That turning over our White House to the Republicans would be bad for everybody especially young people.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~The Republicans want to give them more power, and repeal Dodd-Frank. That's what we need to stop  [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~There's plenty of problems that we all have to face together.And the final thing I would say, we're at least having a vigorous debate about reining in Wall Street
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Well &mdash; but &mdash; but
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Well Lester, I spent a lot of time last week being outraged by what's happening in Flint, Michigan and I think every single American should be outraged. We've had a city in the United States of America where the population which is poor in many ways and majority African American has been drinking and bathing in lead contaminated water. And the governor of that state acted as though he didn't really care.He had request for help and he had basically stone walled. I'll tell you what, if the kids in a rich suburb of Detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it, there would've been action.So I sent my top campaign aide down there to talk to the mayor of Flint to see what I could to help. I issued a statement about what we needed to do and then I went on a T.V. show and I said, "it was outrageous that the governor hadn't acted and within two hours he had."
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Well thanks for the question and congratulations on five million viewers on YouTube, that's quite an accomplishment. Look, this election is mostly about the future and therefore it is of greatest urgency for young people.I've laid out my ideas about what we can do to make college affordable; how we can help people pay off their student debts and save thousands of dollars, how we can create more good jobs because a lot of the young people that I talk with are pretty disappointed the economic prospects they feel their facing. So making community college free, making it possible to attend a public college or university with debt free tuition, looking for ways to protect our rights especially from the concerted Republican assault; on voting rights, on women's rights, on gay rights, on civil rights, on workers rights.And I know how much young people value their independence, their autonomy, and their rights. So I think this is an election where we have to pull young people and older people together to have a strategy about how we're going to encourage even more American's to vote because it absolutely clear to me
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Well, Andrea, I am absolutely committed to universal health care. I have worked on this for a long time, people may remember that I took on the health insurance industry back in the '90s, and I didn't quit until we got the children's health insurance program that ensures eight million kids.And I certainly respect Senator Sanders' intentions, but when you're talking about health care, the details really matter. And therefore, we have been raising questions about the nine bills that he introduced over 20 years, as to how they would work and what would be the impact on people's health care?He didn't like that, his campaign didn't like it either. And tonight, he's come out with a new health care plan. And again, we need to get into the details. But here's what I believe, the Democratic Party and the United States worked since Harry Truman to get the Affordable Care Act passed.We finally have a path to universal health care. We have accomplished so much already. I do not to want see the Republicans repeal it, and I don't to want see us start over again with a contentious debate. I want us to defend and build on the Affordable Care Act and improve it. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Well, as someone who &mdash; as someone who has a little bit of experience standing up to the health insurance industry, that spent, you know [applause] many, many millions of dollars attacking me, and probably will so again, because of what I believe we can do building on the Affordable Care Act, I think it's important to point out that there are a lot of reasons we have the health care system we have today.I know how much money influences the political decision-making. That's why I'm for huge campaign finance reform. However, we started a system that had private health insurance.And even during the Affordable Care Act debate, there was an opportunity to vote for what was called the public option. In other words, people could buy in to Medicare, and even when the Democrats were in charge of the Congress, we couldn't get the votes for that.So, what I'm saying is really simple. This has been the fight of the Democratic Party for decades. We have the Affordable Care Act. Let's make it work.Let's take the models that states are doing. We now have driven costs down to the lowest they've been in 50 years. Now we've got to get individual costs down. That's what I'm planning to do.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Well, good evening. And I want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and the people of Charleston for hosting us here on the eve of Martin Luther King Day tomorrow.You know, I remember well when my youth minister took me to hear Dr. King. I was a teenager. And his moral clarity, the message that he conveyed that evening really stayed with me and helped to set me on a path to service. I also remember that he spent the last day of his life in Memphis, fighting for dignity and higher pay for working people.And that is our fight still. We have to get the economy working and incomes rising for everyone, including those who have been left out and left behind. We have to keep our communities and our country safe. We need a president who can do all aspects of the job.I understand that this is the hardest job in the world. I'm prepared and ready to take it on and I hope to earn your support to be the nominee of the Democratic Party and the next president of the United States. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Well, I'm very proud of the Iran Nuclear Agreement. I was very pleased to be part of what the president put into action when he took office. I was responsible for getting those sanctions imposed which put the pressure on Iran. It brought them to the negotiating table which resulted in this agreement.And so, they have been so far, following their requirements under the agreement. But I think we still have to carefully watch them. We've had one good day over 36 year and I think we need more good days before we move more rapidly toward any kind of normalization. And we have to be sure that they are truly going to implement the agreement. And then, we have to go after them on a lot of their other bad behavior in the region which is causing enormous problems in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and elsewhere.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Well, I have actually documented every way that I'm going to pay for what I'm doing because I think the American public deserves to know. And, you can go to my website and actually see that.But, there are serious questions about how we're going to pay for what we want to see our country do. And, I'm the only candidate standing here tonight who has said I will not raise taxes on the middle class. I want to raise incomes, not taxes, and I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that the wealthy pay for debt free tuition, for child care, for paid family leave. To help us bring down student debt we're going to refinance that student debt, saving kids thousands of dollars.Yeah, and that will also come out of the &mdash; some of the pockets of people in the financial services industry
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Well, I think it's an important point the president made in his State of the Union. And here's what I would say. I will go anywhere, to meet with anyone, at any time to find common ground.That's what I did as a first lady, when I worked with both Democrats and Republicans to get the Children's Health Insurance Program, when I worked with Tom DeLay, one of the most partisan of Republicans, to reform the adoption and foster care system.What I did, working in the Senate, where I crossed the aisle often, working even with the senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, to get Tricare for national guardsmen and women.And it's what I did as Secretary of State, on numerous occasions, and most particularly, rounding up two-thirds votes in order to pass a treaty that lowered the nuclear weapons in both Russia and the United States.So I know it's hard, but I also know you've got to work at it every single day. I look out here, I see a lot of my friends from the Congress. And I know that they work at it every single day.Because maybe you can't only find a little sliver of common ground to cooperate with somebody from the other party, but who knows. If you're successful there, maybe you can build even more. That's what I would do.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Well, I wanted to say, and I'll do it quickly, I was very pleased that leaders of President Obama's administration went out to Silicon Valley last week and began exactly this conversation about what we can do, consistent with privacy and security.We need better intelligence cooperation, we need to be sure that we are getting the best intelligence that we can from friends and allies around the world. And then, we've got to recognize our first line of defense against lone wolf attacks is among Muslim Americans.And it is not only shameful, it is dangerous for the kinds of comments you're hearing from the Republican side.We need to be reaching out and unifying our country against terrorist attacks and lone wolves, and working with Muslim Americans. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Well, it'll start at the kitchen table, we'll see how it goes from there. And I [applause] I'm going to have the very best advisers that I can possibly have, and when it comes to the economy and what was accomplished under my husband's leadership and the '90s &mdash; especially when it came to raising incomes for everybody and lifting more people out of poverty than at any time in recent history &mdash; you bet.I'm going to ask for his ideas, I'm going ask for his advice, and I'm going use him as a goodwill emissary to go around the country to find the best ideas we've got, because I do believe, as he said, everything that's wrong with America has been solved somewhere in America.We just have to do more of it, and we have to reach out, especially into poor communities and communities of color, to give more people their own chance to get ahead.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Well, it would depend on what I got for it and I can tell you what we got in the first term, we got a new start treaty to reduce nuclear weapons between the United States and Russia. We got permission to resupply our troops in Afghanistan by traveling across Russia.We got Russia to sign on to our sanctions against Iran and other very important commitments. So look, in diplomacy, you are always trying to see how you can figure out the interest of the other to see if there isn't some way you can advance your security and your values.When Putin came back in the fall of 2011, it was very clear he came back with a mission. And I began speaking out as soon as that happened because there were some fraudulent elections held, and Russians poured out into the streets to demand their freedom, and he cracked down. And in fact, accused me of fomenting it. So we now know that he has a mixed record to say the least and we have to figure out how to deal with him.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Well, Lester, you're right. Everywhere I go to campaign, I'm meeting families who are affected by the drug problem that mostly is opioids and heroin now, and lives are being lost and children are being orphaned. And I've met a lot of grandparents who are now taking care of grandchildren.So I have tried to come out with a comprehensive approach that, number one, does tell the states that we will work with you from the federal government putting more money, about a billion dollars a year, to help states have a different approach to dealing with this epidemic.The policing needs to change. Police officers must be equipped with the antidote to a heroin overdose or an opioid overdose, known as Narcan. They should be able to administer it. So should firefighters and others.We have to move away from treating the use of drugs as a crime and instead, move it to where it belongs, as a health issue. And we need to divert more people from the criminal justice system into drug courts, into treatment, and recovery.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Well, my relationship with him, it's &mdash; it's interesting. [laughter]It's one, I think, of respect. We've had some very tough dealings with one another. And I know that he's someone that you have to continuingly stand up to because, like many bullies, he is somebody who will take as much as he possibly can unless you do.And we need to get the Europeans to be more willing to stand up, I was pleased they put sanctions on after Crimea and eastern Ukraine and the downing of the airliner, but we've got to be more united in preventing Putin from taking a more aggressive stance in Europe and the Middle East. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Well, sadly it's reality, and it has been heartbreaking, and incredibly outraging to see the constant stories of young men like Walter Scott, as you said, who have been killed by police officers. Their needs to be a concerted effort to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.And, that requires a very clear, agenda for retraining police officers, looking at ways to end racial profiling, finding more ways to really bring the disparities that stalk our country into high relief.One out of three African American men may well end up going to prison. That's the statistic. I want people hear to think what we would be doing if it was one out of three white men, and very often, the black men are arrested, convicted and incarcerated  [applause] for offensive that do not lead to the same results for white men.So, we have a very serious problem that we can no longer ignore.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Well, the last point on this is, Senator Sanders, you're the only one on this stage that voted to deregulate the financial market in 2000, to take the cops off the street, to use Governor O'Malley's phrase, to make the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission no longer able to regulate swaps and derivatives, which were one of the main cause of the collapse in '08.So there's plenty
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Well, there's no daylight on the basic premise that there should be no bank too big to fail and no individual too powerful to jail. We agree on that. But where we disagree is the comments that Senator Sanders has made that don't just affect me, I can take that, but he's criticized President Obama for taking donations from Wall Street, and President Obama has led our country out of the great recession. Senator Sanders called him weak, disappointing. He even, in 2011, publicly sought someone to run in a primary against President Obama. Now, I personally believe that President Obama's work to push through the Dodd-Frank  [laughter]The Dodd-Frank bill and then to sign it was one of the most important regulatory schemes we've had since the 1930s. So I'm going to defend Dodd-Frank and I'm going to defend President Obama for taking on Wall Street, taking on the financial industry and getting results. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Yes look, I have made it clear based on Senator Sanders' own record that he has voted with the NRA, with the gun lobby numerous times. He voted against the Brady Bill five times. He voted for what we call, the Charleston Loophole. He voted for immunity from gunmakers and sellers which the NRA said, "was the most important piece of gun legislation in 20 years. "He voted to let guns go onto the Amtrak, guns go into National Parks. He voted against doing research to figure out how we can save lives. Let's not forget what this is about, 90 people a day die from gun violence in our country. That's 33,000 people a year.One of the most horrific examples not a block from here where we had nine people murdered. Now, I am pleased to hear that Senator Sanders has reversed his position on immunity and I look forward to him joining with those members of congress who have already introduced legislation. There is no other industry in America that was given the total pass that the gun makers and dealers were and that needs to be reversed.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Yes, well, first of all &mdash; first of all, Paul Krugman, Barney Frank, others have all endorsed my plan. Secondly, we have Dodd-Frank. It gives us the authority already to break up big banks that pose
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Yes, well, the point is that if we're going to be serious about this and not just try to score political points, we should know what's in Dodd-Frank, and what's in Dodd-Frank already gives the president the authority [crosstalk] with his regulators to make those decisions.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~You know, I think since &mdash; since Senator Standers followed up on this
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Your profusion of comments about your feelings towards President Obama are a little strange given what you said about him in 2011.But look, I have a plan that most commentators have said is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~[inaudible]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~And Andrea &mdash; Andrea &mdash; Andrea
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~and to do more of them to reform our criminal justice system.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~And we have never used it.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Andrea
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Andrea &mdash; Andrea &mdash; Andrea.[crosstalk] [applause]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Andrea, I need to talk about homeland security and preparedness.Ever since the attacks of September 11th &mdash; 30 seconds. [laughter]Ever since the attacks of September 11th, my colleagues, Democratic and Republican mayors, Democratic and Republican governors, made me their leader on homeland security and preparedness.Here in the homeland, unlike combating ISIL abroad, we're almost like it's &mdash; your body's immune system. It's able to protect your body against bad bugs, not necessarily because it outnumbers them, but it's better connected &mdash; the fusion centers, the biosurveillance systems, better prepared first responders.But there's another front in this battle, and it is this. That's the political front, and if Donald Trump wants to start a registry in our country of people by faith, he can start with me, and I will sign up as one who is totally opposed to his fascist appeals that wants to vilify American Muslims. That can do more damage to our democracy than any [crosstalk]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Andrea, when can I get my 30 seconds?
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~But in all of that senator and secretary, I think we're leaving out something very important here. And that is that we still don't have the human intelligence: overt, in terms of diplomatic intelligence or covert, to understand even what the heck happens as the secondary and tertiary effects of some of these things.We are walking through this region, Andrea, without the human intelligence that we need. And we need to make a renewed investment as a country in bringing up a new generation of foreign service officers, and bringing up a new generation of business people and actually understanding and having relationships in these places.So we have a better sense of what the heck happens after a dictator topples and can take action to prevent another safe haven and another iteration of terror.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Can I get 30 seconds, too? [laughter]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Finally &mdash; I'm sorry, that was second, Lester.And third and finally, we need a new agenda for America's cities. We have not had a new agenda for America's cities since Jimmy Carter. We need a new agenda for America cities that will invest in the talents and skills in our people, that will invest in CBVG transportation, infrastructure and transit options, and make our cities the leading edge in this move to a redesigned built clean green energy future that will employ our people.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Great question.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~I agree with that.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~I agree.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~I believe there are many issues. I have 60 seconds for this?
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~I have to talk about something that's actually working in our state.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Instead of &mdash; Andrea, I think, instead of attacking one another on health care, we should be talking about the things that are actually working.In our state, we have moved to an all-payer system. With the Affordable Care Act, we now have moved all of our acute care hospitals, that driver of cost at the center, away from fee-for- service.And actually to pay, we pay them based on how well they keep patients out of the hospital. How well they keep their patients. That's the future. We need to build on the Affordable Care Act, do the things that work, and reduce costs and increase access.[crosstalk]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~It's just not true.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Just 10 seconds. All of the things
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Lester, I [inaudible]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Lester, just ten seconds.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Oh, come on.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~OK. So, that was eight years. Yes. And Senator, but I actually did it during a budget down time &mdash; I mean, during a recession.And Andrea, the &mdash; I had to make more cuts than any governor in the history of Maryland, but we invested more in infrastructure, more in transportation. We made our public schools more in America more than five years in a row, and went four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.The things that we need to do in our country, like debt-free college in the next five years, like making universal &mdash; like making national service a universal option in order to cut youth unemployment in half in the next three years, all these things can be done if we eliminate one entitlement we can no longer afford as a nation.And that is the wealthy among us, those making more than a million dollars, feel that they are entitled to paying a much lower marginal tax rate than was usual for the better part of these 80 years.And if we tax earnings from investments on money &mdash; namely capital gains &mdash; at the same rate as we tax sweat and hard work and toil, we can make the investments we need to make to make our country better.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Say it.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Senator, I'm the only person on this stage that's actually balanced a budget every year for 15 years.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~so somebody please, go on to martinomalley.com [laughter]. Go on to martinomalley.com, send me your checks. They're not giving me &mdash; zero.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Thank you. [applause]Andrea, governors have led us to victory in two world wars by doing what America does best, and that is by joining forces with others by acting in coalition. And I believe that President Obama is doing the right thing in this case.We need to learn the lessons from the past. We do need to provide the special &mdash; special ops advisers, we need &mdash; do need to provide the technical support, but over the long-term, we need to develop new alliances. We need a much more proactive national security strategy that reduces these threats before they rise to a level where it feels like we need to pull for a division of marines.And I also want to add one other thing here. I appreciate the fact that in our debate, we don't use the term you hear Republicans throwing around trying to look all vibrato and macho sending other kids &mdash; kids into combat, they keep using the term boots on the ground. A woman in Burlington, Iowa said to me, "Governor, when you're with your colleagues, please don't refer to my son who has served two tours of duty in Iraq as a pair of boots on the ground." Now, we need to be mindful of learning the lessons of the past. [applause]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Thank you. First of all, I would lay out an agenda to make wages go up again for all Americans, rather than down. Equal pay for equal work, making it easier rather than harder for people to join labor unions and bargain collectively for better wages; getting 11 million of our neighbors out of the underground shadow economy by passing comprehensive immigration reform, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, however we can, wherever we can.Secondly, I believe the greatest business opportunity to come to the United States of America in 100 years is climate change. And I put forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050 and create 5 million jobs along the way. [applause]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Thank you. My name is Martin O'Malley, I was born the year Dr. King delivered his "I Have A Dream" speech.And I want to thank the people of South Carolina, not only for hosting our debate here tonight, but also for what you taught all of us in the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Mother Emanuel Church.You taught us, in fact, in keeping with Dr. King's teaching, that love would have the final word when you took down the Confederate flag from your state house; let go of the past and move forward.Eight years ago, you brought forward a new leader in Barack Obama to save our country from the second Great Depression. And that's what he's done. Our country's doing better, we're creating jobs again.But in order to make good on the promise of equal opportunity and equal justice under the law, and we have urgent work to do, and the voices of anger and fear and division that we've heard coming off of the Republican presidential podiums are pretty loud.We need new leadership. We need to come together as a people and build on the good things that President Obama has done.That's why I'm running for president. I need your help, I ask for your vote, and I look forward to moving our country forward once again.Thank you.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Thank you.I believe whether it's a back door or a front door that the American principle of law should still hold that our federal government should have to get a warrant, whether they want to come through the back door or your front door. [applause]And I also agree, Lester, with Benjamin Franklin, who said, no people should ever give up their privacy or their freedoms in a promise for security.So we're a collaborative people. We need collaborative leadership here with Silicon Valley and other bright people in my own state of Maryland and around the NSA that can actually figure this out.But there are certain immutable principles that will not become antique things in our country so long as we defend our country and its values and its freedoms. And one of those things is our right to be secure in our homes, and our right to expect that our federal government should have to get a warrant.I also want to the say that while we've made some progress on the Patriot Act, I do believe that we need an adversarial court system there. We need a public advocate. We need to develop jurisprudence so that we can develop a body of law that protects the privacy of Americans in the information and digital age.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Thank you.Lester, on this stage tonight, this Democratic stage, where we actually believe in science. [laughter]I would like to challenge and invite my colleagues here on this stage to join me in putting forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean, electric energy grid by 2050. It can be done. [applause]With solar, with wind, with new technologies, with green buildings, this can happen, but in all &mdash; President Obama made us more energy independent, but in all of the above strategy didn't land us on the moon, we need American ingenuity and we need to reach by 2050 for the sake of our kids.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Thanks a lot.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~That's not true.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~The only person on this stage who has
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~There are so many issues that we haven't been able to discuss here. We have not fully discussed immigration reform, and the deplorable number of immigrant detention camps that our nation's now maintaining. We haven't discussed the shameful treatment that the people of Puerto Rico, our fellow Americans, are getting treated with by these hedge funds that are working them over. [applause]We haven't discussed the fact that in our hemisphere we have the danger of nation-state failures because of drug traffickers; and Honduras, and Guatemala and El Salvador.I guess the bottom line is this, look we are a great people the way we act at home and abroad based on the beliefs that unite us. Our belief in the dignity of every person, our belief in our own common good. There is now challenge that is too great for us to overcome provided we bring forward in these divided times, new leadership that can heal our divides here at home and bring our principles into alignment abroad.We're on the threshold of a new era of American progress and I believe we have only need to join forces together and cross that threshold into a new era of American prosperity.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~This is what I would say Lester, look see, I've listened to Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders go back and forth on which of them has the most inconsistent record on gun safety legislation and I would have to agree with both of them. They've both been inconsistent when it comes to this issue.I'm the one candidate on this stage that actually brought people together to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation. This is very personal to me being from Baltimore. I will never forget one occasion visiting a little boy in Johns' Hopkins Hospital, he was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery and that boy's head was pierced with a bullet. And I remember visiting him, it did not kill him - I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital. He was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery, and that boys head was pierced with a bullet.And, I remember visiting him, it did not kill him. I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital. In his diapers with tubes running in and out of his head, same age as my little boy.So, after the slaughter of the kids in Connecticut last year, we brought people together. We did pass in our state comprehensive gun safety legislation. It did have a ban on combat assault weapons, universal background checks, and you know what? We did not interrupt a single person's hunting season.I've never met a self respecting deer hunter that needed an AR-15 to down a deer. And, so [applause] we're able to actually do these things.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Yes, but I haven't gotten a penny this year
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Yes, but senator you never came to campaign for Vincent Sheheen when he was running for governor. In fact, neither of you came to campaign for Vincent Sheheen when he was running for governor. [applause]We can talk all we want about wanting to build a stronger Democratic party, but Lester, the question you answered, it's no laughing matter.The most recurring question I get when I stand on the chair all across Iowa and talk with my neighbors is, how are you going to heal the divisions and the wounds in our country? This is the biggest challenge we face as a people.All my life, I brought people together over deep divides and very old wounds, and that's what we need now in a new leader. We cannot keep talking past each other, declaring all Republicans are our enemies or the war is all about being against millionaires or billionaires, or it's all against American Muslims, all against immigrants.Look, as Frederick Douglas said, we are one, our cause is one, and we must help each other if we are going to succeed.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Yes, but we're going to have to get 20 minutes to do it, so. [laughter]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Yes, Lester, year in and year out I was the leader of the U.S.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Yes, let's talk about this. When I ran for mayor in 1999, Lester, it was not because our city was doing well. It was because we were burying over 300 young, poor black men every single year.And that's why I ran, because, yes, black lives matter. And we did a number of things. We weren't able to make our city immune from setbacks as the Freddie Gray unrest and tragic death showed.But we were able to save a lot of lives doing things that actually worked to improve police and community relations. The truth of the matter is, we created a civilian review board. And many of these things are in the new agenda for criminal justice reform that I've put forward.We created a civilian review board, gave them their own detectives. We required the reporting of discourtesy, use of excessive force, lethal force. I repealed the possession of marijuana as a crime in our state.I drove our incarceration rate down to 20-year lows, and drove violent crime down to 30-year lows, and became the first governor south of the Mason-Dixon line to repeal the death penalty.I feel a responsibility every day to find things that work  [applause]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina~January 17, 2016~Yes, thank you. Yes, Lester, what Secretary Clinton just said is actually not true. What &mdash; I have put forward a plan that would actually put cops back on the beat of Wall Street. I have put forward a plan that was heralded as very comprehensive and realistic.Look, if a bank robber robs a bank and all you do is slap him on the wrist, he's just going to keep robbing banks again. The same thing is true with people in suits.Secretary Clinton, I have a tremendous amount of respect for you, but for you to say there's no daylight on this between the three of us is also not true. I support reinstituting a modern version of Glass- Steagall that would include going after the shadow banks, requiring capital requirements that would force them to no longer put us on the hook for these sorts of things.In prior debates I've heard you even bring up &mdash; I mean, now you bring up President Obama here in South Carolina in defense of the fact of your cozy relationship with Wall Street.In an earlier debate, I heard you bring up even the 9/11 victims to defend it. The truth of the matter is, Secretary Clinton, you do not go as far as reining in Wall Street as I would.And the fact of the matter is, the people of America deserve to have a president that's on their side, protecting the main street economy from excesses on Wall Street. And we're just as vulnerable today.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Absolutely.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Absolutely. In fact, climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism. And if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say, you're going to see countries all over the world -- this is what the CIA says -- they're going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops ask you're going to see all kinds of international conflict. But, of course, international terrorism is a major issue that we have got to address today. And I agree with much of what the Secretary and the Governor have said. But let me have one area of disagreement with the Secretary. I think she said something like the bulk of the responsibility is not ours. Well, in fact, I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, has unraveled the region completely and led to the rise of al-Qaeda and to ISIS. Now, in fact, what we have got to do -- and I think there is widespread agreement here -- is the United States cannot do it alone. What we need to do is lead an international coalition which includes very significantly the Muslim nations in that region who are going to have to fight and defend their way of life.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~And that I am not a great fan of regime change.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~And we are going to do a political revolution, which brings working people, young people, senior citizens, minorities together. Because every issue that I am talking about-- paid family and medical leave, breaking up the banks on Wall Street, asking the wealth to pay their fair share of taxes, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour -- every one of those issues is supported by a significant majority of the American people. The problem is, that as a result of a corrupt campaign finance system, Congress is not listening to the American people. Its listening to the big money interest. What the political revolution is about is bringing people together to finally say, enough is enough. This government belongs to us. Not just the billionaires.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~I am on the committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act. We have made some good progress. Now what we have to take on is the pharmaceutical industry that is ripping off the American people every single day. I am proud that I was the first member of Congress to take Americans over the Canadian border to buy breast cancer drugs for one-tenth the price they were paying in the United States. But at the end of the day, no doubt, the Affordable Care Act is a step forward. I think we all support it. I believe we've got to go further. I want to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege. [applause] And also -- also, what we should be clear about is we end up spending -- and I think the secretary knows this -- far more per capita on health care than any other major country, and our outcomes, health care outcomes are not necessarily that good.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~I don't know and with all due respect to the secretary, Wall Street played by the rules? Who are we kidding? The business model of Wall Street is fraud. That's what it is. [applause] And we have -- and let me make this promise. One of the problems we have had -- I think all Americans understand this, is whether it's Republican administrations or Democratic administrations, we have seen Wall Street and Goldman Sachs dominate administrations. Here's my promise-- Wall Street representatives will not be in my cabinet. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~I don't think any -- I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now. I think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the more than history of the United States.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~I don't think the term is what's important. What is important to understand is we have organizations, whether it is ISIS or Al Qaida, who do believe we should go back several thousand years. We should make women third-class citizens, that we should allow children to be sexually assaulted, that they are a danger to modern society. And that this world, with American leadership, can and must come together to destroy them. We can do that. And it requires an entire world to come together, including in a very active way, the Muslim nations.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~I have never heard a candidate never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me. I'm going to be independent. Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? they expect to get something. Everybody knows that. Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate. We are relying on small campaign donors, 750,000 of them, 30 bucks a piece. That's who I'm indebted to.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~I think we have a disagreement, and the disagreement is that not only did I vote against the war in Iraq. If you look at history, John, you will find that regime change -- whether it was in the early '50s in Iran, whether it was toppling Salvador Allende in Chile, whether it is overthrowing the government of Guatemala way back when -- these invasions, these toppling of governments, regime changes have unintended consequences. I would say that on this issue, I'm a little bit more conservative than the Secretary
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~It's not going to happen tomorrow. And it's probably not going to happen until we have real campaign finance reform and get rid of all these superpacs, and the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies. But at the end of the day, Nancy, here is the question -- in this great country of ours, with so much intelligence and so much capability, why do we remain the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right? Why do we continue to get ripped off by the drug companies who can charge us any prices they want? Why is it that we are spending per capita far, far more than Canada, which is 100 miles away from my door, that guarantees health care to all people? It will not happen tomorrow. But when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies, it will happen, and I will lead that effort. Medicare for all, single-payer system is the way we should go.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~John -- John, this country today has more income and wealth inequality than any major country on Earth. We have a corrupt campaign finance system dominated by Super PACs. We are the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee healthcare to all people. We have the highest rate of childhood poverty, and we're the only country in the world -- virtually the only country that doesn't guarantee paid family and medical leave. That's not the America that I think we should be. But in order to bring about the changes that we need, we need a political revolution. Millions of people are going to have to stand up, turn off the TV, get involved in the political process and tell the big- money interest that we are taking back our country. Please go to berniesanders.com. Please become part of the political revolution. Thank you. [applause]  [commercial break]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~John, I had the honor of being chairman of the U.S. Senate committee on Veterans' Affairs for two years. And in that capacity, I met with just an extraordinary group of people from World War II, from korea, vietnam, all of the wars. People came back from Iraq and Afghanistan without legs, without arms. And I was determined to do everything that I could to make VA health care the best in the world, to expand benefits to the men and women who put their lives on the line to defending. We brought together legislation supported by the American Legion, the VFW, the DOD, Vietnam Vets, all of the veterans organizations, which was comprehensive. Clearly the best piece of veterans' legislation brought forth in decades. I could only get two Republican votes on that. We ended up with 56 votes. We needed 60. So what I had to do then is go back and start working on a bill that wasn't the bill that I wanted. Sit down with people like John Mccain. Sit down with people like Jeff Miller, the Republican chairman of the house, and work on a bill. It wasn't the bill that I wanted, but yet it turned out to be one of the more significant pieces of veterans' legislation passed in recent history. So the crisis was I lost what I wanted. But I had to stand up and come back and get the best that we could.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Kathie, let me say this. You know, no public policy doesn't have, in some cases, negative consequences. But at the end of the day, what you have right now are millions of Americans working two or three jobs because their wages that they are earning are just too low. Real inflation accounted for wages has declined precipitously over the years. So I believe that, in fact, this country needs to move towards a living wage. It is not a radical idea to say that if somebody works 40 hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty. It is not a radical idea to say that a single mom should be earning enough money to take care of her kids. So I believe that over the next few years, not tomorrow, but over the next few years, we have got to move the minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour. And I apologize to nobody for that.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Let's do more -- let's do more than reverse the immunity. Let's
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Let me
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Let me do that but let me pick up on an issue, a very important issue that we have not yet discussed. This nation is the most powerful military in the world. We're spending over $600 billion a year on the military and yet, significantly less than 10 percent of that money is used to be fighting international terrorism. We are spending hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining 5,000 nuclear weapons. I think we need major reform in the military, making it more cost effective, but also focusing on the real crisis that faces us. The Cold War is over. And our focus has got to be on intelligence, increased manpower, fighting internationally targets. So, in terms of refugees, I believe that the United States has the moral responsibility with Europe, with Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia to make sure that when people leave countries like Afghanistan and Syria with nothing more than the clothing on their back that, of course, we reach out. Now, what the magic number is, I don't know, because we don't know the extent of the problem. But I certainly think that the United States should take its full responsibility in helping those people.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Let me hear if there's any difference between the Secretary and myself. I have voted time and again to -- for -- for the background check, and I want to see it improved and expanded. I want to see us do away with the gun show loophole. In 1988, I lost an election because I said we should not have assault weapons on the streets of America. We have to do away with the strawman proposal. We need radical changes in mental health in America so somebody who is suicidal or homicidal can get the emergency care they need. We have -- I don't know that there's any disagreement here
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Let me just
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Let me just add to that. Just because this is not an esoteric argument. You're seeing cities like Seattle. You're seeing cities like San Francisco, cities like Los Angeles doing it, and they are doing it well and workers are able to have more disposable income.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Let me put those proposals-- and you're absolutely right. That is what I want to do. That is what is going to have to happen, if we want to revitalize and rebuild the crumbling middle class. In the last 30 years, there has been a massive redistribution of wealth. And I know that term gets my Republican friends nervous. The problem is, this redistribution has gone in the wrong direction. Trillions of dollars have gone from the middle class and working families to the top one-tenth of one percent who have doubled the percentage of wealth they now own. Yes, I do believe that we must end corporate loopholes, such that major corporations year after year pay virtually zero in federal income tax, because they're stashing the money in the Cayman Islands. Yes, I do believe there must be a tax on Wall Street speculation. We bailed out Wall Street. It's their time to bail out the middle class, help our kids be able to go to college tuition-free. So we pay for this by do demanding that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations, who have gotten away with murder for years, start paying their fair share.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Look--
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~No, I have not.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~No, it is not throwing -- it is an extraordinary investment for this country. Germany, many other countries do it already. In fact, if you remember, 50, 60 years ago, the University of California, City University of New York were virtually tuition-free. Here is the story -- it's not just the college graduates should be $50,000 or $100,000 in debt. More importantly, I want kids in Burlington, Vermont, or Baltimore, Maryland, who are in the sixth grade or the eighth grade, who don't have a lot of money, whose parents -- like my parents -- may never have gone to college. Do you know where I'm going, Kevin? I want those kids to know that if they study hard, they do their homework, regardless of the income of their families, they will in fact be able to get a college education because we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. This is revolutionary for education in America. It will give hope to millions of young people.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~No. That's just media stuff. I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mail. I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mails. [laughter]And the issue is, the problem is, the front pages every day were dealing with it. I didn't know I had so much power. But after I said that, we're not hearing so much about Hillary Clinton's e-mails.What I would like for the media now is for us to be talking about why the middle class is disappearing, why we have more people in jail than any other country, why we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, and we're the only major country on Earth without paid family and medical leave. We've gotten off the Hillary's e-mails, good. Let's go to the major issues facing America. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Not good enough. [applause] Here's the story. I mean, you know, let's not be naive about it. Why do -- why, over her political career has Wall Street been a major -- the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton? You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so. Here is the major issue when we talk about Wall Street. It ain't complicated. You have six financial institutions today that have assets of 56 percent, equivalent to 56 percent of the GDP In America. They issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages. If Teddy Roosevelt, a good Republican, were alive today, you know what he'd say? "Break them up." Reestablish Glass-Steagall. And Teddy Roosevelt is right. That is the issue. Now I am the only candidate up here that doesn't have a super PAC. I am not asking Wall Street or the billionaires for money. I will break up these banks. Support community banks and credit unions. That's the future of banking in America.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~people all over this country -- not you, Secretary Clinton -- are shouting at each other. And what we need to do is bring people together to work on the agreement where there is broad consensus and that's what I intend to do. [crosstalk]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Right.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~So was I, John. Let me get a chance to respond. This issue touches on two broad issues. It's not just Wall Street. It's campaign -- a corrupt campaign finance system. And it is easy to talk the talk about ending Citizens United, but what I think we need to do is show by example that we are prepared to not rely on large corporations and Wall Street for campaign contributions, and that's what I'm doing. In terms of Wall Street, I respectfully disagree with you, madam secretary, in the sense that the issue here is when you have such incredible power and such incredible wealth. When you have Wall Street spending $5 billion over a 10-year period to get -- to get deregulated, the only answer they know is break them up, reestablish Glass-Stegall.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Thank you. [applause] Looking forward to it.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~That billionaires pay an effective tax rate lower than nurses or truck drivers. That makes no sense at all. There has to be real tax reform, and the wealthiest and large corporations will pay when I'm president.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~The big banks--
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~The issue is -- I believe, and I believe this honestly, and I don't know that there's much difference on guns between us. But I believe coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in position to reach out to the 60 or 70 percent of the American people who agree with us on those issues. The problem is
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~The Secretary's obviously right. It is enormously complicated. But here's something that I believe we have to do as we put together an international coalition, and that is we have to understand that the Muslim nations in the region -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Jordan -- all of these nations, they're going to have to get their hands dirty, their boots on the ground. They are going to have to take on ISIS. This is a war for the soul of Islam. And those countries who are opposed to Islam, they are going to have to get deeply involved in a way that is not the case today. We should be supportive of that effort. So should the UK, so should France. But those Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort. They are not doing it now.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~There were parts of that bill which agree with parts -- I disagree. I am certainly, absolutely, willing to look at that bill again and make sure there's a stronger bill.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~This is what I think -- this is what many economists believe that one of the reasons that real unemployment in this country is 10 percent, one of the reasons that African American youth unemployment and underemployment is 51 percent is the average worker in America doesn't have any disposable income. You have no disposable income when you are make 10, 12 bucks an hour. When we put money into the hands of working people, they're going to go out and buy goods, they're going to buy services and they're going to create jobs in doing that. Kathie, that is the kind of economy I believe, put money in the hands of working people, raise the minimum wage to 15 buck an hour.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~We don't eliminate Medicare. We expand Medicare to all people. And we will not, under this proposal, have a situation that we have right now with the Affordable Care Act where you have states like South Carolina, and many other Republican states, that because of their right wing political ideology, are denying millions of people the expansion of Medicaid that we passed in the Affordable Care Act. Ultimately, we have got to say as a nation, Secretary Clinton, is health care a right of all people or is it not? I believe it is a right.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~We have got to come forward with a consensus that in fact will work.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~We haven't come up with an exact number yet, but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90 percent. But it will be [laughter]I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower. [applause] But -- but we are going to end the absurdity, as Warren Buffet often remind us.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, (inaudible) the major issue right now is whether or not we reestablish Glass-Steagall. I led the effort, unfortunately unsuccessfully, against deregulation because I knew when you merge large insurance companies and investment banks and commercial banks it was not going to be good. The issue now is do we break them ?up do we reestablish Glass-Steagall. And Secretary Clinton, unfortunately, is on the wrong side.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, I -- if I might. I think the issue here is -- and I applaud Secretary Clinton. She did. She's the senator from New York. She worked -- and many of us supported you -- in trying to rebuild that devastation. But at the end of the day, Wall Street today has enormous economic and political power. Their business model is greed and fraud. And for the sake of our economy, they must -- the major banks must be broken up.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, I think that they're be pretty smart, because I think a lot of the states will do the right thing, and I think those states that don't will pay a heavy penalty. Bottom line here is, in the year 2015, we should look at a college degree the same way we looked at a high school degree 50 or 60 years ago. If you want to make it into the middle class -- I'm not saying in all cases -- we need plumbers, and we need carpenters, and electricians, that's for sure, and they should get help as well. But bottom line now, is in America, in the year 2015, any person who has the ability and the desire should be able to get an education, college education, regardless of the income of his or her family. And we must substantially lower, as my legislation does, interest rates on student debt.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, John, let me concur with you and with all Americans who are shocked and disgusted by what we saw in Paris yesterday. Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarous organization called ISIS. I'm running for president, because as I go around this nation, I talk to a lot of people. And what I hear is people's concern that the economy we have is a rigged economy. People are working longer hours for lower wages, and almost all of the new income and wealth goes to the top one percent. And then on top of that, we've got a corrupt campaign finance system in which millionaires and billionaires are pouring huge sums of money into super PACS heavily influencing the political process. What my campaign is about is a political revolution -- millions of people standing up and saying, enough is enough. Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the hand full of billionaires.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, let me just say something.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, this is what I would say, and the Congressman was right. According to the statistics that I'm familiar with, a black male baby born today stands a one in four chance of ending up in the criminal justice system. Fifty-one percent of high school African-American graduates are unemployed or underemployed. We have more people in jail today than any other country on earth. We're spending $80 billion locking people up, disproportionately Latino and African American. We need, very clearly, major, major reform in a broken criminal justice system. From top to bottom. And that means when police officers out in a community do illegal activity -- kill people who are unarmed who should not be killed, they must be held accountable. It means that we end minimum sentencing for those people arrested. It means that we take marijuana out of the federal law as a crime and give states the freedom to go forward with legalizing marijuana.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~What we need is leadership in this country which revitalizes American democracy, and makes people understand that if they stand up and fight back and take on the billionaire class, we can bring about the change that we need. If we are not successful, if we continue the same old, same old of Washington being run by corporate lobbyists and big-money interests, nothing changes. What I am very happy in this campaign that we have had rallies with tens of thousands of people, mostly young people. What the polls are showing is that we are actually defeating the secretary among younger people. We're giving young people and working people hope that real change can take place in America. That's what the political revolution is about.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~When you talk about the long-term consequences of war, let's talk about the men and women who came home from war. The 500,000 who came home with PTSD, and traumatic brain injury. And I would hope in the midst of all of this discussion, this country makes certain that we do not turn our backs on the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us, and that we stand with them as they have stood with us.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~With all -- with all due respect  [applause] I think it's fair to say that Baltimore is not now one of the safest cities in America, but the issue is
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Yeah.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Yes, I agree.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Yes.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~and 85 percent of gun owners agree.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~And I will also go after executives who are responsible for the decisions that have such bad consequences for our country. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~and that's what you and others can start providing in the Senate. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~But I do take what Alan Krueger said seriously. He is the foremost expert in our country on the minimum wage, and what its effects are. And the overall message is that it doesn't result in job loss. However, what Alan Krueger said in the piece you're referring to is that if we went to $15, there are no international comparisons. That is why I support a $12 national federal minimum wage. That is what the Democrats in the Senate have put forward as a proposal. But I do believe that is a minimum. And places like Seattle, like Los Angeles, like New York City, they can go higher. It's what happened in Governor O'Malley's state. There was a minimum wage at the state level, and some places went higher. I think that is
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~But wait, I just want to say this Senator. There is broad consensus, 92 percent in the most recently poll of Americans want gun safety measures
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~But you would index it -- you would index it to the median wage. Of course, you would. Do the $12 and you would index it. But I
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~He's not wall street.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~I -- I said I made a mistake on Iraq, and I would love to see Senator Sanders join with some of my colleague in addition the Senate that I see in the audience. Let's reverse the immunity. Let's put the gun makers and sellers on notice that they're not going to get away with it. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~I agree completely. [applause] I couldn't have said it better myself. But I did want to -- I wanted to follow up. Look, we need more Americans to be involved in the political process. And I give Senator Sanders a lot of credit for really lighting a fire under many people -- young, old, everybody -- who sees a chance to be involved and have their voice heard. Look at what's happening with the Republicans. They are doing everything they can to prevent the voices of Americans to be heard. [applause] They're trying to prevent people from registering to vote. So, we do need to take on the Republicans very clearly and directly. But the other thing I just wanted quickly to say is, I think President Obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done in Washington, despite the Republican obstructionists. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~I don't think we're at war with Islam. I don't think we're at war with all Muslims. I think we're at war with jihadists who have --
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~I think after 11 hours, that's pretty clear, yes. [applause] And, you know, I do think it's important to do exactly what Senator Sanders said, and that is to start talking about the issues that the American people really care about, and that they talk to each of us about. And to contrast, even -- there are differences among us. You've heard some of those tonight. I still want to get back to health care, because I think that's a worthy topic to explore. But the differences among us pale compared to what's happening on the Republican side. And if you listen to what they say -- and I had a chance over those 11 hours to watch and listen, as well as what I see in their debates -- they are putting forth alarming plans. I mean, all of us support funding Planned Parenthood. All of us believe climate change is real. All of us want equal pay for equal work. They don't believe in any of that. So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~I think that is the number one requirement. I also said that we should take increased numbers of refugees. The administration originally said 10. I said we should go to 65, but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine, whatever resources it takes because I do not want us to, in any way, inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country. But I want to say a quick word about what Senator Sanders and then Governor O'Malley said. We do have to take a hard look at the defense budget and we do have to figure out how we get ready to fight the adversaries of the future, not the past. But we have to also be very clear that we do have some continuing challenges. We've got challenges in the South China Sea because of what China is doing in building up these military installations. We have problems with Russia. Just the other day, Russia allowed a television camera to see the plans for a drone submarine that could carry a tactical nuclear weapon. So we've got to look at the full range and then come to some smart decisions about having more streamlined and focused approach.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~I think that is the smartest way to be able to move forward because if you go to $12 it would be the highest historical average we've ever had.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~I think THAT you can talk about Islamists who clearly are also jihadists, but I think it's not particularly helpful to make the case that Senator Sanders was just making that I agree with, that we've got to reach out to Muslim countries. We've got to have them be part of our coalition. If they hear people running for president who basically shortcut it to say we are somehow against Islam, that was one of the real contributions, despite all the other problems, that George W. Bush made after 9/11 when he basically said after going to a Mosque in Washington, we are not at war with Islam or Muslims. We are at war with violent extremism. We are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression. And, yes, we are at war with those people. But I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~I think with this kind of barbarism and nihilism, it's very hard to understand, other than the lust for power, the rejection of modernity, the total disregard for human rights, freedom, or any other value that we know and respect. Historically, it is important to try to understand your adversary in order to figure out how they are thinking, what they will be doing, how they will react. I plead that it's very difficult when you deal with ISIS and organizations like that whose behavior is so barbaric and so vicious that it doesn't seem to have any purpose other than lust for killing and power and that's very difficult to put ourselves in the other shoe. [crosstalk]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~I will do everything I can as president to get that accomplished.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~It certainly does cover it. I would like to see it updated.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Kathie, I think -- Kathie the
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Kevin, if I could just jump in. I -- I believe that we should make community college free. We should have debt-free college if you go to a public college or university. You should not have to borrow a dime to pay tuition. I want to use pell grants to help defray the living expenses that often make a difference, whether a young person can stay in school or not. I disagree with free college for everybody. I don't think taxpayers should be paying to send Donald Trump's kids to college. I think it ought to be a compact -- families contribute, kids contribute. And together we make it possible for a new generation of young people to refinance their debt and not come out with debt in the future.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~No, it would have to go through the Congress, and I know the White House has actually been working with members of Congress. Maybe now we can get it moving again so that we can upgrade it so that it does include all the tools and everything in our arsenal that we can use to try to work with our allies and our friends, come up with better intelligence. You know, it is difficult finding intelligence that is actionable in a lot of these places, but we have to keep trying. And we have to do more to prevent the flood of foreign fighters that have gone to Syria, especially the ones with western passports, that come back. So there's a lot of work we need to do and I want to be sure what's called the AUMF, has the authority that is needed going forward.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~No. Revolution never came. I waited and I got the scars to show for it. We now have this great accomplishment known as the Affordable Care Act, and I don't think we should have to be defending it among Democrats. We ought to be working to improve it and prevent Republicans from both underming it and even repealing it. I have looked at -- I have looked at the legislation that Senator Sanders has proposed, and basically, he does eliminate the Affordable Care Act, eliminates private insurance, eliminates Medicare, eliminates Medicaid, Tricare, children's health insurance program -- puts it all together in a big program which he then hands over to the states to administer. And I have to tell you, I would not want -- if I lived in Iowa, Terry Branstad administering my health care. I -- I think -- I think as Democrats we ought to proudly support the Affordable Care Act, improve it, and make it the model that we know it can be.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Oh, wait a minute, senator. You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small. And I'm very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60 percent. [applause] So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked. Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York. It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country. So, you know, it's fine for you to say what you're going to say, but I looked very carefully at your proposal. Reinstating Glass- Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough. My proposal is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive because I go after all of Wall Street not just the big banks.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Thank you, John. Well, thank you, John. I think it's important we put this in historic context. The United States has, unfortunately, been victimized by terrorism going back decades. In the 1980s, it was in Beirut, Lebanon, under President Reagan's administration, and 258 Americans, marines, embassy personnel, and others were murdered. We also had attacks on two of our embassies in Tanzania, Kenya, when my husband was president. Again, Americans murdered. And then, of course, 9/11 happened, which happened before there was an invasion of Iraq. I have said the invasion of Iraq was a mistake. But I think if we're ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extreme terrorism, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq and we have to continue to be vigilant about it.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~That's not fair. He's a progressive economist. [crosstalk]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~We've got the consensus, what we're lacking is political leadership
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well John, wait a minute. Wait a minute, he has basically used his answer to impune my integrity. Let's be frank here.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, first of all, I know that the President has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court. And my reading of the law and the Constitution convinces me that the President has the authority that he is attempting to exercise with respect to dreamers and their parents, because I think all of us on this stage agree that we need comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. Border security has always been a part of that debate. And it is a fact that the net immigration from Mexico and South has basically zeroed out. So, what we want to do is to say, look, we have 11 million people who have been here, many of them for decades. They have children who are doing so well, I've met and worked with dreamers. I think any parent would be so proud of them. So let's move toward what we should be doing as a nation and follow the values of our immigration history and begin to make it possible for them to come out of the shadows and to have a future that gives them a full chance of citizenship. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, first of all, it isn't the middle class. I have made very clear that hardworking, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase. In fact, wages adjusted for inflation haven't risen since the turn of the last century, after my husband's administration. So we have a lot of work to do to get jobs going again, get incomes rising again. And I have laid out specific plans -- you can go to my web site, hillaryclinton.com, and read the details. And I will pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more, closing corporate loopholes, deductions, and other kinds of favorable treatment. And I can do it without raising the debt, without raising taxes on the middle class and making it reasonably manageable within our budget so that we can be fiscally responsible at the same time.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, I'll tell you who is on my side. Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize winning economist, who said my plan for what we should do to reign in Wall Street was more comprehensive and better. Paul Volcker, one of the leading lights of trying to reign in the excesses, has also said he does not support reinstating Glass-Steagall. So, I mean this may seem like a bit of an arcane discussion. I have nothing against the passion that my two friends here have about reinstating Glass-Steagall. I just don't think it would get the job done. I'm all about making sure we actually get results for whatever we do. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, I'm sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression because I worked closely with New Yorkers after 9/11 for my entire first term to rebuild. So, yes, I did know people. I've had a lot of folks give me donations from all kinds of backgrounds say, I don't agree with you on everything, but I like what you do. I like how you stand up. I'm going to support you, and I think that is absolutely appropriate. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, I think -- I think that is very unfair to a few you mentioned, most particularly Jordan, which has put a lot on the line for the United States, has also taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, and has been, therefore, subjected to threats and attacks by extremists themselves. I do agree that in particular, Turkey and the Gulf nations have got to make up their minds. Are they going to stand with us against this kind of jihadi radicalism or not? And there are many ways of doing it. They can provide forces. They can provide resources. But they need to be absolutely clear about where they stand.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, I think it's perfectly fair to say that we invested quite a bit in development aid. Some of the bravest people that I had the privilege of working with as secretary of state were our development professionals who went sometimes alone, sometimes with our military, into very dangerous places in Iraq, in Afghanistan, elsewhere. So, there does need to be a whole of government approach, but just because we're involved and we have a strategy doesn't mean we're going to be able to dictate the outcome. These are often very long- term kinds of investments that have to be made. [crosstalk]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, I think it's pretty clear that they know that I will. You have two billionaire hedge fund managers who started a super PAC and they're advertising against me in Iowa as we speak. So they clearly think I'm going to do what I say I will do and you can look at what I did in the Senate. I did introduce legislation to reign in compensation. I looked at ways that the shareholders would have more control over what was going on in that arena. And specifically said to Wall Street, that what they were doing in the mortgage market was bringing our country down. I've laid out a very aggressive plan to reign in Wall Street -- not just the big banks. That's a part of the problem and I am going right at them. I have a comprehensive, tough plan. But I went further than that. We have to go after what is called the shadow banking industry. Those hedge funds. Look at what happened in '08, AIG, a big insurance company, Lehman Brothers, an investment bank helped to bring our economy down. So, I want to look at the whole problem and that's why my proposal is much more comprehensive than anything else that's been put forth.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, I think that there are different records. I -- you know, know that Senator Sanders had a different vote than I did when it came to giving immunity to gun makers and sellers. That was a terrible mistake. It basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate legislators, not just in Washington but across the country. But just think about this-- since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns. Twenty-one mass shootings, including one last weekend in Des Moins where three were murdered. Two hundred children have been killed. This is an emergency. There are a lot of things we've got to do in our country, reigning in Wall Street is certainly one of them. I agree with that. That's why I've got such a good plan. But we have to also go after the gun lobby and 92 percent of Americans agree we should have universal background checks. Close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole and  [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, John, I come from the '60s, a long time ago. There was a lot of activism on campus -- Civil Rights activism, antiwar activism, women's rights activism -- and I do appreciate the way young people are standing up and speaking out. Obviously, I believe that on a college campus, there should be enough respect so people hear each other. But what happened at the university there, what's happening at other universities, I think reflects the deep sense of, you know, concern, even despair that so many young people, particularly of color, have  You know, I recently met with a group of mothers who lost their children to either killings by police or random killings in their neighborhoods, and hearing their stories was so incredibly, profoundly heartbreaking. Each one of them, you know, described their child, had a picture. You know, the mother of the young man with his friends in the car who was playing loud music and, you know, some older white man pulled out a gun and shot him because they wouldn't turn the radio down. Or a young woman who had been performing at President Obama's second inauguration coming home, absolutely stellar young woman, hanging out with her friends in a park getting shot by a gang member. And, of course, I met the mothers of Eric Garner and Tamir Rice, and Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin and so many of them who have lost their children. So, your original question is the right question. And it's not just a question for parents and grandparents to answer. It's really a question for all of us to answer, every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her god-given potential. And that's what we need to be doing to the best of our ability in our country.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, John, I think that we have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network. It cannot be contained, it must be defeated. There is no question in my mind that if we summon our resources, both our leadership resources and all of the tools at our disposal, not just military force, which should be used as a last resort, but our diplomacy, our development aid, law enforcement, sharing of intelligence in a much more open and cooperative way -- that we can bring people together. But it cannot be an American fight. And I think what the president has consistently said-- which I agree with-- is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS. That is why we have troops in Iraq that are helping to train and build back up the Iraqi military, why we have special operators in Syria working with the Kurds and Arabs, so that we can be supportive. But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, John, look, I think that what happened when we abided by the agreement that George W. Bush made with the Iraqis to leave by 2011, is that an Iraqi army was left that had been trained and that was prepared to defend Iraq. Unfortunately, Nouri al-Maliki, the prime minister, set about decimating it. And then, with the revolution against Assad -- and I did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early so that we would have a better idea of how to deal with Assad because I thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum. So, yes, this has developed. I think that there are many other reasons why it has in addition to what happened in the region, but I don't think that the United States has the bulk of the responsibility. I really put that on Assad and on the Iraqis and on the region itself.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, look, I believe that we've made great progress as a country with the Affordable Care Act. We've been struggling to get this done since Harry Truman. And it was not only a great accomplishment of the Democratic Party, but of President Obama. I do think that it's important to defend it. The Republicans have voted to repeal it nearly 60 times. They would like to rip it up and start all over again, throw our nation back into this really contentious debate that we've had about health care for quite some time now. I want to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act. I would certainly tackle the cost issues, because I think that once the foundation was laid with a system to try to get as many people as possible into it, to end insurance discrimination against people with preexisting conditions or women, for example, that, yes, we were going to have to figure out how to get more competition in the insurance market, how to get the costs of -- particularly, prescription drugs, but other out-of-pocket expenses down. But I think it's important to understand there's a significant difference that I have with Senator Sanders about how best to provide quality, affordable health care for everyone. And it's-- it's a worthy debate. It's an important one that we should be engaged in.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, of course, each of these cases needs to be looked at individually and analyzed. Part of the problem that we have currently in the Middle East is that Assad has hung on to power with the very strong support of Russia and Iran and with the proxy of Hezbollah being there basically fighting his battles. So I don't think you can paint with a broad brush. This is an incredibly complicated region of the world. It's become more complicated. And many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the United States has either started or have a role in. The Shi'a-Sunni split. The dictatorships have suppressed people's aspirations. The increasing globalization without any real safety valve for people to have a better life. We saw that in Egypt. We saw a dictator overthrown. We saw a Muslim brotherhood president installed, and then we saw him ousted and the army back. So, I think we've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing and no place is more so than in the Middle East.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, our prayers are with the people of France tonight, but that is not enough. We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, a barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist terrorist group. This election is not only about electing a president. It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief. And I will be laying out in detail, what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coordinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism. Our country deserves no less, because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, thank you very much to CBS and everyone here this evening for giving us another chance to appear before you. I've heard a lot about me in this debate, and I'm going to keep talking and thinking about all of you because ultimately, I think the president's job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do to lift up the people of this country. [applause] Starting with our children and moving forward. I've spent my entire life, since I started as a young lawyer for the Children's Defense Fund, trying to figure out how we can even the odds for so many people in America, this great country of ours, who are behind, who don't have a chance. And that's what I will do as your president. I will work my heart out. I need your help. All of you in Iowa, I need you to caucus for me. Please go to hillaryclinton.com and be part of making this country what we know it can and should be. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, there are so many, I don't know where to start. [laughter]I guess the one I -- I would pick is the fact that I was part of a very small group that had to advise the president about whether or not to go after Bin Laden. I spent a lot of time in the situation room as secretary of state and there were many very difficult choices presented to us. But probably that was the most challenging because there was no certainty attached to it. The intelligence was by no means absolute. We had all kinds of questions that we discussed and, you know, at the end, I recommended to the president that we take the chance to do what we could to find out whether that was bin Laden and to finally bring him to justice. It was an excruciating experience. I couldn't talk to anybody about it. In fact, after it happened, the president called my husband -- he called all the former presidents and he said to Bill, "Well I assume Hillary has told you about this." And Bill said, "No, no, she hasn't." There was nobody to talk to and it really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, we're going to have to redo the way the prescription drug industry does business. For example, it is outrageous that we don't have an opportunity for Medicare to negotiate for lower prices. In fact, American consumers pay the highest prices in the world for drugs that we help to be developed through the National Institute of Health and that we then tested through the FDA. So there's more to my plan than just the cap. We have to go after price gouging and monopolistic practices and get Medicare the authority to negotiate.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, we did have a plan, and I think it's fair to say that of all of the Arab leaders, Gaddafi probably had more blood on his hands of Americans than anybody else. And when he moved on his own people, threatening a massacre, genocide, the Europeans and the Arabs, our allies and partners, did ask for American help and we provided it. And we didn't put a single boot on the ground, and Gaddafi was deposed. The Libyans turned out for one of the most successful, fairest elections that any Arab country has had. They elected moderate leaders. Now, there has been a lot of turmoil and trouble as they have tried to deal with these radical elements which you find in this arc of instability, from north Africa to Afghanistan. And it is imperative that we do more not only to help our friends and partners protect themselves and protect our own homeland, but also to work to try to deal with this arc of instability, which does have a lot of impact on what happens in a country like Libya.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, we have an authorization to use military force against terrorists. We passed it after 9/11.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, you know, governor, I know that when you had a chance to appoint a commissioner for financial regulation, you chose an investment banker in 2010. So for me, it is looking at what works and what we need to do to try to move past what happened in '08.And I will go back and say again, AIG was not a big bank. It had to be bailed out and it nearly destroyed us. Lehman Brothers was not a big bank. It was an investment bank. And its bankruptcy and its failure nearly destroyed us. So I've said, if the big banks don't play by the rules, I will break them up.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Yes.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~$10.10 was all I could get the state to do by the time I left in my last year. But two of our counties actually went to $12.80 and their county executives, if they were here tonight, would also tell you that it works. The fact of the matter is, the more our people earn, the more money they spend, and the more our whole economy grows. That's American capitalism.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~All right, Nancy, I really wish you'd come back to me on this on this one, John
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~and I encourage everybody watching this tonight to please, acknowledge that by going online at martinomalley.com and help me wage this campaign for real American capitalism. [applause]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~And may I point out that under Ronald Reagan's first term, the highest marginal rate was 70 percent. And in talking to a lot of our neighbors who are in that super wealthy, millionaire and billionaire category, a great numbers of them love their country enough to do more again in order to create more opportunity for America's middle class.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~And start taking advice
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Because we have found a way to reduce hospital costs, so whenever we come
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~But it's a lot safer. It's saved a lot of lives along the way, Senator.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Come on now. Yeah, but look. It should always be going up. Again, with all do respect to Secretary Clinton
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Didn't just happen.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~I'd like to take a matter of personal privilege here
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~I believe calling it what it is, is to say radical jihadis. That's calling it what it is. But John, let's not fall into the trap of thinking that all of our Muslim American neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here. They are our first line of defense. And we are going to be able to defeat ISIS on the ground there, as well as in this world, because of the Muslim Americans in our country and throughout the world who understand that this brutal and barbaric group is perverting the name of a great world religion. And now, like never before, we need our Muslim American neighbors to stand up and to -- and to be a part of this.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~I think we need to stop taking our advice from economists on Wall Street
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~I would want us to take our place among the nations of the world to alleviate this sort of death and the specter we saw of little kids' bodies washing up on a beach.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~John, I don't think that there is a crisis at the state or local level that really you can point to and say, therefore, I am prepared for the sort of crises that any man or woman who is commander in chief of our country has to deal with. But I can tell you this. I can tell you that as a mayor and as a governor, I learned certain disciplines which I believe are directly applicable to that very, very powerful and most important of all jobs in the United States, the president, whose first and primary duty is to protect the people of our country. You learn that threats always change. You learn to create a security cabinet. You learn to create feedback mechanisms. You learn to constantly evaluate and understand the nature of the threats that you are being faced with. I have been tried under many different emergencies and I can tell you that in each of those emergencies, whether they were inflicted by drug gangs, whether they were natural emergencies, I knew how to lead and I knew how to govern because I know how to manage people in a crisis and be very clear about the goal of protecting human life.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~John, I think somewhere between
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~John, I think the -- I think the call of your question is how can we improve both public safety in America and race relations in America, understanding how very intertwined both of those issues are in a very, very difficult and painful way for us as a people. Look, the truth of the matter is that we should all feel a sense of responsibility as Americans to look for the things that actually work to save and redeem lives, and to do more of them, and to stop doing the things that don't. For my part, that's what I have done in 15 years of experience as a mayor and as a governor. We restored voting rights to 52,000 people. We decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana. I repealed the death penalty. And we also put in place a civilian review board. We reported openly discourtesy, and lethal force and brutality complaints. This is something that -- and I put forward a new agenda for criminal justice reform that is informed by that experience. So as president, I would lead these efforts, and I would do so with more experience and probably the attendance at more grave sites than any of the three of us on this stage when it comes to urban crime, loss of lives. And the truth is I have learned on a very daily basis that, yes, indeed, black lives matter.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~John, I was the first person on this stage to say that we should accept the 65,000 Syrian refugees that were fleeing the sort of murder of ISIL, and I believe that that needs to be done with proper screening. But accommodating 65,000 refugees in our country today, people of 320 million, is akin to making room for 6.5 more people in a baseball stadium with 32,000. There are other ways to lead and to be a moral leader in this world, rather than at the opposite end of a drone strike. But I would want to agree with something that Senator Sanders says. The nature of warfare has changed. This is not a conflict where we send in the third divisions of Marines. This is a new era of conflict where traditional ways of huge standing armies are not as -- serve our purposes as well as special ops, better intelligence and being more proactive.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~John, I would disagree with Secretary Clinton respectfully on this score. This actually is America's fight. It cannot solely be America's fight. America is best when we work in collaboration with our allies. America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world. And ISIS, make no mistake about it, is an evil in this world. ISIS has brought down a Russian airliner. ISIS has now attacked a western democracy in -- in France. And we do have a role in this. Not solely ours, but we must work collaboratively with other nations. The great failing of these last 10 or 15 years, John, has been our failing of human intelligence on the ground. Our role in the world is not to roam the globe looking for new dictators to topple. Our role in the world is to make ourselves a beacon of hope. Make ourselves stronger at home, but also our role in the world, yes, is also to confront evil when it rises. We took out the safe haven in Afghanistan, but now there is, undoubtedly, a larger safe haven and we must rise to this occasion in collaboration and with alliances to confront it, and invest in the future much better human intelligence so we know what the next steps are.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~John, John,
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~John, may I -- may I interject here? Secretary Clinton also said we -- it was not just the invasion of Iraq which Secretary Clinton voted for and has since said was a big mistake -- and, indeed, it was. But it was also the cascading effects that followed that. It was also the disbanding of many elements of the Iraqi army that are now showing up as part of ISIS. It was country after country without making the investment in human intelligence to understand who the new leaders were and the new forces were that are coming up. We need to be much more far thinking in this new 21st century era of -- of nation state failures and conflict. It's not just about getting rid of a single dictator. It is about understanding the secondary and third consequences that fall next.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~John, please, it's-- personal privilege, John.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~John, thank you, and to all of the people in Iowa, for the role you have performed in this presidential selection process. If you believe that our country's problems and the threats that we face in this world can only be met with new thinking, new and fresh approaches, then I ask you to join my campaign. Go on to martinomalley.com. No hour is too short, no dollar too small. If you -- we will not solve our nation's problems by resorting to the divisive ideologies of our past, or by returning to polarizing figures from our past. We are at the threshold of a new era of American progress, but it's going to require that we act as Americans, based on our principles, here at home, making an economy that works for all of us. And, also, acting according to our principles and constructing a new foreign policy of engagement and collaboration, and doing a much better job of identifying threats before they back up into military corners. There is no challenge too great for the United States to confront, provided we have the ability and the courage to put forward new leadership that can move us to those better and safer and more prosperous days. I need your help. Thank you very, very much. [applause]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~John, the world is a very dangerous place, but the world is not too dangerous of a place for the United States of America, provided we act according to our principles, provided we act intelligently. I mean, let's talk about this arc of instability that Secretary Clinton talked about. Libya is now a mess. Syria is a mess. Iraq is a mess. Afghanistan is a mess. As Americans, we have shown ourselves to have the greatest military on the face of the planet, but we are not so very good at anticipating threats and appreciating just how difficult it is to build up stable democracies, to make the investments and sustainable development that we must as a nation if we are to attack the root causes of these sorts of instability. And I wanted to add one other thing, John, and I think it's important for all of us on this stage. I was in Burlington, Iowa. And a mom of a service member of ours who served two duties in Iraq said, Governor O' Malley, please, when you're with your other candidates and colleagues on stage, please don't use the term 'boots on the ground'. Let's don't use the term 'boots on the ground'. My son is not a pair of boots on the ground. These are American soldiers and we fail them when we fail to take into account what happens the day after a dictator falls and when we fail to act with a whole of government approach with sustainable development, diplomacy, and our economic power in alignment with our principles.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~John, there is not a serious economist who would disagree that the six big banks of Wall Street have taken on so much power and that all of us are still on the hook to bail them out on their bad bets. That's not capitalism, Secretary Clinton. That's crony capitalism. That's a wonderful business model. If you place bad bets, the taxpayers bail you out. But if you place good ones, you pocket it. Look, I don't believe there's the model -- there's lots of good people that work in finance, Secretary Sanders, but Secretary Clinton, we need to step up and we need to protect Main Street from Wall Street and you can't do that by -- by campaigning as the candidate of Wall Street. I am not the candidate of Wall Street
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~John, this is another one of those examples. Like we have a -- we have a lot of work to do and we're the only nation on the planet that buries as many of our people from gun violence as we do. In my own state, after the children in that Connecticut classroom were gunned down, we passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with background checks, ban on assault weapons, and Senator, I think we do need to repeal that immunity that you granted to the gun industry. But Secretary Clinton, you've been on three sides of this. When you ran in 2000, you said that we needed federal robust regulations. Then, in 2008, you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying that we don't need those regulations on the federal level and now you're coming back around here. So John, there's a big difference between leading by polls and leading with principle. We got it done in my state by leading with principal and that's what we need to do as a party for comprehensive gun safety.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Kathie, this was not merely theory in Maryland. We actually did it. Not only were we the first state in the nation to pass a living wage. We were the first to pass a minimum wage. And the U.S. chamber of commerce, which hardly ever says nice things about Democratic governors anywhere, named our state number one for innovation and entrepreneurship. We defended the highest median income in the country. And so, look, the way that -- a stronger middle class is actually the source of economic growth. And if our middle class makes more money, they spend more money, and our whole economy grows. We did it, and it worked, and nobody headed for the hills or left the state because of it.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~May I jump in here for 30 seconds on health care?
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~My heart, like all of us in this room, John, and all the people across our country, my hearts go out to the people of France in this moment of loss. Parents, and sons, and daughters and family members, and as our hearts go out to them and as our prayers go out to them, we must remember this, that this isn't the new face of conflict and warfare, not in the 20th century but the new face of conflict and warfare in the 21st century. And there is no nation on the planet better able to adapt to this change than our nation. We must able to work collaboratively with others. We must anticipate these threats before they happen. This is the new sort of challenge, the new sort of threat that does, in fact, require new thinking, fresh approaches and new leadership. As a former mayor and a former governor, there was never a single day, John, when I went to bed or woke up without realizing that this could happen in our own country. We have a lot of work to do, to better prepare our nation and to better lead this world into this new century.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Nancy, the blueprint in Maryland that we followed was yes, we did in fact raise the sales tax by a penny and we made our public schools the best public schools in America for five years in a row with that investment. And yes, we did ask everyone -- the top 14 percent of earners in our state to pay more in their income tax and we were the only state to go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuitions. So while other candidates will talk about the things they would like to do, I actually got these things done in a state that defended not only a AAA bond rating, but the highest median income in America. I believe that we pay for many of the things that we need to do again as a nation, investing in the skills of our people, our infrastructure, and research and development and also climate change by the elimination of one big entitlement that we can no longer afford as a people, and that is the entitlement that many of our super wealthiest citizens feel they are entitled to pay -- namely, a much lower income tax rate and a lower tax rate on capital gains. I believe capital gains, for the most part, should be taxed the same way we tax income from hard work, sweat, and toil. And if we do those things, we can be a country that actually can afford debt-free college again.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Oh, yes there is. [laughter
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Okay, thank you. I have -- look, I would agree with much of what Senator Sanders says, Kevin. I believe that actually affordable college, debt-free college is the goal that we need to attain as a nation. And, unlike my two distinguished colleagues on this stage, I actually made college more affordable and was the only state that went four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition. I respectfully disagree with Senator Sander's approach. I believe that the goal should be debt-free college. I believe that our Federal Government needs to do more on pell grants. States need to stop cutting higher education, and we should create a new block grant program that keeps the states' skin in the game, and we should lower these outrageous interest rates that parents and kids are being charged by their own government. 7 percent and 8 percent to go to college? I mean, my dad went to college on a G.I. Bill after coming home from Japan, flying 33 missions. My daughters went to college on a mountain of bills. We were proud of them on graduation day, but we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives. It -- it doesn't need to be that way. We can have debt-free college in the United States.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Thank you.  [commercial break]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~That's right.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~That's what I understand is the request from the international
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~They are the architects. Sure, we'll have an inclusive group but I won't be taking my orders from Wall Street. And look, let me say this. I put out a proposal. I was on the front lines when people lost their homes, when people lost their jobs. I was on the front lines as a governor fighting against -- fighting that battle. Our economy was wrecked by the big banks of Wall Street. And Secretary Clinton, when you put out your proposal on Wall Street, it was greeted by many as, quote, unquote, "Weak tea". It is weak tea. It is not what the people expect of our country. We expect that our president will protect the main street economy from excesses on Wall Street. And that's why Bernie's right. We need to reinstate a modern version of Glass-Steagall and we should have done it already. [applause]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, I'll tell you what, I've said this before. I don't -- I believe that we actually need some new economic thinking in the White House. And I would not have Robert Rubin or Larry Summers, with all due respect, Secretary Clinton, to you and to them, back on my council of economic advisers.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~November 14, 2015~Well, Mr. Cooney, we've actually been focusing on border security to the exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform. In fact, if more border security and these -- and more and more deportations were going to bring our Republican brothers and sisters to the table, it would have happened long ago. The fact of the matter is -- and let's say it in our debate, because you'll never hear this from that immigration-bashing carnival barker, Donald Trump, the truth of the matter is  [applause] The truth of the matter is, net immigration from Mexico last year was zero. Fact check me. Go ahead. Check it out. But the truth of the matter is, if we want wages to go up, we've got to get 11 million of our neighbors out of off the book shadow economy, and into the full light of an American economy. That's what our parents and grandparents always did. That's what we need to do as a nation. Yes, we must protect our borders. But there is no substitute for having comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people, many of whom have known no other country but the United States of America. Our symbol is the Statue of Liberty. It is not a barbed wire fence.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~&mdash;but Chuck, it is a public financing system that everybody knows is antiquated. It no longer works. Nobody can become president based on that system. So what's the alternative? There are two alternatives. And, you know, we looked at it. Well, should we do a Super PAC, but I concluded, honestly, I don't represent Corporate America or billionaires, I didn't want it.So the other alternative was to ask working families and the middle class to help out in a transformational campaign. And you know what? We got 3.5 million individual contributions, $27 a piece. I think that's pretty good. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~[inaudible]. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~[off-mike]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~[off-mike] I fully, fully concede that Secretary Clinton, who was secretary of State for four years, has more experience&mdash;hat is not arguable&mdash;in foreign affairs. But experience is not the only point, judgment is. And once again, back in 2002, when we both looked at the same evidence about the wisdom of the war in Iraq, one of us voted the right way and one of us didn't.In terms of Iran and in terms of Saudi Arabia, of course they hate each other. That's no great secret. But John Kerry, who is I think doing a very good job, has tried to at least get these people in the room together because both of them are being threatened by ISIS.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Absolutely right.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Absolutely. I think the Secretary described the situation appropriately.You know, I don't go around asking for governor's resignations every day. In fact, I think I never have in my life. But I did ask for the resignation of Governor Snyder because his irresponsibility [applause] was so outrageous.What we are talking about are children being poisoned. That's what we're talking about. We don't know, no one knows for sure because they haven't done the appropriate studies, but there's no question that kids' intellectual development may have been impacted. We don't know how many thousands.The idea that there has not been a dramatic response is beyond comprehension. And when you have one of the, I think, significant public health crises of recent years, of course the federal government comes in.And of course the federal government says, you're not going to be poisoning little kids and impacting their entire lives.Last point on this. And I suspect the secretary agrees. One wonders if this were a white suburban community what kind of response there would have been. [applause]Flint, Michigan, is a poor community. It is disproportionately African-American and minority. And what has happened there is absolutely unacceptable.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~And by the way&mdash;and by the way, if I may, the secretary probably doesn't know that there's not a day that goes by when I am not asked to attack her on that issue, and I have refrained from doing that and I will continue to refrain from doing that. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~And let me just say this. As Secretary Clinton may know, I am on the Health Education Labor Committee. That committee wrote the Affordable Care Act. The idea I would dismantle health care in America while we're waiting to pass a Medicare for all is just not accurate. The Affordable Care Act has clearly, as Secretary Clinton made the point, done a lot of good things, but, what it has not done is dealt with the fact we have 29 million people today who have zero health insurance, we have even more who are underinsured with large deductibles and copayments and prescription drug prices are off the wall.So I do believe that in the future, not by dismantling what we have here&mdash;I helped write that bill&mdash;but by moving forward, rallying the American people, I do believe we should have health care for all.

Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~But that was only for&mdash;that was not to be on television. That's an important point. That was just something&mdash;as the secretary knows, you put titles on ads and you send them out, but there was no word in that ad, none, that said that those newspapers had endorsed us.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Chuck, actually we looked at it, but it turns out to be a disaster. The way it is structured right now, if you make it all the way to California, you could do pretty well. But in terms of the early states&mdash;Iowa, New Hampshire, the other states&mdash;it just doesn't work.Your point is well taken. I believe in public funding of elections, absolutely. But this system is&mdash;I don't know if the secretary would agree&mdash;is currently very antiquated and no longer applies to modern day politics.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Chuck, I believe in trade, but I do not believe in unfettered free trade. I believe in fair trade which works for the middle class and working families of this country and not just large multinational corporations.I was not only in opposition to NAFTA&mdash;and this is an area where the secretary and I have disagreements. I was not only in opposition to NAFTA, I was on the picket line in opposition to NAFTA because I understood&mdash;I don't think this is really rocket science.We heard all of the people tell us how many great jobs would be created. I didn't believe that for a second because I understood what the function of NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, and the TPP is, it's to say to American workers, hey, you are now competing against people in Vietnam who make 56 cents an hour minimum wage.I don't want American workers to compete against people making 56 cents an hour. I don't want companies shutting down in America, throwing people out on the street, moving to China, and bringing their products back into this country.So, do I believe in trade? Of course, I believe in trade. But the current trade agreements over the last 30 years were written by corporate America, for corporate America, resulted in the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs, 60,000 factories in America lost since 2001, millions of decent-paying jobs; and also a downward spiral, a race to the bottom where employers say, "Hey, you don't want to take a cut in pay? We're going to China."Workers today are working longer hours for lower wages. Trade is one of the reasons for that. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Clearly North Korea is a very strange situation because it is such an isolated country run by a handful of dictators, or maybe just one, who seems to be somewhat paranoid. And, who had nuclear weapons.And, our goal there, in my view, is to work and lean strongly on China to put as much pressure. China is one of the few major countries in the world that has significant support for North Korea, and I think we got to do everything we can to put pressure on China. I worry very much about an isolated, paranoid country with atomic bombs.I think, clearly, we got to work closely with China to resolve the serious problems we have, and I worry about Putin and his military adventurism in the Crimea and the Ukraine.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~I agree with what the secretary said. We shouldn't be getting ahead of ourselves. And as I have said many times, you know, sometimes in these campaigns, things get a little bit out of hand. I happen to respect the secretary very much, I hope it's mutual. And on our worst days, I think it is fair to say we are 100 times better than any Republican candidate. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~I am absolutely supportive of comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship for 11 million people today who are living in the shadows. All right? We got to do that. [applause]But you miss&mdash;when you looked at the issues, you missed two of the most important. And that is you're not going to accomplish what has to be done for working families and the middle class unless there is campaign finance reform. [applause]So long as big money interests control the United States Congress, it is gonna be very hard to do what has to be done for working families. So let me be very clear. No nominee of mine, if I'm elected president, to the United States Supreme Court will get that nomination unless he or she is loud and clear, and says they will vote to overturn Citizens United. [applause]Second point&mdash;second point is that the only way we make change in terms of health care, in terms of dealing with a broken criminal justice system which, today, allows us to have more people in jail than any other country&mdash;largely African-American and Latino&mdash;the only way we create millions of jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure or have a tax system that says to the wealthy that they are going to pay their fair share, is when millions of people become involved in the political process.No, you just can't negotiate with Mitch McConnell. Mitch is gonna have to look out the window and see a whole lot of people saying, "Mitch, stop representing the billionaire class. Start listening to working families."And as president, that's what I will work hard on. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~I am feeling exactly the way I felt at the first debate. There's a process under way. I will not politicize it.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~I am&mdash;will absolutely admit that Secretary Clinton has the support of far more governors, mayors, members of the House. She has the entire establishment or almost the entire establishment behind her. That's a fact. I don't deny it.But I am pretty proud that we have over a million people who have contributed to our campaign averaging 27 bucks apiece. That we have had meetings where 25,000-30,000 people have come out. That our campaign is a campaign of the people, by the people, and for the people.So, Rachel, yes, Secretary Clinton does represent the establishment. I represent, I hope, ordinary Americans, and by the way, who are not all that enamored with the establishment, but I am very proud to have people like Keith Ellison and Raul Grijalva in the House, the co-chairmen of the House Progressive Caucus.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~I think as Secretary Clinton knows, there is nobody who fought harder. I was on the House Financial Committee at that time. I heard the arguments coming from Democrats and Republicans&mdash;Robert Rubin, Alan Greenspan&mdash;about great an idea it would be if we did away with Glass-Steagall and if we allowed investor banks and commercial banks and big insurance companies to merge.Go to YouTube today. Look up Greenspan-Sanders. Listen to what I told them then. I helped lead the effort against deregulation. Unfortunately, we lost that. The result is&mdash;was the worst financial disaster since the Great Depression.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~I think President Obama had the right idea, and the bottom line is that of course there have to be conditions. But, of course it doesn't do us any good to not talk with our adversaries
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~I would say that&mdash;that folks who have looked at this issue for a long time, whether it's Elizabeth Warren or many other economists, will tell you that right now, yes, we do need a 21st century Glass-Steagall legislation. And I would tell you also that when you have three out of the four largest banks in America today, bigger than they were&mdash;significantly bigger than when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, a good Republican by the way, what he would say is: Break them up; they are too powerful economically; they are too powerful politically.And that is what I believe and many economists believe. Time to break them up. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~I&mdash;my dad came to this country at the age of 17 from Poland. Didn't have any money, couldn't speak English, he died pretty young, and I think it would have been beyond his wildest dreams to see his son up here on this stage today running for president.I love this country and my dad loved this country, and he was the most proud American because of what it gave him in terms of raising his family, even though we never had much money. But today in America, we are the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people, that doesn't guarantee paid family and medical leave. We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth. We are seeing millions of families unable to send their kids to college in the United States of America.I'm running for president because I believe it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. I do believe we need a political revolution where millions of people stand up and say loudly and clearly that our government belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.Thank you all.

Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Just to set the record straight, I very strongly supported the agreement which makes certain that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Let's
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Let's talk about issues.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Let's talk about&mdash;OK, let's talk
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Let's talk&mdash;let's talk about issues, all right? Let's talk about why, in the 1990s, Wall Street got deregulated. Did it have anything to do with the fact that Wall Street provided&mdash;spent billions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions?Well, some people might think, yeah, that had some influence. [laughter]Let's ask why it is that we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, and your medicine can be doubled tomorrow, and there's nothing that the government can do to stop it.You think it has anything to do with the huge amounts of campaign contributions and lobbying from the fossil fuel industry? Let's talk about climate change.Do you think there's a reason why not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real, and that we need to transform our energy system? Do you think it has anything to do with the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil pouring huge amounts of money into the political system?That is what goes on in America. I am not&mdash;I like [applause] there is a reason. You know, there is a reason why these people are putting huge amounts of money into our political system. And in my view, it is undermining American democracy and it is allowing Congress to represent wealthy campaign contributors and not the working families of this country.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~let's&mdash;let's&mdash;let's talk about issues.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Let me
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Let me agree. You know, as the secretary knows, I chaired&mdash;I had the privilege and the honor of chairing the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. And it is interesting to me, you know, Republicans give a lot of speeches about how much they love veterans. I work with the American Legion, the VFW, the DAV, the Vietnam Vets, and virtually every veterans organization to put together the most comprehensive piece of the veterans legislation in the modern history of America. That's what I did.And I brought it to the floor of the Senate. Every Democrat voted for it, I got two Republicans. We ended up with 56 votes and I couldn't get the 60 votes that I needed. That is pathetic.This was legislation supported by all of the veterans organizations, addressing many of the serious problems that veterans face in health care and in how we deliver benefits to them.So Republicans talk a good game about veterans, but when it came to put money on the line to protect our veterans, frankly, they were not there.What I did next, Rachel, is I had to retreat a little bit, I had to compromise. I did work with John McCain. I did work with Jeff Miller over in the House. And we put together not the bill that I wanted, but probably the most comprehensive V.A. health care bill in the modern history of this country.Secretary Clinton is absolutely right, there are people, Koch brothers among others, who have a group called Concerned Veterans of America, funded by the Koch brothers. The Koch brothers, by the way, want to destroy Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, every governmental program passed since the 1930s. Yes, there are people out there who want to privatize it.The last point that I'd make. I had a hearing. I had all of the veterans groups in front of me. And I said to them, tell me when a veteran gets in to the V.A., understanding there are waiting lines and real problems, when a veteran gets into the system, is the quality of care good?Without exception, what they said, good, excellent, very good. We've got to strengthen the V.A. We do not privatize the V.A. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Let me just pick up on this point. This whole discussion began because I commented, not making overall evaluation about the Secretary. She was in Ohio, I think, in September or November and she got up and said something like, I have been&mdash;I'm paraphrasing, I have been criticized because people think I'm a moderate. Well, I am a moderate.That's where this came from. It wasn't me paraphrasing her. It is what she said, and all that I said was there's nothing wrong with being a moderate. But, you can't be a moderate, you can't a progressive.In terms of President Obama, I think if we remember where this country was seven years ago, 800,000 jobs being lost every month, $1.4 trillion dollar deficit. The world's financial system on the verge of collapse. I think that President Obama, Vice President Biden, and the Democratic leadership in the House and the Senate have done a fantastic job. We are in much better shape than we were seven years ago, although my Republican colleagues seem to have forgotten where we were seven years ago. That's the fact, but, we still have a very long way to go.Do I think President Obama is a progressive? Yes, I do. I disagree with him on a number of issues including the trade agreement. But, yes, I think he has done an excellent job.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Let me just say this. Wall Street is perhaps the most powerful economic and political force in this country. You have companies like Goldman Sachs, who just recently paid a settlement fine with the federal government for $5 billion for defrauding investors.Goldman Sachs was one of those companies whose illegal activity helped destroy our economy and ruin the lives of millions of Americans. But this is what a rigged economy and a corrupt campaign finance system and a broken criminal justice is about. These guys are so powerful that not one of the executives on Wall Street has been charged with anything after paying, in this case of Goldman Sachs, a $5 billion fine.Kid gets caught with marijuana, that kid has a police record. A Wall Street executive destroys the economy, $5 billion settlement with the government, no criminal record. That is what power is about. That is what corruption is about. And that is what has to change in the United States of America. [applause] [crosstalk]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~let us talk about issues.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Look, I hear what the Secretary said, and I understand, but look, there are&mdash;all of us know that we have seen in recent years horrible, horrible crimes. It's hard to imagine how people can do, bomb, and kill 168 people in Oklahoma City, or do the Boston Marathon bombing, but this is what I believe, and for a couple of reasons.Number one, too many innocent people, including minorities, African Americans, have been executed when they were not guilty. That's number one. We have to be very careful about making sure about that.But, second of all, and maybe, in a deeper reason, of course there are barbaric acts out there. But, in a world of so much violence and killing, I just don't believe that government itself should be part of the killing. So, when somebody commits [applause] somebody commits any of these terrible crimes that we have seen, you lock them up, and you toss away the key. They're never going to get out. But, I just don't' want to see government be part of killing. That's all. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~No, I don't. I worry very, very much about an isolated country. That's what makes me nervous. Russia lives in the world. China lives in the world. North Korea is a very, very strange country because it is so isolated, and I do feel that a nation with nuclear weapons, they have got to be dealt with. Dealt with effectively.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~No, let
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~No, no
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~No, not at all. Here's the reality of American economic life today. The reality is that we have one of lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth because so many people have given up on the political process. The reality is that there has been trillions of dollars of wealth going from the middle class in the last 30 years to the top 1/10th of 1 percent. The reality is we that have a corrupt campaign finance system which separates the American people's needs and desires from what Congress is doing. So to my mind, what we have got to do is wage a political revolution where millions of people have given up on the political process, stand up and fight back, demand the government that represents us and not just a handful of campaign contribution&mdash;contributors.Now all of the ideas that I'm talking about, they are not radical ideas. Making public colleges and universities tuition free, that exists in countries all over the world, used to exist in the United States. Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and creating 13 million jobs by doing away with tax loopholes that large corporations now enjoy by putting their money into the Cayman Islands and other tax havens. That is not a radical idea.What we need to do is to stand up to the big money interests, and the campaign contributors. When we do that, we can, in fact, transform America.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Not losing control of our campaign. You know, we have hired a whole lot of people in a rapid way and I am familiar with the first two instances and they are unacceptable, and we have apologized and dealt with that.In terms of the last one, as I understand it, we did not suggest that we had the endorsement of a newspaper. Newspapers who make endorsements also say positive things about other candidates, and to the best of my knowledge, that is what we did. So we never said, never said that somebody, a newspaper endorsed us that did not. What we did say is blah blah blah blah was said by the newspaper.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Of course I can work with them, but let's be clear. When I talked about Boeing and I talked about General Electric, what I was referring to is an outrage. I suspect the secretary agrees request me.Right now you have a loophole such that these guys are putting their profits, multi-billion dollar profitable corporations putting billions of dollars into the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, and other tax havens.And in a given year, Rachel, after making billions of dollars in profit, do you know how much they're paying in taxes to the United States government in a given year? Zero. Now explain to me how that makes any sense at all.So what I have said with regard to Boeing and GE and other multinationals that pay zero taxes, you know what we're going to do? We're going to end that loophole. They are going to pay their fair share of taxes.We're going to use that money to rebuild our infrastructure and create up to 13 million jobs.Can I work with corporations? Are there good corporations doing incredible cutting edge research and development? Absolutely they are. And we should be proud of them.But on the other hand, there are many corporations who have turned their backs on the American worker, who have said, if I can make another nickel in profit by going to China and shutting down in the United States of America, that's what I will do.I will do my best to transform our trade policy and take on these corporations who want to invest in low-income countries around the world rather than in the United States of America. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Oh [inaudible]. [laughter]See, when you are old, then they go back all these years. All right. What have you got?
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~OK.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~OK. Let me agree with much of what the secretary said, but where we have a different background on this issue is we differ on the war in Iraq, which created barbaric organizations like ISIS.Not only did I vote against that war, I helped lead the opposition, and if you go to my website, berniesanders.com, you will see the statement that I made in 2002. And it gives me no pleasure to tell you that much of what I feared would happen the day after Saddam Hussein was overthrown, in fact, did happen.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Rachel, thank you very much.Millions of Americans are giving up on the political process. And they're giving up on the political process because they understand the economy is rigged.They are working longer hours for low wages. They're worried about the future of their kids, and yet almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. Not what America is supposed to be about. Not the fairness that we grew up believing that America was about. And then sustaining that rigged economy is a corrupt campaign finance system undermining American democracy, where billionaire, Wall Street, corporate America can contribute unlimited sums of money into super PACs and into candidates.Our job, together, is to end a rigged economy, create an economy that works for all, and absolutely overturn Citizens United. One person, one vote. That's what American democracy is about.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~That's right, I mean, instead of arguing about definitions, let's talk about
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~this is a good discussion here.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Well
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Well, I agree with the Des Moines Register, but let's not blow this out of proportion. This is not a&mdash;this is not, like, a winner-take-all thing.I think where we now stand&mdash;correct me if I'm wrong&mdash;you have 22 delegates, I have 20 delegates. We need 2,500 delegates to win the nomination. [laughter]You know, so this is not&mdash;this is not the biggest deal in the world. We think, by the way, based on talking to our precinct captains, we may have at least two more delegates.What the Des Moines Register said&mdash;you know, there were coin&mdash;I think there were half a dozen coin flips&mdash;a fairly chaotic type situation. At the end of the day, no matter how it's recounted, it will break roughly even.And by the way, I love and respect the caucus process in Iowa. See, and I don't have to say it, because they voted already. [laughter]And I love New Hampshire, too, because you haven't voted, but [applause] but, look, I think people are blowing this up out of proportion. But I think we need improvements in the process by which results are determined.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Well, I don't see it quite like that.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Well, I haven't quite run for president before. [laughter and applause]Let's deal with some of the comments that Secretary Clinton made. And by the way, you know, sometimes there's a lot of drama here. I have known Secretary Clinton for 25 years and respect her very much.Here is the issue. Every major country on earth, whether it's the U.K., whether it's France, whether it's Canada, has managed to provide healthcare to all people as a right and they are spending significantly less per capita on health care than we are. So I do not accept the belief that the United States of America can't do that.I do not accept the belief that the United States of America and our government can't stand up to the ripoffs of the pharmaceutical industry which charge us by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.Number two, in the economy today, everybody understands that we need a well educated workforce. This is 2016. When we talk about public education, it can no longer be K through 12th grade. I do believe that public colleges and universities should be tuition free. Well, how do we pay for that? It's an expensive proposition.I do believe that we should substantially lower student debt in this country, which is crushing millions of people. We pay for it, in my view, by a tax on Wall Street speculation. The middle class bailed out Wall Street in their time of need. Now, it is Wall Street's time to help the middle class. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Well, I think our great task is to make certain that our young men and women in the military do not get sucked into never- ending, perpetual warfare within the quagmire of Syria and Iraq. And I will do my very best to make sure that that doesn't happen.I agree with the secretary that I think what has to happen&mdash;and let me just mention what King Abdullah of Jordan said. I think he hit the nail on the head.And what he said is essentially the war against ISIS is a war for the soul of Islam. And it must be Muslim troops on the ground that will destroy ISIS, with the support of a coalition of major powers&mdash;U.S., U.K., France, Germany and Russia.So our job is to provide them the military equipment that they need; the air support they need; special forces when appropriate. But at the end of the day for a dozen different reasons, not the least of which is that ISIS would like American combat troops on the ground so they could reach out to the Muslim world and say, "Look, we're taking on those terrible Americans."The combat on the ground must be done by Muslim troops with our support. We must not get involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Well, Rachel, actually, that wasn't accurate. In 1988 the Republican did win, I believe, by 3 points. I came in second. It was 34-31, I think, 19 for the Democrat. In that race the Democrat was the spoiler, not me. And it is true [laughter and applause] it is true, it's not to be denied, I am the longest- serving independent in the history of the United States Congress. People of Vermont sent me to Washington as an independent. That is true.But on the other hand, I have&mdash;when I was in the House for 16 years, I caucused with the Democrats. In the Senate for nine years caucused with the Democrats, of course. And I was elected by the Democrats to be chair of the Veterans Committee three years ago, which I'm very proud of. And now am the rankings member on the Budget Committee, leader of the Democrats in opposition to the majority Republicans.I am running for president as a Democrat. And if elected, not only do I hope to bring forth a major change in national priorities, but let me be frank, I do want to see major changes in the Democratic Party.I want to see working people and young people come into the party in a way that doesn't exist now. And you know what, I want a 50-state strategy so the Democratic Party is not just the party of 25 states. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Well, that's not quite accurate. I did give a speech at Georgetown where I talked about democratic socialism and foreign policy. Maybe I shouldn't have combined the two in the same speech, because the foreign policy part of it didn't get much attention. So, let me take this opportunity to give you a very short speech here on the issue.I think, while it is true that the secretary and I voted differently on the war in Iraq, what is important is that we learn the lesson of the war in Iraq. And that lesson is intrinsic to my foreign policy if elected president, is the United States cannot do it alone. We cannot be the policeman of the world. We are now spending more I believe than the next eight countries on defense. We have got to work in strong coalition with the major powers of the world and with those Muslim countries that are prepared to stand up and take on terrorism.So I would say that the key doctrine of the Sanders administration would be no, we cannot continue to do it alone; we need to work in coalition. [applause] [crosstalk]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Well, we've had a number of economists supporting our legislation. And here's where we are. The American people can judge. Six largest financial institutions in America today have assets of roughly $10 trillion; equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of the United States of America.That is a lot of money. They issue two thirds of the credit cards, and by the way they're ripping off a whole lot of people with high interest rates on the credit cards, and they write about one third of the mortgages.That is a lot of power for six financial institutions. That's it. I think it is too much power. Too much economic power, too much political power, and the economists that I talk to say we should break them up.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Well, you can't simply withdraw tomorrow. Wish we could, and allow, you know, the Taliban or anybody else to reclaim that country. But what we must do, and what we have seen in recent months, is some progress in Iraq, where finally the Iraqi army, which has not been a particularly effective fighting force, retook Ramadi. ISIS has lost I think 40 percent of the territory that it held in the last year.Hopefully, and you know, one can't predict the future, that maybe our training and their fighting capabilities are improving and we are going to make some progress in destroying ISIS.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Well, you know, a general election is different than a primary and caucus process. But let me just say this. In terms of where we are right now, as you mention, Rachel, in a number of national and state, including New Hampshire. For example, the last poll I saw&mdash;there may have been a new one&mdash;last one I saw here in New Hampshire, a battleground state, had me defeating Trump by 19; the secretary defeating him by one. There were also pretty large margins in Iowa and Wisconsin.These are polls. Polls go up. Polls go down. But here's why I think I will be, if nominated, the strongest candidate. Democrats win when there is a large voter turnout; when people are excited; when working people, middle class people and young people are prepared to engage in the political process.Republicans win when people are demoralized and you have a small voter turnout, which by the way is why they love voter suppression. I believe that our campaign up to now has shown that we can create an enormous amount of enthusiasm from working people, from young people, who will get involved in the political process and which will drive us to a very large voter turnout.If there is a large voter turnout, not only do we retain the White House, but I think we regain the Senate. We win governors' chairs up and down the line. So I believe if you want to retain the White House, if you want to see Democrats do well across the board, I think our campaign is the one that creates the large voter turnout and helps us win. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~What  [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~What being part of the establishment is, is, in the last quarter, having a super PAC that raised $15 million from Wall Street, that throughout one's life raised a whole lot of money from the drug companies and other special interests.To my mind, if we do not get a handle on money in politics and the degree to which big money controls the political process in this country, nobody is going to bring about the changes that is needed in this country for the middle class and working families.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~What we should do, and one of the things we should do is not only talk the talk, but walk the walk. I am very proud to be the only candidate up here who does not have a Super PAC, who's not raising huge sums of money from Wall Street [applause]  And special interests. I am enormously proud. Never believed it would happen that we have raised 3.5 million individual contributions, averaging $27 dollars a piece. That is what the political revolution means. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Who said That think we should normalize relations with Iran tomorrow? I never said that. I think we should move forward as quickly as we can.And you're right. They are a sponsor of terrorism around the world and we have to address that. But you know, a number of years ago, people were saying normal relationship with Cuba, what a bad and silly idea. They're Communists, they are our enemy. Well guess what? Change has come.So please don't suggest that I think we normalize relations with Tehran tomorrow. We don't. But I would like to see us move forward, and hopefully some day that will happen. And I would say if I might, Madam Secretary&mdash;and you can correct me if I'm wrong. When you ran against Senator Obama you thought him naive because he thought it was a good idea to talk to our enemies. I think those are exactly the people you have to talk to and you have to negotiate with. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Yeah, I do. I agree with much of what the Secretary said, but, madam Secretary, it is not one streak. Wall Street is an entity of unbelievable economic and political power. That's a fact.And, I want to say something, and it may sound harsh, not to you, but to the American people. In a sense, in my view, the business model of Wall Street is fraud. It's fraud. I believe that corruption is rampant, and the fact that major bank after major bank has reached multi billion dollar settlements with the United States government when we have a weak regulator system tells me that not only did we have to bail them out once, if we don't start breaking them up, we're going to have to bail them out again, and I do not want to see that happen
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~you know
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~&mdash;it will actually raise wages. You have to make all those connections so that you've got people with you every step of the way. That's what I want to do.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~A group of national security experts, military intelligence experts, issued a very concerning statement about Senator Sanders's views on foreign policy and national security, pointing out some of the comments he has made on these issues, such as inviting Iranian troops into Syria to try to resolve the conflict there; putting them right at the doorstep of Israel. Asking Saudi Arabia and Iran to work together, when they can't stand each other and are engaged in a proxy battle right at this moment. So I do think questions have been raised and questions have to be answered because when New Hampshire voters go on Tuesday to cast your vote, you are voting both for a president and a commander in chief. And there is no way to predict what comes in the door of that White House from day to day that can pose a threat to the United States or one of our friends and allies, and I think this is a big part of the job interview that we are all conducting with the voters here.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Absolutely I can. You know, before it was emails, it was Benghazi, and the Republicans were stirring up so much controversy about that. And I testified for 11 hours, answered their questions. They basically said yeah, didn't get her. We tried. That was all a political ploy.Now, we had a development in the email matter today when it came out that Secretary Powell and close aides to Former Secretary Rice used private e-mail accounts. and now you have these people in the government who are doing the same thing to Secretary Powell and Secretary Rice's aide they've been doing to me, which is that I never sent or received any classified material. They are retroactively classifying it.I agree completely with Secretary Powell, who said today this is an absurdity. And so I think the American people will know it's an absurdity. I have absolutely no concerns about it whatsoever. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Absolutely. Absolutely. You know, Rachel, you and I have talked about this before. I thank you for going to Flint to hold that town hall. I will be in Flint at the Mayor's invitation on Sunday to get an in depth briefing about what is, and is not happening.This is an emergency. Everyday that goes by that these people, particularly the children, are not tested so we can know what steps must be taken to try to remediate the effects of the poisoning that they have been living with is a day lost in a child's life. I know from the work that I've done over so many years, lead, the toxic nature of lead can affect you brain development, your body development, your behavior.I absolutely believe that what is being done is not sufficient. We need to be absolutely clear about everything that should be done from today to tomorrow, into the future to try to remedy the terrible burden that the people of Flint are barring. That includes fixing their pipes, it includes guaranteeing whatever healthcare and educational embellishments they may need going forward, and I think the federal government has way where it can bill the state of Michigan. If Michigan won't do it, there have to be ways that we can begin to move, and then make them pay for it, and hold them accountable. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Absolutely. You know, I did put together the coalition to impose sanctions. I actually started the negotiations that led to the nuclear agreement, sending some much my closest aides to begin the conversations with the Iranians.I'm very pleased we got that nuclear agreement. It puts a lid on the nuclear weapons program. We have to enforce it, there have to be consequences attached to it. But that is not our only problem with Iran. We have to figure out how to deal with Iran as the principal state sponsor of terrorism in the world.They are destabilizing governments in the region. They continue to support Hezbollah and Hamas in Lebanon against Israel. A lot of work that we have do is going to be incredibly hard. I'm prepared to do that work, but I believe, just as I did with imposing the sanctions, you have to get action for action.If we were to normalize relations right now, we would remove one of the biggest pieces of leverage we have to try to influence and change Iranian behavior. The president doesn't think we should. I certainly don't think we should. I believe we have to take this step by step to try to reign in Iranian aggression, their support for terrorism and the other bad behavior that can come back and haunt us.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~All right.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~And I have stood up and I have represented my constituents to the best of my abilities, and I'm very proud of that.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~And let's&mdash;let's
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~And so&mdash;let's talk about issues.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~As I&mdash;as I certainly recall, the question was to meet with without conditions. And you're right, I was against that. I was against it then I would be against it now.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~I am 100 percent confident. This is a security review that was requested. It is being carried out. It will be resolved. But I have to add if there's going to be a security review about me, there's going to have to be security reviews about a lot of other people, including Republican office holders, because we've got this absurd situation of retroactive classifications.Honest to goodness, this is&mdash;this just beggars the imagination. So I have absolutely no concerns about it, but we've got to get to the bottom of what's really going on here, and I hope that will happen.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~I can only tell you what I believe, and that is that I am the strongest candidate to take it to the Republicans and win in November. [applause]And I say that with great&mdash;with great respect for the campaign that Senator Sanders has been running. I personally am thrilled at the numbers of people, and particularly young people who are coming to support your campaign. I hope that I will be able to earn their support. They may not support me now, but I support them and we'll work together.But what I'm concerned about is the views of many Democrats who know their states, who know how hard it is to win a general election. And it also will push whoever the nominee is into the spotlight. I've been vetted. There's hardly anything you don't know about me. And I think it's fair to say that whoever is in that position, Senator Sanders or anyone else who might have run, will face the most withering onslaught.So, I think that I am the person who can do all aspects of the job. I think I'm the person best prepared to take the case to the Republicans. And I think that at the end of the day, it's not so much electability. It is who the American people can believe can keep them safe, can get the economy moving again, can get incomes rising, can build on the progressive accomplishments of President Obama.And I think that the coalition that President Obama put together to win twice is a coalition that I can put together and add to. And that's what I'm prepared to  [applause] [crosstalk]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~I don't think you could find any person in political life today who has been subjected to more attacks and had more money spent against her by special interests, among whom you have named a few, than I.And I'm proud of that. You know, when I took on the drug companies and the insurance companies for universal health care coverage, they went after me with a vengeance.Today, you've got hedge fund billionaires aligned with Karl Rove, running ads against me to try to get Democrats to vote for you. I know this game. I'm going to stop this game.But while we're talking about votes, you're the one who voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives in 2000, which contributed to the over-leveraging of Lehman Brothers, which was one of the culprits that brought down the economy.So I don't know&mdash;I'm not impugning your motive because you voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives. People make mistakes and I'm certainly not saying you did it for any kind of financial advantage. What we've got to do as Democrats&mdash;what we've got to do as Democrats is to be united to actually solve these problems. And what I believe is that I have a better track record and a better opportunity to actually get that job done.That's what this election should be about. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~I haven't talked to Secretary Carter, but here's what I would think he's planning. We do have the nuclear weapons agreement with Iran, that's an enforcement consequence, action for action, follow on. We have a plan, we will watch them, we will be vigilant.We do have to worry about North Korea. They continue to develop their nuclear weapons capability, and they're working very hard on their ballistic missile capability.And, I know that some of those plans could very well lead to a missile that might reach Hawaii, if not the West Coast. We do have to try to get the countries in the region to work with us to do everything we can to confine, and constrain them.But, what Secretary Carter is looking at is the constant pressure that Russia's putting on our European allies. The way that Russia is trying to move the boundaries of the post-World War II Europe. The way that he is trying to set European countries against one another, seizing territory, holding it in Crimea. Beginning to explore whether they could make some inroads in the Baltics.We know that they are deeply engaged in supporting Assad because they want to have a place in the Middle East. They have a naval base, they have an air base in Syria. They want to hang on to that. I think what Secretary Carter is seeing, and I'm glad he is, is that we got to get NATO back working for the common defense. We've got to do more to support our partners in NATO, and we have to send a very clear message to Putin that this kind of belligerence, that this kind of testing of boundaries will have to be responded to. The best way to do that is to put more armor in, put more money from the Europeans in so they're actually contributing more to their own defense.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~I never said that.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~I want to reverse Citizens United.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~I will look into it. I don't know the status, but I will certainly look into it. But, I can only repeat what is the fact that I spoke to a lot of different groups with a lot of different constituents, a lot of different kinds of members about issues that had to do with world affairs. I probably described more times than I can remember how stressful it was advising the President about going after Bin Laden.My view on this is look at my record. Look at what I am proposing, and&mdash;we have a vigorous agreement here. We both want to reign in the excesses of Wall Street. I also want to reign in the excesses of Johnson Controls that we bailed out when they were an autoparts company, and we saved the auto industry, and now they want to avoid paying taxes.I want to go after the pharmaceutical companies like Valeant, and Turns that are increasing prices without any regard to the impact on people's health. Now, if all we're going to talk about is one part of our economy, and indeed one streak in our economy, we're missing the big oil companies. We're missing other big energy companies. We're missing the big picture, and I have a record of trying to go at the problems that actually exist, and I will continue to do that.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~I&mdash;I worked hard for McCain-Feingold.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~If I could just follow up on that. [applause]There is no disagreement between us on universal coverage for health care, the disagreement is where do we start from and where do we end up.The Republicans want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I want to improve it. I want to build on it, get the costs down, get prescription drug costs down. Senator Sanders wants us to start all over again. This was a major achievement of President Obama, of our country. It is helping people right now.I am not going to wait and have us plunge back into a contentious national debate that has very little chance of succeeding. Let's make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~If I could&mdash;if I could
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~If I could, let me just say that of course it has to change. It has to change. And that's why I have put forward a plan to do just that. And it's been judged to be the toughest, most effective and comprehensive one.I have great respect for Senator Sanders's commitment to try to restore Glass-Steagall. But I do not believe that that is enough. And in fact, I don't believe it really addresses a lot of the biggest issues we have.You know, we now have power under the Dodd-Frank legislation to break up banks. And I've said I will use that power if they pose a systemic risk. But I want to go further, because it was investment banks, it was insurance companies, it was mortgage companies, all of which contributed.So let's not just be narrowly focused on one part of the problem. We have a lot of issues with corporate power that have to be addressed. My plan takes us further and it would do the job. [crosstalk] [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~If I could, you know, in the very first debate I was asked am I a moderate or a progressive and I said I'm a progressive who likes to get things done. Cherry picking a quote here or there doesn't change my record of having fought for racial justice, having fought for kids rights, having fought the kind of inequities that fueled my interest in service in the first place going back to my days in the Children's Defense Fund.It certainly didn't stop me from taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies. Before it was called Hillarycare&mdash;I mean, before it was called ObamaCare it was called Hillarycare because we took them on, and we weren't successful, but we kept fighting and we got the children's health insurance program. Every step along the way I have stood up, and fought, and have the scars to prove it.So, again [applause] I think it's important that, look, I understand Senator Sanders really trying to distinguish himself. I understand that, that's what you do in campaigns, but at the same time let's not be&mdash;in, I think an unfair way, making an accusation, or making an attack about where I stand and about where I've always stood.It is fair to say, Senator, that in your definition, as you being the self-proclaimed gatekeeper for progressivism, I don't know anyone else who fits that definition, but I know a lot of really hard fighting progressives in the Democratic party who have stood up time, and time again against special interests, against the powerful on behalf of those who are left behind and left out.And, that's what we ought to be celebrating. Let's talk about what we would do as President, and Commander in Chief to make sure the progress continues into the future. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~in recent weeks, and let's talk [booing] let's talk about about the issues. Let's talk about the issues that divide us.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Look
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Look we have a law&mdash;look, you know, I&mdash;I appreciate the senator's advocacy. We have a law. It was passed. It was signed by President Obama. It lays out a process that you go through to determine whether a systemic risk is posed.And by the way, President Obama signed that, pushed it through, even though he took donations from Wall Street, because he's a responsible president. So we have a law in place. If the circumstances warrant it, I will certainly use it. And from what you say, I know you will as well.But that is not enough. And I keep going back to this because part of the reason the Wall Street guys are trying so hard to stop me&mdash;the hedge fund guys, the shadow banking guys&mdash;is because I've got their number on all of that. And my plan goes so much further to try to prevent the problems of the future.You know, we can't just fight the last war. We've got to be prepared to stop these guys if they ever try to use their economic power once again, to hurt the economy, and to hurt so many Americans. And my plan, Paul Krugman, Barney Frank, a lot of experts who understand what the new challenges might be, have said I am exactly on point, and the Wall Street guys actually know that. [applause] [crosstalk]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~No.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~No. I mean, of course that's a theoretical question, and we don't know what it would be for, and we don't know how many numbers there are. I am against American combat troops being in Syria and Iraq.I support special forces. I support trainers. I support the air campaign. And I think we're making some progress. I want to continue to intensify that, and that's exactly what the president is doing.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Oh, absolutely. The president decided to leave more troops than he had originally planned in Afghanistan. We have a very cooperative government there, with Ashraf Ghani and his top&mdash;his top partner, Abdullah. And they are doing their very best. And the Afghan army is actually fighting. The Afghan army is taking heavy losses defending Afghan territory.And I would have to make an evaluation based on the circumstances at the time I took office as to how much help they continue to need. Because it's not just the Taliban. We now are seeing outposts of, you know, fighters claiming to be affiliated with ISIS.So, we've got this arc of instability from North Africa to South Asia, and we have to pay close attention to it. And we have to build coalitions, something that I did to take on the Iranian nuclear program, and what I will do as president to make sure that we defeat these terrorist networks.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~On the issue of Wall Street.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Part of diplomacy, the hard work of diplomacy is trying to extract whatever concessions you can get, and giving something the other side wants. Of course you've got to try to make peace with, and work with those who are your adversaries, but you don't just rush in, open the door, and say, "Here I am. Let's talk and make a deal."That's not the way it works.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~respectfully add&mdash;look, we did differ. A vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS. We have to look at the threats that we face right now [applause] and we have to be prepared to take them on and defeat them.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~So I think it's time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~That's true. That's true. [crosstalk]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~The answer to both of those is no. I'm interested in making what we have work better. I want to streamline programs that are duplicative and redundant. I want to have a top-to-bottom review about what works and what doesn't work, and be absolutely clear we're getting rid of what doesn't work.I have had the opportunity to run a big agency. I was very flattered when Henry Kissinger said I ran the State Department better&mdash;better than anybody had run it in a long time. So I have an idea of what it's going to take to make our government work more efficiently.And when you put together a budget, you have to make a lot of hard decisions, but I think it's not appropriate to say "I'm going to get rid of this, get rid of that" until you have a very good process that gives you the information about what to do.But I want to add something else, you know, because look, we have so much work to do in our country, and I think it's the greatest work that Americans will be called to do. And of course, we have to have people in every community involved in it. We have to have the political voice, the political grassroots speaking up and speaking out about what we have to try to accomplish in Washington.But we also need to have a very clear set of goals that we are going to achieve, and we need to level with the American people about what they are, what they will cost, what will be expected of our citizenry. So I see as president having a constant dialogue with Americans here's what we're trying to get done, here's why I need your help, here's why you may think comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship isn't something you care about, but I'm telling you it will help fix the labor market, it will bring people out of the shadows&mdash;
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~we both agree with campaign finance reform.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Well because I am a progressive who gets things done. And the root of that word, progressive, is progress. But I've heard Senator Sanders comments, and it's really caused me to wonder who's left in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. Under his definition, President Obama is not progressive because he took donations from Wall Street; Vice President Biden is not progressive because she supported Keystone; Senator Shaheen is not progressive because she supports the trade pact. Even the late, great Senator Paul Wellstone would not fit this definition because he voted for DOMA.You know, we have differences and, honestly, I think we should be talk about what we want to do for the country. But if we're going to get into labels, I don't think it was particularly progressive to vote against the Brady Bill five times. [applause]I don't think it was progressive to vote to give gun makers and sellers immunity. I don't think it was progressive to vote against Ted Kennedy's immigration reform. So we could go back and forth like this, but the fact is most people watching tonight want to know what we've done and what we will do. That's why I am laying out a specific agenda that will make more progress, get more jobs with rising incomes, get us to universal health care coverage, get us to universal pre-k, paid family leave and the other elements of what I think will build a strong economy, that will ensure Americans keep making progress. That's what I'm offering and that's what I will do as president. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Well first, thanks to MSNBC and thanks to all of you for holding this debate before the New Hampshire primary. I am going to campaign as hard as I can between now and Tuesday to earn your votes in that primary, and I hear some talk that people are trying to decide do they vote with their heart, do they vote with their head, I'm asking you to bring both your heart and your head to vote with you on Tuesday because we have a lot of work that can only come because your heart is moved.You know, we didn't get to talk about the continuing struggles that Americans face with racism, with sexism, with discrimination against the LGBT community, with new Americans, with people with disabilities. Yes, we have income inequality, we have other forms of inequality that we need to stand up against and absolutely diminish from our society.So I have been moved by my heart ever since I was a young woman about the age of a lot of Senator Sanders' supporters worrying what I can do to make a difference for my country, and I will bring that heart with me, but I will also tell you we've got to get our heads together to come up with the best answers to solve the problems so that people can have real differences in their lives that will make them better for now and into the future. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Well Senator, let me just correct the record if I can. You know&mdash;let me correct the record. [crosstalk]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Well you know, Rachel, I think I may not have done the job I should in explaining my record. You know, I did&mdash;when I left the secretary of State's office, like so many former officials, military leaders, journalists, others, I did go on the speaking circuit. I spoke to heart doctors, I spoke to the American Camping Association, I spoke to auto dealers, and yes, I spoke to firms on Wall Street. They wanted me to talk about the world, what my experience had been as secretary of State.But what I want people to know is I went to Wall Street before the crash. I was the one saying you're going to wreck the economy because of these shenanigans with mortgages. I called to end the carried interest loophole that hedge fund managers enjoy. I proposed changes in CEO compensation.I called for a consumer protection financial bureau before it was created. And I think the best evidence that the Wall Street people at least know where I stand and where I have always stood is because they are trying to beat me in this primary. They have collected and spent as much as $6 million on these ads. Hedge fund billionaires, Karl Rove, another billionaire, jumped in.And why are they doing that? These are guys who try to make smart investments. They know my record, they know me, they know that I say what I believe and I will do it. And I also have a pretty good understanding about how to stop them.So I do want people to know that, and I think it's important for everybody to understand I have a record, I have stood firm and I will be the person who prevents them from ever wrecking the economy again. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Well, Chuck
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Well, first of all, I'm absolutely against privatizing the V.A. And I am going do everything I can to build on the reforms that Senator Sanders and others in Congress have passed to try to fix what's wrong with the V.A.There are a lot of issues about wait times and services that have to be fixed because our veterans deserve nothing but the best.But you're absolutely right, you know, Rachel, this is another part of the Koch brothers agenda. They've actually formed an organization to try to begin to convince Americans we should no longer have guaranteed health care, specialized care for our veterans.I will fight that as hard as I can. I think there's where we can enlist the veterans service organizations, the veterans of America, because, yes, let's fix the V.A., but we will never let it be privatized, and that is a promise. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Well, I'm certainly going to unite the party, but I'm not&mdash;I'm not getting ahead of myself. I think that would be a little bit presumptuous. If I'm so fortunate as to be the nominee, the first person I will call to talk to about where we go and how we get it done will be Senator Sanders. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Well, I'm happy to be here in New Hampshire for this debate, as we move toward the primary on Tuesday.I believe that America has the opportunity to once again live by our values, live up to our values in the 21st century, but I think that America can only do that if Americans can succeed. And there are lots of reasons why Americans today are feeling left out and left behind.Yes, of course, the economy has not been working for most Americans. Yes, of course, we have special interests that are unfortunately doing too much to rig the game.But there's also the continuing challenges of racism, of sexism, of discrimination against the LGBT community, of the way that we treat people as opposed to how we want to be treated.I believe that we can get back on the right track. I want to imagine a country where people's wages reflect their hard work, where we have healthcare for everyone, and where every child gets to live up to his or her potential.I'm fighting for people who cannot wait for those changes, and I'm not making promises that I cannot keep.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Well, I think what the president understands, and what he's trying to do, is that we have to support the Arab and Kurdish fighters on the ground who are actually doing the fighting.I agree with the president. I've said myself, we will not send American combat troops back to either Syria or Iraq&mdash;that is off the table.But we do have special forces, we do have trainers, we do have the military personnel who are helping with the airstrikes that the United States is leading so that we can try to take out ISIS infrastructure, take out their leadership.And I think that, given the threat that ISIS poses to the region and beyond, as we have sadly seen in our own country, it is important to keep the Iraqi army on a path where they can actually take back territory, to work with the Sunni tribes in Anbar province and elsewhere so that their fighters can be also deployed, to work with the Kurds to provide them the support, but they're doing the fighting. We're doing the support and enabling.And I also think we've got to do more to stop foreign fighters, foreign funding and take ISIS on online, as well as doing everything necessary to keep us safe at home.So as I look at what the president it doing, it adds up to me. We just have to keep&mdash;try to get more support for those people on the ground in Syria and Iraq who have to actually physically take the territory back.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Well, I&mdash;I don't accept that premise, Chuck. I think that we've got so much business we have to do. We've talked a lot tonight about what we're against&mdash;we're against income inequality. We're against the abuses of powerful interests. We're against a lot of things.I'm for a lot of things. I don't want to just stop bad things from happening, I want to start good things from happening. And I believe, if I'm so fortunate to get the nomination, I will begin to work immediately on putting together an agenda, beginning to talk with members of Congress and others about how we can push forward.I want to have half a billion more solar panels deployed, the first four years. [applause]I want to have enough clean energy to power every home the next four years. I want us to keep working on the Affordable Care Act, to get not only to 100 percent coverage, but bring down the costs of prescription drugs and out-of-pocket costs.I want to move forward on paid family leave, on early childhood education, I want us to do more for small businesses. [applause]Small businesses have to create most of the jobs, and we're not creating and growing small businesses. I think, if you have a smart agenda, you pick the committees that you know have to begin to work on these various pieces&mdash;because that's the way Congress is set up. You go through different committees, and you really make a big push in the beginning.Immigration reform, economic revitalization with manufacturing, with infrastructure&mdash;we put it out there, and we begin to work on an ambitious, big, bold agenda that will actually produce the results that I want to see for our country.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Well, let me just add that, you know, I've said this before and I'm very proud of it, that when it comes to judgment, having run a hard race against Senator Obama at the time, he turned to me to be secretary of State. And when it comes to the biggest counterterrorism issues that we faced in this administration, namely whether or not to go after bin Laden, I was at that table, I was exercising my judgment to advise the president on what to do, on that, on Iran, on Russia on China, on a whole raft of issues.Because I know from my own experience that you've got to be ready on day one. There is just too much unpredictable threat and danger in the world today, you know, to try to just say wait, I'll get to that when I can. That is just not an acceptable approach.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Well, let me start by saying that Senator Sanders and I share some very big progressive goals. I've been fighting for universal healthcare for many years, and we're now on the path to achieving it. I don't want us to start over again. I think that would be a great mistake, to once again plunge our country into a contentious debate about whether we should have and what kind of system we should have for healthcare.I want to build on the progress we've made; got from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent coverage. And I don't want to rip away the security that people finally have; 18 million people now have healthcare; preexisting conditions are no longer a bar. So we have a difference.I also believe in affordable college, but I don't believe in free college, because every expert that I have talked to says, look, how will you ever control the costs. What I want to do is make sure middle class kids, not Donald Trump's kids, get to be able to afford college. I want to get the economy going again. It's not just enough about what we're against, as important as that is. I have a plan to create new jobs, manufacturing, infrastructure, clean energy jobs that will make us the 21st century clean energy super power. I also want to make sure small businesses can start and grow again.And of course, I believe in raising the minimum wage and equal pay for work. But the numbers just don't add up, from what Senator Sanders has been proposing. That's why all of the independent experts, all of the editorial boards that have vetted both of us have concluded that it is just not achievable.Let's go down a path where we can actually tell people what we will do. A progressive is someone who makes progress. That's what I intend to do.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Well, look, I've got to just jump in here because, honestly, Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president, as exemplifying the establishment. And I've got to tell you that it is [applause] it is really quite amusing to me.People support me because they know me. They know my life's work. They have worked with me and many have also worked with Senator Sanders. And at the end of the day they endorse me because they know I can get things done. [applause]I am not going to make promises I can't keep. I am not going to talk about big ideas like single-payer and then not level with people about how much it will cost. A respected health economist said that these plans would cost a trillion dollars more a year.I'm not going to tell people that I will raise your incomes and not your taxes, and not mean it, because I don't want to see the kind of struggle that the middle class is going through exemplified by these promises that would raise taxes and make it much more difficult for many, many Americans to get ahead and stay ahead. That is not my agenda. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Well, Senator, no one wants to see that happen. I mean, look, I care deeply about this because just like you I have met so many people who had their life savings wiped out, who lost their homes, who are barely back with their heads above water.This was a disaster for our country, and we can never let that happen again. We have no disagreement about this. But, I think it's a broader target list than just Wall Street, and I believe that we have to be very focused on how we try to take back the power and increase the empowerment of the American people. And, I think I have that kind of experience, maybe because they've beat me up for so many years, and I know exactly how to handle them because I've been in the arena with them time and time again.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Well, we set conditions on Iran. We worked hard to get them established, and to be enforced, and then we talked. That's exactly the right [crosstalk] and, that's what I did with the President, so he and I are on the very same page. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Well, you began it yesterday with your comments
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Well, you know, Senator, I don't think&mdash;I don't  [crosstalk] [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Whatever they decide to do, that's fine.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Yeah, but I&mdash;I think it's fair to really ask what's behind that comment. You know, Senator Sanders has said he wants to run a positive campaign. I've tried to keep my disagreements over issues, as it should be.But time and time again, by innuendo, by insinuation, there is this attack that he is putting forth, which really comes down to&mdash;you know, anybody who ever took donations or speaking fees from any interest group has to be bought.And I just absolutely reject that, Senator. And I really don't think these kinds of attacks by insinuation are worthy of you. And enough is enough. If you've got something to say, say it directly.But you will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that I ever received.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~Yes, I do. And&mdash;you know, what I hope the Supreme Court will do is make it absolutely clear that any state that continues capital punishment either must meet the highest standards of evidentiary proof of effective assistance of counsel or they cannot continue it because that, to me, is the real dividing line.I have much more confidence in the federal system, and I do reserve it for particularly heinous crimes in the federal system, like terrorism. I have strong feelings about that. I thought it was appropriate after a very thorough trial that Timothy McVeigh received the death penalty for blowing up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people, including 19 children in a daycare center.I do for very limited, particularly heinous crimes believe it is an appropriate punishment, but I deeply disagree with the way that too many states are still implementing it. If it were possible to separate the federal from the state system by the Supreme Court, that would, I think, be an appropriate outcome.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~You know, Chuck, I've only had responsibility for voting for trade agreements as a senator. And I voted a multinational trade agreement when I was senator, the CAFTA agreement, because I did not believe it was in the best interests of the workers of America, of our incomes, and I opposed it.I did hope that the TPP, negotiated by this administration, would put to rest a lot of the concerns that many people have expressed about trade agreements. And I said that I was holding out that hope that it would be the kind of trade agreement that I was looking for.I waited until it had actually been negotiated because I did want to give the benefit of the doubt to the administration. Once I saw what the outcome was, I opposed it.Now I have a very clear view about this. We have to trade with the rest of the world. We are 5 percent of the world's population. We have to trade with the other 95 percent. And trade has to be reciprocal. That's the way the global economy works.But we have failed to provide the basic safety net support that American workers need in order to be able to compete and win in the global economy. So it's not just what's in the trade agreement that I'm interested in.I did help to renegotiate the trade agreement that we inherited from President Bush with Korea. We go the UAW on board because of changes we made. So there are changes that I believe would make a real difference if they could be achieved, but I do not currently support it as it is written.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Durham, New Hampshire~February 4, 2016~You know, the person who first put out the idea of a 50-state party strategy is former Governor Howard Dean, who is with us tonight. [applause]And I'm very proud and grateful to have the support of so many elected Vermonters and former officials. Two former governors, the current governor, the current other senator. I really appreciate that.And I think it's because they've worked with me, they've seen what I do. They know what kind of a colleague I am. They want me as their partner in the White House. And that's exactly what I will do.We'll get things done together. Democrats, Republicans, independents, we're going to make progress together when I'm president. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Absolutely, I agree. Look, that bill had some sensible provisions in it. It had the banning of bullets that pierce policemen's armor. Is that a good thing? I think we would want to get rid of that. particular legislation had safety locks on guns so the kids do not pick them up and shoot them. That bill had bad things in it. What I have said
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Absolutely. That was a very arbitrary decision. What that real debate was about, as you may or may not know, was about how long it would take for the instant background check to go into effect. I wanted that instant background check to go into effect as soon as possible. That was the most important part of that bill.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~All right, look, Secretary Clinton wants everybody else to release it, well, I'm your Democratic opponent, I release it, here it is. There ain't nothing. I don't give speeches to Wall Street for hundreds of thousands of dollars, you got it.Second of all, when we talk about being tough on Wall Street, and this galls me and the American people. Recently Goldman Sachs, among many other major financial institutions on Wall Street, as you know, reached a settlement with the federal government for $5 billion because they were selling worthless packages of subprime mortgages, $5 billion settlement.You know how many people, executives on Wall Street have gone to jail? If you are a kid caught with marijuana in Michigan, you get a police record. If you are an executive on Wall Street that destroys the American economy, you pay a $5 billion fine, no police record.If I am elected president, we are going to bring justice back to a broken criminal justice system. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~And I voted against Wall Street deregulation.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~And not just the few.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~And that is why, by the way, that is why one of my top priorities, if elected president will be to overturn this outrageous Citizens United Supreme Court [inaudible]. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~And the reason that I was one of the first, not one of the last to be in opposition to the TPP is that American workers [applause] should not be forced to compete against people in Vietnam today making a minimum wage of $0.65 an hour. Look, what we have got to do is tell corporate America that they cannot continue to shut down. We've lost 60,000 factories since 2001. They're going to start having to, if I'm president, invest in this country &mdash; not in China, not in Mexico.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Anderson, not only do we have a crumbling school system in Detroit, and in many other areas, we have &mdash; and everybody in this room should be embarrassed by this, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth. That is a disgrace. [applause]So, when you ask me about my priorities, my priorities are that no, we're not going to give tax breaks to the wealthy. We're going to ask them to start paying their fair share of taxes so we can raise the money to make sure that every child in this country, in Detroit, in Vermont, gets the quality education that he or she deserves. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Anderson, thank you very much.Over the last several weeks I had the opportunity to meet with a number of residents of Flint at a town meeting in Flint, and I have to tell you what I heard, and what I saw literally shattered me. And, it was beyond belief that children in Flint, Michigan in the United States of America in the year 2016 are being poisoned.That is clearly not what this country should be about.As Anderson indicated, there's a lot of blame to go around, and one of the points that I have made is that I believe the Governor of this state should understand that his dereliction of duty was irresponsible. He should resign. [applause]But more importantly, what is happening in Flint to a lesser degree is happening throughout this country. In recent years we have seen a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires, and increase in income and wealth inequality, and all over this country middle class families are struggling. Cities and towns are struggling, in order to provide basic services. Among many other things, we need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our water systems, our waste water plants, our roads and our bridges. The wealthiest country in the history of the world has got to get its priorities right, take care of the people, no more tax breaks for billionaires.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Anderson, the bottom line is, and what my campaign is, is changing our national priorities. We need a government that works for all of us
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~But can I respond to that briefly?
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~But during that same period, '96. There was a bill called &mdash; so-called, it had a long title to it, Welfare Reform Bill. And this bill really was a bill that scapegoated the poorest people in this country. I strongly opposed that legislation. Secretary Clinton had a different position then.And what that legislation ended up doing is increasing extreme poverty, the poorest people in this country have become much poorer as a result of that &mdash; really a bill that was written by Republicans. Bad bill.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Can I &mdash; can I finish, please? All right?And you can &mdash; there are people who hold that view. And that's fine, if you hold it. I think what you do is you hold those people who have used the gun accountable. You try to make
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~guns as safe as possible, but I would disagree on that.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Hold
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Hold it.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~I'll tell you what I say
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~I'll tell you what I say. Do you know what the other name of the Export-Import Bank is? What it's called in Washington? It's called the bank of Boeing because Boeing itself gets 40 percent of the money discharged by the Export-Import Bank.Seventy-Five percent of the funds going from the federal government, the Export-Import Bank, goes to large, profitable corporations. Many of these corporations have shut down in America, and have gone abroad to exploit poor people.You know what? I don't think it's a great idea for the American taxpayer to have to subsidize through corporate welfare profitable corporations who downsize in the United States of America.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~I am very glad, Anderson, that secretary Clinton discovered religion on this issue but it's a little bit too late.Secretary Clinton supported virtually every one of the disastrous trade agreements written by corporate America. [applause]NAFTA, supported by the Secretary cost, us 800,000 jobs nationwide, tens of thousands of jobs in the Midwest. Permanent normal trade relations with China cost us millions of jobs. Look, I was on a picket line in early 1990's against NFATA because you didn't need a PhD in economics to understand that American workers should not be forced to compete against people in Mexico making 25 cents an hour. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~I believe that the recklessness, the greed, and the illegal behavior of Wall Street drove this country into the worst economic downturn in the history of the United &mdash; modern history of the United States of America. And I will be damned if it was the working people of this country who had to bail out the crooks on Wall Street. [applause]And what I proposed &mdash; and I had an amendment that was defeated &mdash; it was defeated by a voice vote on the floor of the Senate &mdash; that said to those people on the top who benefited from Wall Street greed &mdash; I said, "you pay for the bailout. Don't go to my constituents, who are struggling to make ends meet."In terms of the auto bailout, of course that made sense. In terms of the stimulus package, of course that made sense, and I strongly supported President Obama's position on that. But let us be clear, one of the major issues Secretary Clinton says I'm a one-issue person, well, I guess so. My one issue is trying to rebuild a disappearing middle class. That's my one issue. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~I remember President Obama being on television maybe three months ago. Showed the secretary members as well. She knows the president, I know the president. And he is generally speaking in public and he's not a very emotional guy. And he &mdash; after the mass killing in Oregon if my memory is correct, he said look. There &mdash; to be honest with you, let's be honest. Nobody has a magic solution to this problem.Any lunatic tomorrow, any person can walk into a theater and do something horrific. And you know what? For us to tell you that that absolutely will not happen would be untrue. But what the president said, he said look, this is a tough issue. But we have got to do everything we possibly can to minimize the possibility of these mass killings.You are looking at a guy who comes from a rural state with no gun control. I have a D minus voting record from the NRA. You are looking at a guy who in 1988 lost a statewide election for Congress because I was the only candidate who said you know what, I don't think it's a great idea in this country to be selling military-style assault weapons which are designed to kill people. [applause]I lost that election by three votes. I agree with what the secretary said. We need to expand and improve the instant background checks. Bottom line is people who should not have guns in America should not be able to buy guns in America.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~I voted against those trade agreements.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~I want well trained, well paid, child care workers to give our youngest kids advance opportunities.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~I will make a personal promise to you that the EPA and the EPA director that I appoint will make sure that every water system in the United States of America is tested, and that the people of those communities know the quality of the water that they are drinking, and that we are gonna have a plan to rebuild water systems in this country that are unsafe for drinking.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~If I understand &mdash; and &mdash; you know, as I understand it, what you're really talking about is not what Secretary Clinton is responding to.As I understand it &mdash; and maybe I'm wrong on this, but what you were essentially saying, and what people are saying, is that, if somebody who is crazy or a criminal or a horrible person goes around shooting people, the manufacturer of that gun should be held liable.And if that is your position, then what you are saying, essentially &mdash; if that is the case, as I understand it &mdash; it's not what Secretary Clinton is talking about. I agree with what she said.But if that is the case, then essentially, your position is there should not be any guns in America, period. [crosstalk]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Isn't it tragic that the large multinational corporations making billions of dollars a year, shutting down in America, going to China, going to Mexico? Absolutely they need a handout from the American middle class &mdash; I don't think so.Second of all. [applause]Second of all, secretary Clinton traveled the world, she has been to Europe. And let's talk about Europe versus the United States. I'm sure that when you were in Europe, and France, and Germany and the U.K., and all of the other countries; you noticed something and that is every one of those countries guarantees health care to all of their people as a right. [applause]And I am sure you know as you know you do that in countries like the U.K. compared to America, we are spending almost three times as much as they spend in the U.K. for health care for our people. We are spending 50 percent more than the French. When we talk about Europe and their pluses and minuses, one thing they have done well that we should emulate and that is guaranteed health care for all people for a better care for all.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~It's not a question of being better than President Obama, it is a question of building on the work that President Obama has done, the very important work. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Just in this. I am not sure which legislation that was. But I think it may have been the Welfare Reform, so-called
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Let me just say this, while we are on Wall Street, one of us has a super PAC. One of us has raised $15 million from Wall Street for that super PAC. One of us has given speeches on Wall Street for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Now, I kind of think if you get paid a couple hundred thousand dollars for a speech, it must be a great speech. I think we should release it and let the American people see what that transcript was. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Let me tell my story. You tell yours.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~My answer &mdash; my answer is a lot shorter. No, I do not support fracking. [applause]And by the way &mdash; by the way, Anderson, I'm glad you raised the issue of climate change, because the media doesn't talk enough about what the scientists are telling us, and that is, if we don't get our act together [applause] the planet that we're gonna leave our children may not be healthy and habitable. I have introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation in the history of the Senate, which, among other things, calls for a tax on carbon, massive investments [applause] in energy efficiency, wind, solar and other sustainable energy.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~My father came to this country at the age of 17 without any money. Never made any money. We lived in a three and half room rent-controlled apartment. So I learned about economics, not just in college, but in living in a family that didn't have money that had to scrape by. We are here tonight in Flint, Michigan, because a horrendous tragedy is taking place.But it's not just in Flint, Michigan. We are have 29 million people who have no health insurance. We're the only major country on earth that doesn't provide paid family and medical leave. We have school systems around America that are collapsing. And yet we are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. But most people don't know that because almost all of the new incoming wealth is going to the top one percent.I believe, and with all due respect to my good friend, Secretary Clinton, that it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. It is too late for a corrupt campaign finance system and super-PACs that raise enormous amounts of money from special interests.We need in this country a political revolution where ordinary people stand up and reclaim the government that men and women fought and died for. Thank you. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~No, well, he has given us a good, good basis and foundation. We have got to do better than that. And of course we should.But here's what I would do. I would end &mdash; I would make sure that the Department of Justice investigated every killing of a citizen of this country when they are under apprehension from a police officer or when they are killed in police custody.I would end the militarization of local police departments. [applause]I would develop model programs to make police departments look like the communities that they serve. I would end minimal sentencing and give judges more discretion. I would recognize that substance abuse and drug addiction is a health issue, not a criminal issue. [applause]And I would make sure that those people who left jail had the education and job training so they don't go back into the same environment which got them in jail in the first place. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~No, what I am suggesting is that we have a corrupt campaign finance system. And instead of standing up to that finance system  [applause]And instead of standing up to that finance system, Secretary Clinton has super PAC, which is raising huge amounts &mdash; well, I hate to say the word "huge," every time I say huge it [laughter]A lot of money from Wall Street and from the fossil fuel industry. I am doing it a different way. I have 5 million individual contributors who have gone to BernieSanders.com to make a $27 contribution. I don't take money from the fossil fuel industry. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~No. I am very proud to be Jewish, and being Jewish is so much of what I am.Look, my father's family was wiped out by Hitler in the Holocaust. I know about what crazy and radical, and extremist politics mean. I learned that lesson as a tiny, tiny child when my mother would take me shopping, and we would see people working in stores who had numbers on their arms because they were in Hitler's concentration camp.I am very proud of being Jewish, and that is an essential part of who I am as a human being. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~not just wealthy campaign contributors.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Oh, it was the crime bill.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~President Sanders would fire anybody who knew about what was happening and did not act appropriately. [applause]And President Sanders would make the point that, how does it happen, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world? What are our priorities when, among others, Republicans today are fighting for hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the wealthiest people?How did we have so much money available to go to war in Iraq and spend trillions of dollars [applause] but somehow not have enough money &mdash; not just for Flint, the secretary is right. There are communities all over this country &mdash; it's not just infrastructure, it is education. Detroit's public school system is collapsing. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Probably will.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Secretary Clinton is right. In the 1990s, we created a whole lot of jobs. Good. And I supported many of your husband's initiatives. But in the 1990s, you know what we also did? We deregulated Wall Street, which allowed Wall Street to end up destroying our economy. [applause]We passed NAFTA and other disastrous trade agreements which had a horrendous impact on African-Americans in particular, in Flint, in Detroit and all across this country. So when we talk about the '90s, you're right. A lot of good things happened, but a lot of bad things happened.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Seventy-Five percent of that money goes to large profitable corporations.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~So let's say this. Let's say this.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~That's a good point, Anderson.Listen, I suppose they can trust the corporations who have destroyed Flint by a disastrous trade policy which have allowed them to shut down plants in flint and move to China or Mexico. We could trust them I'm sure. [applause]Or maybe &mdash; you know, maybe, Anderson, tell you what &mdash; we should &mdash; maybe we should let Wall Street come in and run the city of Flint [applause] because we know their honesty and integrity has done so much for the American people. Look, we live in a democracy, and I'm not in the last person to deny that government is failing in many respects.But at the end of the day, I will trust the people to create a government that works for them, rather than Wall Street or corporate America. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~That's what we need all over this country.And, let me be very honest with you, hard thing to say, but it is true. A great nation is judged not by how many millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how it treats the most vulnerable amongst us, and that is the children, and that is the elderly. And, do you know what?We should be ashamed of how we treat our kids and our senior citizens.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~That was one of the nice things that he said about me. [laughter]I'll tell you something, this is my right arm. I'm prepared to give &mdash; no, I shouldn't say that. I would love to run against Donald Trump, and I'll tell you why.For a start, but almost &mdash; not all, but almost every poll has shown that Sanders versus Trump does a lot better than Clinton versus Trump. [applause]Right here in Michigan there was a poll done, I think yesterday, or today, had me beating Trump in Michigan by 22 points. [applause]Secretary Clinton beat him as well, but not by so much. And, that's true nationally, and in many other states. And, the other reason I think we can beat Trump is that our campaign is generating an enormous amount of excitement. Just in the last two days we have won the caucuses in Maine, we won that tonight with a very large turnout. [applause and cheering]We won Nebraska, we won Kansas, and Kansas was the biggest turnout in their caucus history.I think we are exciting working class people, young people who are prepared to stand up and demand that we have a government that represents all of us.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~This is a crisis we have got to deal with now.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~through &mdash; excuse me, I'm talking.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Wait a minute. Wait. Could I finish? You'll have your turn, all right?But ultimately, if you look at our records, I stood up to corporate America time and time again. I went to Mexico. I saw the lives of people who were working in American factories and making $0.25 an hour.I understood that these trade agreements were going to destroy the middle class of this country. I led the fight against us. That is one of the major differences that we have.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~We have a Republican leadership in congress now fighting for hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the top two-tenths of one percent, but somehow we can't come up with the money to fix Detroit's crumbling public school system. Somehow we cannot make sure that Detroit has qualified, and good teachers.Somehow we can't make sure that there are summer programs for your children, and after school programs for your children. Somehow we cannot do what other countries around the world, is provide quality childcare and pre-K. We have got to change our national priorities, no more tax breaks for billionaires, and large corporations.We are going to invest in our children, and have the best public school system in the world.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, first of all, that's not quite accurate. I was here long before that. I will you what I did. What I did was meet very quietly in Detroit with parents and others who were impacted by this disaster.And the second thing I did is hold a town meeting, which was as nonpolitical as I could make it for hundreds of people to tell me and the world through the media exactly what was happening here in Flint. I think the fear and the legitimate fear of the people of Flint is that a certain point the TV cameras and CNN will disappear. [applause]And people are going to be left struggling in order to live in a safe and healthy community. All I can say is if you check my record going back a long time, I have stood with those who are hurting. I have stood with those who have no money, and I have taken on virtually every powerful special interest in the United States of America. That's my record and I'm proud of it.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, Hillary Clinton, and everybody else who supported these disastrous trade policies. She wasn't alone. We have many, many Republicans and far too many Democrats who supported these disastrous trade policies.Do you know [applause]  Do you know that in 1960 Detroit Michigan was one of the wealthiest cities in America? Flint, Michigan was a prosperous city, but then what happened is corporate America said why do I want to pay somebody in Michigan a living wage when I can pay slave wages in Mexico or China? We're going to shut down, we're going to move abroad, we're going to bring those products back into this country.Those trade policies, as much as any other set of policies, has resulted in the shrinking of the American middle class. And, I'll tell you what else it did. It's not only job loss by the millions, it is the race to the bottom so that new jobs in manufacturing, in some cases today, pay 50 percent less than they did 20 years ago. How stupid is that trade policy? [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, I'm blaming the trade policies. You know what? This is an amazing thing which I didn't know until recently, and I wonder how many people did know this.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, I &mdash; If you are talking about the Wall Street bailout, where some of your friends destroyed this economy
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, I agree, you know? We can't sit up here &mdash; I can't sit up here and make judgment over whether or not somebody committed a criminal act. But, I will tell you this that after an investigation, if people, in fact, were found to have committed a criminal act &mdash; I talked to a mother.Imagine this for a second, imagine a mother who had a bright seven-year-old gregarious girl doing well in school. Two years later, that child is now in special education, intellectual capabilities significantly deteriorated. That is a crime against that child, and the people of Flint. And, clearly, people are going to have to be held accountable. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, I think &mdash; well, the answer is yes, and I think when we talk about God whether it is Christianity, or Judaism, or Islam, or Buddhism, what we are talking about is what all religions hold dear. And, that is to do unto others as you would like them to do unto you. [applause]I am here tonight, and I'm running for president. I'm a United States Senator from my great state of Vermont because I believe that, because I believe morally and ethically we do not have a right to turn our backs on children in Flint, Michigan who are being poisoned, or veterans who are sleeping out on the street. [applause]What I believe as the father of seven beautiful grandchildren, I want you to worry about my grandchildren, and I promise you I will worry about your family. We are in this together. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, I think the best answer &mdash; I don't know that I can give you a definitive answer here, but I will give you this answer. When I was a young man at the University of Chicago, I worked with fellow black and white students trying to desegregate the University of Chicago owned housing. Most candidates for president, don't put this on their resume, but I was arrested by the Chicago police for trying to desegregate the Chicago school system. [applause]In 1963, and an important day for me, I went to the march on Washington led by Dr. King for jobs and freedom. Dr. King has been an important inspiration for me. In this campaign, if you go toberniesanders.com and read our position on criminal justice, it is I believe the strongest position of any candidate. What it says among other things, 51 percent of African-American kids today are unemployed &mdash; you know we're going to do? We're going to provide education and jobs for those kids, not jails or incarceration.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, let's begin by discussing the problem. As you've indicated, the American Society of Civil Engineers say we need trillions of dollars &mdash; trillions of dollars &mdash; just to bring up our infrastructure to deal with &mdash; water systems like Flint, just to bring them up to decent levels.We have suggested a trillion-dollar investment. Now, you know how we're gonna pay for that? I'll tell you how we're gonna pay for that. Right now, this country is losing $100 billion every single year because profitable corporations are stashing their profits in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda and in other tax havens [applause] and in some cases, not paying five cents in federal income tax. I will eliminate that outrageous loophole, and we will raise $1 trillion. And by the way, not only do we rebuild our crumbling infrastructure &mdash; $1 trillion over five years creates 13 million decent-paying jobs.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, let me just very briefly tell you a story. When I was in one of my first years in Congress, I went to a meeting downtown in Washington, D.C. And I went there with another congressman, an African-American congressman. And then we kind of separated during the meeting. And then I saw him out later on. And he was sitting there waiting and I said, well, let's go out and get a cab. How come you didn't go out and get a cab?He said, no, I don't get cabs in Washington, D.C. This was 20 years ago. Because he was humiliated by the fact that cabdrivers would go past him because he was black. I couldn't believe, you know, you just sit there and you say, this man did not take a cab 20 years ago in Washington, D.C. Tell you another story, I was with young people active in the Black Lives Matter movement. A young lady comes up to me and she says, you don't understand what police do in certain black communities. You don't understand the degree to which we are terrorized, and I'm not just talking about the horrible shootings that we have seen, which have got to end and we've got to hold police officers accountable, I'm just talking about every day activities where police officers are bullying people.So to answer your question, I would say, and I think it's similar to what the secretary said, when you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto. You don't know what it's like to be poor. You don't know what it's like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car.And I believe that as a nation in the year 2016, we must be firm in making it clear. We will end institutional racism and reform a broken criminal justice system. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, let me make a couple of responses. Let me pick up on the last point the secretary made. You know, we are, if elected president, going to invest a lot of money into mental health. And when you watch these Republican debates, you know why we need to invest in that. [laughter and applause]But here's the difference. Here is the difference. It's not a personal difference. We just do things differently. All right. I honestly &mdash; look, we have a corrupt campaign finance system. And what Secretary Clinton is saying and what every candidate who receives from the fossil fuel industry or the drug companies or Wall Street say, not going to impact me.The question the American people have to ask is, why are these people putting millions of dollars into candidates if it's not going to make a difference? [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, let me tell you, I don't want to break the bad news. [laughter]Democrats are not always right. Democrats have often supported corporate welfare [applause] Democrats have supported disastrous trade agreements, but on this issue I do not believe in corporate welfare, and in fact, secretary Clinton may know or not know, but as a member of the Financial Services Committee, I worked hard and successfully to make sure that at least 20 percent of the money went to small businesses which is where it should go and not to profitable corporations and downsizing in our country.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, thank you very much for not being resigned to that horrendous situation, but being prepared to stand up and fight back
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, this is what I say, if I understand it &mdash; and correct me if I'm wrong. If you go to a gun store and you legally purchase a gun, and then, three days later, if you go out and start killing people, is the point of this lawsuit to hold the gun shop owner or the manufacturer of that gun liable?If that is the point, I have to tell you I disagree. I disagree because you hold people &mdash; in terms of this liability thing, where you hold manufacturers' liability is if they understand that they're selling guns into an area that &mdash; it's getting into the hands of criminals, of course they should be held liable.But if they are selling a product to a person who buys it legally, what you're really talking about is ending gun manufacturing in America. I don't agree with that.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~What is going is a disgrace beyond belief. As the president of the United States, this is what I would do is if local government does not have the resources &mdash; if state government for whatever reason America shouldn't be poisoned, federal government comes in, federal government acts. [applause]What is absolute incredible to me is that water rates have soared in Flint. You are paying three times more for poison water than I am paying in Burlington, Vermont for clean water.First thing is you say, people are not paying a water bill for poison and that is retroactive. [applause]Second of all, to ease anxiety, CDC has to come in and examine every child and adult in this community in terms of the amount of lead they may have. Thirdly, the wealthiest country has to rebuild the crumbling infrastructure, our water systems. I have a bill for a trillion dollars, it creates 13 million jobs rebuilding flint, Michigan and communities all over the country.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~What our campaign is about, is asking people to think big not small. And when we think big and we talk about education, we've got to ask ourselves a simple question, how is it &mdash; starting at college that hundreds of thousands of bright young people are today, unable to go to college because they can't afford it? How is it that maybe your kid &mdash; and when I was growing up, we didn't have any money &mdash; we're not even dreaming about going to college because they knew it was another world.So starting with the top, now I know some people think it's a radical idea, I don't. I believe that every public college and university in this country should be tuition free. [applause]So that your child regardless of the income of your family knows that if she's studies hard, she is going to be able to go to college. And you know what else we do? We invest in child care. Right now, you've got child-care workers making McDonald's wages, that is crazy.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Yes. [applause]You know &mdash; you know, one of the differences &mdash; look, Secretary Clinton &mdash; and I've said this before, and I admit it &mdash; she has the support of all the governors &mdash; Democratic &mdash; all the Senators, all the Congressmen. I don't. I am not part of that establishment. I plead guilty. [applause]I happen to be a member of the Environmental Committee. I have talked to scientists all over the world. And what they are telling me &mdash; if we don't get our act together, this planet could be 5 to 10 degrees warmer by the end of this century &mdash; cataclysmic problems for this planet.This is a national crisis. And I talk to scientists who tell me that fracking is doing terrible things to water systems all over this country. We have gotta be bold now. We gotta transform our energy system to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. We've gotta do it yesterday.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~You are not talking about me, are you? [laughter]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~You know, as I think Secretary Clinton knows, as we all know, there are bills in congress that have bad stuff, there are bills in congress that have good stuff. Good stuff and bad stuff in the same bill.Now, if I have voted against that bill, Secretary Clinton would be here tonight and she'd say, "Bernie Sanders voted against the ban on assault weapons. Bernie Sanders voted against the violence against women act." Those were provisions in the bill, as the Secretary just indicated. So, in that bill there was some good provisions, I have been a fierce fighter against domestic violence ever since I was mayor in Burlington.Violence against women act has protected millions of women in this country, it was in that bill. The ban on assault weapons, that's what I have fought for my whole life. It was in that bill.Now, what you are reading though is I went to the floor, as I recall, and that's what I said. I tried to get the death penalty aspects in that bill out. Secretary Clinton have a disagreement. I was then, and I am now opposed to the death penalty. [applause]So, to answer your question, what you read was a congressman who was torn, who said there are good things in that bill, there are bad things overall. I voted for it.But where we are right now is having more than 2.2 million people in jail &mdash; more than any other country on earth. This is a campaign promise, at the end of my first term, we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~You know, I think it is a little bit &mdash; it is a little bit &mdash; look, what happened at Sandy Hook, what happened in Michigan, what has happened far too often all over this country is a terrible, terrible tragedy, and we have got to do everything we can, as I mentioned a moment ago, to end these mass killings.But, as I understand what your question is &mdash; and, you're not the only person whose heart was broken. I know, I was there in the Senate when we learned about this killing. It is almost unspeakable to talk about some lunatic walking into a &mdash; I mean; it is hard to even talk about it.We all feel that way. But it, as I understand it, Anderson, and maybe I'm wrong, what you're really talking about is people saying let's end gun manufacturing in America. That's the implications of that, and I don't agree with that.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Your story is for &mdash; voting for every disastrous trade agreement, and voting for corporate America. Did I vote against the Wall Street bailout?When billionaires on Wall Street destroyed this economy, they went to Congress and they said, "please, we'll be good boys, bail us out." You know what I said? I said, "let the billionaires themselves bail out Wall Street." It shouldn't be the middle class of this country. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Along came George W. Bush and trickle down economics and brought us the Great Recession, which thank goodness President Obama has been digging us out of ever since.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~And
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~And I have said and I will say again, I will be happy to release anything I have as long as everybody else does too, because what really is behind that question, Republicans and Democrats, is where I can stand up to Wall Street.Well, let's have some facts instead of some rhetoric for a change. I went to Wall Street when I was a United States senator. I told them they were wrecking the economy. I asked for a moratorium on foreclosures. I asked that we do more to try to prevent what I worried was going to happen. I also called for closing loopholes including the carried interest loophole. I also called for changes in CEO pay. I have a record. And you know what, if you were going to be in some way distrusted or dismissed about whether you can take on Wall Street if you ever took money, President Obama took more money from Wall Street in the 2008 campaign than anybody ever had.And when it came time to stand up to Wall Street, he passed and signed the toughest regulation since the Great Depression with the Dodd-Frank regulations.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~and that's what I will do as president
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~And that is one of the many reasons we must all support President Obama's right to nominate a successor to Justice Scalia and demand that the Senate hold hearings and a vote on that successor because there are so many issues at stake. On the first day of my campaign, I said, we are going to reverse Citizens United. And if we can't get it done through the court, I will lead a constitutional amendment effort to reverse it that way. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~And the best way to do that is to go right at the people
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~And there has got to be a way to have more warning signals and more efforts to try to stop that from happening like with the man who shot your daughter.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~and they're held responsible.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~and they basically went to the Congress &mdash; I was there.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~and they sell products all the time that cause harm  [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~And, we'll get to what we need to do to help the children and the people when I have a little more time because that's just as important as fixing the pipes.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Anderson, I just want to finish, because this &mdash; I know some of the parents from Sandy Hook. I want people in this audience to think about what it must feel like to send off your first grader, little backpack, maybe, on his or her back, and then the next thing you hear is that somebody has come to that school using an automatic weapon, an AR-15, and murdered those children.Now, they are trying to prevent that from happening to any other family.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Crime bill.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~I'm going to do what I think will work which is both carrots and sticks. Let me talk about the carrots. We're going to have a very clear set of proposals and incentives for manufacturing so that we change the way that companies think about making investments again in America. I have a comprehensive manufacturing plan that I will be implementing.We're also going to invest more on infrastructure as we both have said, "it's woefully under resourced." That will put a lot of people to work. I want to do more to help small businesses, they are the source of two thirds of our jobs and we have to help them start and grow, particularly minority and women-owned small businesses.We need to do more to help create clean energy as a source of good jobs but I am also going to go after companies. You know, when a company decides to leave like Nabisco is leaving and they have gotten tax benefits from Chicago and Illinois to stay there, I will claw back the benefits. They will have to pay them back if they are leaving a place that actually invested in them.I am also going to go after companies like Johnson Controls in Wisconsin. They came and got part of the bailout because they were an auto parts supplier and now they want to move headquarters to Europe. They are going to have to pay an exit fee. We are going to stop this kind of job exporting and we are going to start importing and growing jobs again in our country.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~I don't &mdash; well, I don't know how high it goes. I would certainly be launching an investigation. I think there is one. I was told that &mdash; you know, some of the higher-ups were pushing to get changes that were not happening.So I would have a full investigation, determine who knew what, when. And yes, people should be fired. How far up it went, I don't know. But as far as it goes, they should be relieved, because they failed this city.But let me just add this, Anderson. This is not the only place where this kind of action is needed. We have a lot of communities right now in our country where the level of toxins in the water, including lead, are way above what anybody should tolerate. [applause]We have a higher rate of tested lead in people in Cleveland than in Flint. So I'm not satisfied with just doing everything we must do for Flint. I want to tackle this problem across the board. And if people know about it and they're not acting, and they're in the government at any level, they should be forced to resign.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~I don't have any comment. I don't know that. I don't believe that there is any reason to be concerned about it. I admire what Senator Sanders has accomplished in his campaign. I have more than 850,000 donors, most of them give less than $100. I am very proud of that.And I just want to make one point. You know, we have our differences. And we get into vigorous debate about issues, but compare the substance of this debate with what you saw on the Republican stage last week. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~I just said that. He said at the NAACP that there were some aspects that worked well. The violence against women provisions have worked well, for example. But, other aspects of it were a mistake and I agree. That's why I'm focused, and have a very comprehensive approach toward fixing the criminal justice system, going after systemic racism that stalks the criminal justice system, ending private prisons, ending the incarceration of low-level offenders, and I am committed to doing that. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~I was in the Senate. And they said, "give us absolute immunity." No other industry in America has absolute immunity [crosstalk]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~I will tell you what, Anderson, after I investigated it, I concluded they did and here's why. There two big plane manufacturers in the world, there's Airbus and Boeing. Airbus does everything it can to get contracts to sell planes everywhere in the world. We don't have as quite an aggressive outreach from our government.I did go in many places around the world to sell American products because the alternatives were usually European, Asian, primarily Chinese products. That to me was an unacceptable concession. So yes, Boeing and other big companies get support just like their competitors do from the companies that they are from in the countries that provide the support.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~I will.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~If you're gonna talk, tell the whole story, Senator Sanders.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~including Detroit.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Let me go answer Mr. Mcghee's question because I think it's a profound one.I think the most important that happened to me was a combination of my church and youth minister when I was a teenager, insisting that we go in to inner-city Chicago because I lived in a suburb and have exchanges with kids in black and hispanic churches. It was also important for me to be a baby-sitter for the children of migrant workers and to learn more about their lives, and to hear Dr. King speak in Chicago when I was about 14 years old. That got me thinking about what I needed to do to try to fulfill my faith.When I was in law school, I had the opportunity to mead a visionary woman, named Mary Right Adelman, who worked with Dr. King who was the first African-American woman who passed the Mississippi bar. I asked her for a job and she said she didn't have any money. I was working my way through law school and she said if I could get a job and get myself paid, she would give me a job. So I got law students a Civil Rights Research Council Grant.The first thing she did was send me to look at South Carolina, to investigate juveniles being sent to adult jails. The second thing she did was to send me to Alabama to investigate segregated academies. So from that moment until today, I am so grateful for my experiences as a very young woman driven by my church and my experiences working for the Children's Defense Fund which have given me some insight and have lit a fire inside me to do everything I can to address systemic racism.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Mrs. Kim, here is what I would do as president. Number one, I would reinstate a program we did have during the 1990's where the federal government provided funding to repair and modernize public schools because a lot of communities can't afford to do that on their own. [applause]Secondly, I would use every legal means at my disposal to try to force the Governor and the state to return the schools to the people of Detroit &mdash; to end the emergency management [applause and cheering] which, I believe, if you look at the data, the situation has only gotten worse with these emergency managers that have put the system further in debt. [applause]Number three, I want to set-up inside the Department of Education, for want of a better term, kind of an education SWAT team, if you will. Where we've got qualified people, teachers, principals, maybe folks who are retired, maybe folks who are active, but all of whom are willing to come and help. When Detroit gets back their schools, they should have all the help they can get to be able to get teachers in the classroom, to be able to find spaces while schools are being repaired. And, I also would look at how we could through the federal government support more teachers because we're going to have a teacher shortage in some of the hardest to teach districts  [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~No, it was the crime bill.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~OK, so
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~So we're going to have to do even more here than we would do in most other counties.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~That has, unfortunately, been in many ways, moved to a lower priority. I will elevate it, and I will do everything I can. Water, soil, and paint
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~That is like the NRA position. No.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~That means we have to limit mandatory minimums, we have to end disparities and treatment at last through incarceration
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~The gun manufacturers sell guns to make as much money as they can make. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~We're going to get rid of it. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~We are on the path to doing that thanks to President Obama and the Affordable Care Act, we have 90 percent coverage. We are lacking 10 percent. We are going to stay on that and get to 100 percent universal coverage.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well &mdash; well, I'll tell you something else that Senator Sanders was against. He was against the auto bailout. In January of 2009, President-Elect Obama asked everybody in the Congress to vote for the bailout.The money was there, and had to be released in order to save the American auto industry and four million jobs, and to begin the restructuring. We had the best year that the auto industry has had in a long time. I voted to save the auto industry. [applause]He voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry. I think that is a pretty big difference.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well Nikki, it's a very fair question.Your government at all levels have let you and your children and the people of Flint down. So I think that there are there several things. All the repair work that is being done &mdash; and Mayor Weaver program that we support to begin to help train people in Flint to be able to do this work to distribute the water. Everything that is done has to be triple checked to regain your trust and to hold those who are responsible for fixing the pipes and delivering the clean water which has you said, you bathe in it and drink it and wash food in it. You do everything with it.Every one of us should have to run through in our minds how we use water every single day to understand the pressures and the real pain that families are going through. So I will make sure as President that I double and triple check. I will work with elected officials who I trust like your mayor and like your senators and member of Congress so that we can assure you that when it's fixed, you can trust it. You deserve nothing less.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, all I can say is that given the terrible pressures that the auto industry was under and that the middle class of this state and Ohio and Indiana and Illinois and Wisconsin and Missouri and other places in the Midwest were facing, I think it was the right decision to heed what President-elect Obama asked us to do.He sent a letter, an authorized letter, asking us to support that to save the auto industry. Yes, were there things in it that you and I would not have necessarily wanted? That's true. But when it came down to it, you were either for saving the auto industry or you were against it. I voted to save the auto industry. And I am very glad that I did. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, Don't, let me say this, Senator Sanders voted for that bill, we both supported it. And, I think it's fair to say we did because back then there was an outcry over the rising crime rate, and people from all communities were asking that action be taken.Now, my husband said at the NAACP last summer that it solved some problems, but it created other problems, and I agree. And, one of those problems was, unfortunately, a move to expand the reasons why people would be incarcerated, not just at the federal level which is what this bill about, but in states and localities as well. And, that's why the very first speech that I gave in this campaign was about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration because I believe absolutely that too many families were broken up, too many communities were adversely affected. So, we've got to do a bunch of things.On the criminal justice side, look, we've got to have better policing. That means body cameras, that means ending profiling, that means doing everything we can to make sure there's respect between the community and the police.And, when it comes to incarceration
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, Don, if I could, I think being a white person in the United States of America, I know that I have never had the experience that so many people, the people in this audience have had. And I think it's incumbent upon me and what I have been trying to talk about during this campaign is to urge white people to think about what it is like to have "the talk" with your kids, scared that your sons or daughters, even, could get in trouble for no good reason whatsoever like Sandra Bland and end up dead in a jail in Texas. [applause]And I have spent a lot of time with the mothers of African-American children who have lost them, Trayvon Martin's mother. And I've gotten to know them. I've listened to them. And it has been incredibly humbling because I can't pretend to have the experience that you have had and others have had. But I will do everything that I possibly can to not only do the best to understand and to empathize, but to tear down the barriers of systemic racism that are in the criminal justice system, in the employment system, in the education and health care system.That is what I will try to do to deal with what I know is the racism that still stalks our country. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, first of all I am looking at your daughter and I'm very grateful that she is laughing and she is on a road to recovery. But it never should have happened. You know, on average, 90 people a day are killed by gun violence in our country.I think we have to try everything that works to try to limit the numbers of people and the kinds of people who are given access to firearms. The Brady Bill, which has been in effect now for about 23 years, has kept more than two million purchases from going forward. So we do have to continue to try to work on that because not every killer will have the same profile.But the comprehensive background checks, closing the gun show loophole, closing the online loophole, closing what's called the Charleston loophole, where you get a gun at the end of three days, even if the background check is not completed which is what the killer in Charleston did. And then they found out later, he shouldn't have gotten the gun when he killed nine people at Mother Emmanuel Church.I also believe, so strongly Gene, that giving immunity to gunmakers and sellers was a terrible mistake. [applause]Because it removed any accountability from the makers and the sellers. And it also disrupted what was a very promising legal theory, to try to get makers to do more to make guns safer for example. To try to give sellers more accountability for selling guns when they shouldn't have. So that is an issue that Senator Sanders and I differ on, I voted against giving them immunity, but I think we should very seriously move to repeal that and go back to making sure gun makers and sellers are like any other business. They can be held accountable.And then I do think we have got to have a public
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, first, let me say I think I have the most comprehensive plan to combat climate change. It sets some very big goals, a half billion more solar panels deployed by the end of my first term, if I'm so fortunate to be president. And enough clean energy to power every home by the end of my second term.What I am looking at is how we make the transition from where we are today to where are today to where we must be. I worked with President Obama during the four years I was secretary of state to begin to put pressure on China and India and other countries to join with us to have a global agreement which we finally got in Paris.So I am committed to and focused on how we make that transition. I've already said we are taking away the subsidies for oil and gas, but it is important that people understand that a president can't go ordering folks around. Our system doesn't permit that. I am going to set the goals. I will push everybody as hard as I can to achieve those goals. We will make progress on clean renewable energy and create millions of jobs through that. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, I'll start by saying amen to that. [applause]We are here in Flint, I'm very grateful that my request that we hold this debate be held here so we can continue to shine a very bright spotlight on what has happened in this city.I agree, the Governor should resign, or be recalled [applause]  support the efforts of citizens attempting to achieve that. But, that is not enough. We have to focus on what must be done to help the people of Flint.I support a hundred percent the efforts by your senators and members of congress to get the money from the federal government in order to begin the work that must occur to fix the infrastructure. The state should also be sending money immediately to help this city. [applause and cheering]I know the state of Michigan has a rainy day fund for emergencies, what is more important than the health and wellbeing of the people, particularly children? It is raining lead in Flint, and the state is derelict in not coming forward with the money that is required. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, I'm running for president to do my very best to knock down every barrier that stands in the way of America realizing its potential and every American having a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. We have a lot of work to do. We have economic barriers. That's why I've laid out plans for more good jobs with rising incomes. We have barriers that stand in the way of quality health care. That's why I will build on the Affordable Care Act.We have barriers to education. That's why I want to start early and provide debt-free tuition, and deal with student debt so it is no longer the burden that weighs down so many young Americans. And I do want to take on the barriers of systemic racism. I may not have experienced them, but I see the results every single day.So I'm asking for your support in the primary here in Michigan on Tuesday. I'm asking for it, and I will do whatever I can as the Democratic nominee to run a campaign you'll be proud of.I don't intend to get into the gutter with whoever they nominate, but instead to lift our sights, to set big goals, to make it clear that America's best days can be and are ahead of us. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, I agree completely. I want to go further though. I want us to have an absolute commitment to getting rid of lead wherever it is because it's not only in water systems, it's also in soil, and it's in lead paint that is found mostly in older homes. That's why 500,000 children today have lead &mdash; lead in their bodies.So, I want to do exactly what you said. We will commit to a priority to change the water systems, and we will commit within five years to remove lead from everywhere.We were making progress on this in the 1990's. I worked with then Senator Obama to get more money, more support to do more to remove lead.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, I have been several times in your services and have joined in those prayers and have also been privileged to lead them in some settings. I pray very specifically for people whom I know by name. People who either have gone through or are experiencing difficult times, illness, divorce, death, disappointment, all of the life experiences that confront most of us.I pray for the will of God to be known that we can know it and to the best of our limited ability, try to follow it and fulfill it. I have said many times that, you know, I am a praying person, and if I haven't been during the time I was in the White House, I would have become one. Because it's very hard to imagine living under that kind of pressure without being able to fall back on prayer and on my faith.So I do pray for people in authority. I try to think about what they are going through, even when I disagree with them. Trying to find some common ground, some common understanding that perhaps can make me more empathetic. I don't always succeed. I will tell you that.So I pray on a pretty regular basis during the day, because I need that strength and I need that support. And especially when you are in the position that I'm in and that Senator Sanders is in, where you are asking people to vote for you, to give you the most important job, not only in our country, but I would argue in the world.I think humility is one of the most important attributes that you bring to both that seeking and then if you're fortunate enough, to that holding of office and that's what I will try to do. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, I support what President Obama is doing. He called for and got accountability from the officials at the EPA to make sure the state is doing its job. He expanded Medicaid for helping kids particularly to get the health care they need. He is also ordered that there be a Head Start program. I support that.When it comes to the water itself, we are supporting a program that Mayor Waver announced through Flint Waterworks to pay people in Flint, not outsiders, but people here to deliver the water while we are fixing the pipes. I would do even more of that. As president, what we were able to put together was a beginning. As president, I would concentrate resources on the city for economic development for more jobs as we fix the water and provide the health and education, interventions that children need.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, I think because throughout my public career I have been evening the odds for people in every way that I could. I started out with the Children's Defense Fund, I worked throughout my time as a young lawyer as a person, an activist. Certainly, in Arkansas, then in the White House, to try to fix problems wherever I saw them.And, this problem is one that is particularly outrageous and painful at the same time.So, when I heard about it I immediately sent people here to find out what was going on. It was almost unbelievable. We have this problem in other places, but we don't say that it was actually caused by decisions made by public officials in positions of authority, as this one was.Then, when I talked to the mayor I basically said, "What can I do to help?"Then, when I came here, and I met with some of the mothers, and met their children, and heard their stories &mdash; I'm just determined to do whatever I can. So, I have put together resources from the private and philanthropic communities to help provide a bridge because you've got to get the federal money, you've got to get the state money, but I'm going to do everything I can. And, I will be with Flint all the way through this crisis in whatever capacity I am.And, if I'm president, it will always be a priority for action from me. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, I think that the people here in the region, who knew about this and failed to follow what you just said, rightly, the law required, have been eliminated from the EPA.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, I think we are in vigorous agreement on this. I have said repeatedly no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail. And I have said that I would use the tools in the Dodd-Frank regulations, that if any bank posed a systemic risk to the economy, they would be broken up.Because we now have tools, laws that we didn't have before. And I am very happy we did. Because there does need to be accountability, including criminal accountability if it is called for.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, I was speaking about drug cartels and criminal activity that was very concerning to folks across the country. I think it was a poor choice of words, I never used it before, I haven't used it since, I would not use it again.Because my whole life, to go back to what I was saying to Mr. Mcgee, is, you know, really, ever since I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund, is to try to figure out ways to even the odds for people that are left out and left behind.And I know very well that we have too many kids in our country right now who are living in poverty, who are going to schools like the ones in Detroit that have mold and rodents in them. I saw that in South Carolina. It's unfortunately across America. So what we have got to do is provide more opportunities earlier in the lives of every child.That's why I believe in supporting families, early childhood education, universal pre-kindergarten, help kids be successful. And here is Flint, we've got to do more to mitigate against the effects of lead, because too many kids are having the experiences I've been told about, where they're falling back in school, where they are having headaches because of the lead exposure.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, if I &mdash; if I could [applause] to set the record straight, I voted against the only multinational trade agreement that came before me when I was in the Senate. It was called CAFTA. I came out against the TPP after it was finished. I thought it was reasonable to actually know what was in it before I opposed it. I oppose it. [applause]Now let me get back to what happened in January of 2009. The Bush administration negotiated the deal. Were there things in it that I didn't like? Would I have done it differently? Absolutely.But was the auto bailout money in it &mdash; the $350 billion that was needed to begin the restructuring of the auto industry? Yes, it was. So when I talk about Senator Sanders being a one-issue candidate, I mean very clearly &mdash; you have to make hard choices when you're in positions of responsibility. The two senators from Michigan stood on the floor and said, "we have to get this money released." I went with them, and I went with Barack Obama. You did not. If everybody had voted the way he did, I believe the auto industry would have collapsed, taking four million jobs with it. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, let me start by saying that the last time I checked as of last night, Donald Trump had received 3.6 million votes, which is a good number. And there is only one candidate in either party who has more votes than him and that's me. [applause]And, I am building a broad, diverse coalition across our country. I'm very excited by the support we're receiving. I have said, and I'll repeat here, I think that Donald Trump's bigotry, his bullying, his bluster, are not going to wear well on the American people. [applause]So, I will look forward to engaging him because, you know, I don't think we need to make America great again. America didn't stop being great, we have to make it whole again. We have to knock down the barriers, we have to end the divisiveness, we have to unify the country.And, if I'm fortunate enough to be the nominee that's exactly what I will do.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, once again, if we're going to argue about the '90s, let's try to get the facts straight. That bill had a lot of provisions that unfortunately were stripped out by George W. Bush, by Republican governors. And I disagreed with the way it was applied. And I have a very clear set of ideas about what should be done to try to provide more support, including trying to cut poverty in half in the next years.But if we are going to talk about the '90s, let's talk about 23 million new jobs, incomes went up for everybody. The median African- American income went up 33 percent at the end of the '90s and we lifted more people out of poverty than at any other time in recent history.So we were on the right path. More jobs, rising incomes.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, Senator Sanders voted for it as well. Are you going to ask him the same question?
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, that's going to be up to the legal system, Don. I mean, I can't standing here &mdash; I don't have all the facts, but people should be held accountable wherever that leads. If it leads to resignation, or recall if you're in political office.If it leads to civil penalties, if it leads to criminal responsibility. There has to be an absolute accountability, and I will support whatever the outcome of those investigations are.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, that &mdash; that is not &mdash; that is not what happened, and I think it's important for people to understand.Because of the proliferation of guns, because of the epidemic of gun violence in our country, there were a group of cities, states, and other concerned people who, in the late 90s and in the early 2000s, were working on legal theories that they thought would force gun makers to do more to make guns safer and force sellers to be much more responsible.The NRA saw this happening, and they said, "we've got to stop it. Last thing in the world we want is to have guns that you can only shoot with your fingerprint, or to have guns with such strong safety locks on them that they may not be sellable."So the NRA went to the Congress, and the head of the NRA has said this was the most important NRA legislation in more than 20 years
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, there's no doubt, we have an enormous backlog of infrastructure repairs. Here's what I'd do - the congress finally got around to pass the Highway Transportation Bill, which should never have been partisan - it turned into be one partisan argument. I want to go further.I want to put 250 billion dollars additional, on top of what Congress has done. That gets us to a half a billion. I want to start a National Infrastructure Bank. I want to capitalize it with 25 billion that I believe will leverage 10 times that, that's another 250 billion.So I'm trying to do this in a way that will gain support and be affordable but there's no doubt, we have to do more on our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports. And as we've talked in the beginning here, under our ground, our water systems, our sewer systems. We have pipelines that are leaking and that are dangerous. We have so much work to be done and if we can put millions of peoples to work, I think my plan is a very good way to begin doing that work and get people out there doing it.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Well, we've got to have a public discussion, because we have created a culture in which people grab for guns all the time.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~When I traveled around the world on you behalf as Secretary of State and went to 112 countries, one thing I saw everywhere was how European and Asian countries were supporting their companies back in their countries, to be able to make sales and contracts in a lot of the rest of the world. In fact, without the export-import bank, supporting businesses of all sizes &mdash; I believe more jobs would be lost here at home and more jobs literally would be exported. Instead of exporting products, we would be exporting jobs.I just believe that Senator Sanders took that lonely position because most of us who saw the results &mdash; I saw it as a senator from New York. Your Senators saw it here in Michigan. They can give you the names of 240 companies in Michigan that have been helped.There is a company in Levonia being helped, there are companies all over this state. I know, if we are going to compete and win in the global economy, we can't let every other country support their companies and we take a hands off approach. I will not agree with that.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~Yeah. Yeah. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~You know
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~You know what - I have told my friends at the top of both unions, we've got take a look at this because it is one of the most common criticisms. We need to eliminate the criticism.You know, teachers do so much good, they are often working under most difficult circumstances. So anything that could be changed, I want them to look at it. I will be a good partner to make sure that whatever I can do as president, I will do to support the teachers of our country.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~You know, I am proud to have been endorsed by the AFT and the NEA, and I've had very good relationship with both unions, with their leadership. And we've really candid conversations because we are going to have to take a look at &mdash; what do we need in the 21st century to really involve families, to help kids who have more problems than just academic problems?A lot of what has happened and honestly it really pains me, a lot of people have blaming and scape-goating teachers because they don't want to put the money into the schools system that deserve the support that comes from the government doing it's job.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~You know, I don't support it when any locality or any state is against it, number one. I don't support it when the release of methane or contamination of water is present. I don't support it &mdash; number three &mdash; unless we can require that anybody who fracks has to tell us exactly what chemicals they are using.So by the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place. And I think that's the best approach, because right now, there places where fracking is going on that are not sufficiently regulated.So first, we've got to regulate everything that is currently underway, and we have to have a system in place that prevents further fracking unless conditions like the ones that I just mentioned are met.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~You know, if we're going to argue about the 1990's instead of talking about the future, which I'd much prefer because I think every election is about the future, and you all deserve to know what we will do to help you have a brighter future &mdash; but, if we are going to talk about the 1990's I think it's only fair to say that at the end of the 1990's, after two terms of my husband's presidency, the unemployment rate in Michigan was 4.4 percent.There had been a net increase of 54,000 manufacturing jobs. There had been a net increase of 653,000 jobs overall.And, one of the ways jobs were brought to, and grown here in Michigan was through something called the Export-Import Bank which helped a lot of businesses, particularly small businesses, be able to export around the world.Senator Sanders opposes that. I think we're in a race for exports. I think China, Germany, everybody else supports their businesses. Here in Michigan there's been $11 billion dollars in recent years used to support exports, primarily from small businesses.I favor that, he's opposed it. I want to do everything I can for us to compete and win in the global economy
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Flint, Michigan~March 6, 2016~you talk about corporate greed?
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Absolutely. Of course.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~and saying, "please, do the right thing"
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~And when you want to, check it out. And if you think &mdash; if you think that we can simply go forward and pass something tomorrow without bringing people together, you are sorely mistaken.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Anderson, thank you very much. I think most Americans understand that our country today faces a series of unprecedented crises. The middle class of this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing. Millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, and yet almost all of the new income and wealth being created is going to the top one percent. As a result of this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, our campaign finance system is corrupt and is undermining American democracy. Millionaires and billionaires are pouring unbelievable sums of money into the political process in order to fund super PACs and to elect candidates who represent their interests, not the interests of working people. Today, the scientific community is virtually unanimous: climate change is real, it is caused by human activity, and we have a moral responsibility to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy and leave this planet a habitable planet for our children and our grandchildren. Today in America, we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth. African-American youth unemployment is 51 percent. Hispanic youth unemployment is 36 percent. It seems to me that instead of building more jails and providing more incarceration, maybe &mdash; just maybe &mdash; we should be putting money into education and jobs for our kids. [applause] What this campaign is about is whether we can mobilize our people to take back our government from a handful of billionaires and create the vibrant democracy we know we can and should have. Thank you. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~As a senator from a rural state, what I can tell Secretary Clinton, that all the shouting in the world is not going to do what I would hope all of us want, and that is keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have those guns and end this horrible violence that we are seeing. I believe that there is a consensus in this country. A consensus has said we need to strengthen and expand instant background checks, do away with this gun show loophole, that we have to address the issue of mental health, that we have to deal with the strawman purchasing issue, and that when we develop that consensus, we can finally, finally do something to address this issue.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~As someone who has taken on probably every special interest that there is in Washington, I would lump Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry at the top of my life of people who do not like me. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Black lives matter. [cheering]    And the reason &mdash; the reason those words matter is the African American community knows that on any given day some innocent person like Sandra Bland can get into a car, and then three days later she's going to end up dead in jail, or their kids  [applause]  are going to get shot. We need to combat institutional racism from top to bottom, and we need major, major reforms in a broken criminal justice system  [applause]  In which we have more people in jail than China. And, I intended to tackle that issue. To make sure that our people have education and jobs rather than jail cells. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Do I consider myself part of the casino capitalist process by which so few have so much and so many have so little by which Wall Street's greed and recklessness wrecked this economy? No, I don't. I believe in a society where all people do well. Not just a handful of billionaires. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Excuse me
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Governor
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~He did &mdash; he did break the law, and I think there should be a penalty to that. But I think what he did in educating us should be taken into consideration before he is (inaudible).
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I'll tell him. In my view, Secretary Clinton, you do not &mdash; Congress does not regulate Wall Street. Wall Street regulates Congress. [applause] And we have gotta break off these banks. Going to them
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I'm sorry?
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I didn't leave anybody at the altar. I voted against that piece of legislation because it had guest-worker provisions in it which the Southern Poverty Law Center talked about being semi-slavery. Guest workers are coming in, they're working under terrible conditions, but if they stand up for their rights, they're thrown out of the country. I was not the only progressive to vote against that legislation for that reason. Tom Harkin, a very good friend of Hillary Clinton's and mine, one of the leading labor advocates, also voted against that.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I don't believe that any  [crosstalk]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I don't think I am pandering. But you have not been in the United States Congress.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I have a lot of respect for president Obama. I have worked with him time and time again on many, many issues. But here's where I do disagree. I believe that the power of corporate America, the power of Wall Street, the power of the drug companies, the power of the corporate media is so great that the only way we really transform America and do the things that the middle class and working class desperately need is through a political revolution when millions of people begin to come together and stand up and say: Our government is going to work for all of us, not just a handful of billionaires. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I know that. But point being is that progressives did vote against that for that reason. My view right now &mdash; and always has been &mdash; is that when you have 11 million undocumented people in this country, we need comprehensive immigration reform, we need a path toward citizenship, we need to take people out of the shadows.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I suspect I would vote yes. [applause] And I would vote yes because I am seeing in this country too many lives being destroyed for non-violent offenses. We have a criminal justice system that lets CEOs on Wall Street walk away, and yet we are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana. I think we have to think through this war on drugs  [applause]  which has done an enormous amount of damage. We need to rethink our criminal justice system, we we've got a lot of work to do in that area.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I think &mdash; I think that there is profound frustration all over this country with establishment politics. I am the only candidate running for president who is not a billionaire, who has raised substantial sums of money, and I do not have a super PAC. [applause] I am not raising money from millionaires and billionaires, and in fact, tonight, in terms of what a political revolution is about, there are 4,000 house parties &mdash; 100,000 people in this country &mdash; watching this debate tonight who want real change in this country.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I think everybody is in agreement that we are a great entrepreneurial nation. We have got to encourage that. Of course, we have to support small and medium-sized businesses. But you can have all of the growth that you want and it doesn't mean anything if all of the new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. So what we need to do is support small and medium-sized businesses, the backbone of our economy, but we have to make sure that every family in this country gets a fair shake
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I think Snowden played a very important role in educating the American people to the degree in which our civil liberties and our constitutional rights are being undermined.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I think the governor gave a very good example about the weaknesses in that law and I think we have to take another look at it. But here is the point, Governor. We can raise our voices, but I come from a rural state, and the views on gun control in rural states are different than in urban states, whether we like it or not. Our job is to bring people together around strong, commonsense gun legislation. I think there is a vast majority in this country who want to do the right thing, and I intend to lead the country in bringing our people together.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I think the president is trying very hard to thread a tough needle here, and that is to support those people who are against Assad, against ISIS, without getting us on the ground there, and that's the direction I believe we should have (inaudible).
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I want to make
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I will, just a second.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~in order to make it possible for them to afford their education. And I want colleges to get their costs down. They are outrageously high in what they're charging.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~is kind of naive.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~It's exactly about rural.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~It was 99 to one and I was maybe the one. I don't know.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~largest banks in America &mdash; are much bigger than they were when we bailed them out for being too big to fail, we have got to break them up. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Let's begin, Anderson, by understanding that Bernie Sanders has a D-minus voting rating (ph) from the NRA. Let's also understand that back in 1988 when I first ran for the United States Congress, way back then, I told the gun owners of the state of Vermont and I told the people of the state of Vermont, a state which has virtually no gun control, that I supported a ban on assault weapons. And over the years, I have strongly avoided instant background checks, doing away with this terrible gun show loophole. And I think we've got to move aggressively at the federal level in dealing with the straw man purchasers. Also I believe, and I've fought for, to understand that there are thousands of people in this country today who are suicidal, who are homicidal, but can't get the healthcare that they need, the mental healthcare, because they don't have insurance or they're too poor. I believe that everybody in this country who has a mental crisis has got to get mental health counseling immediately.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Let me just respond to something the secretary said. First of all, she is talking about, as I understand it, a no-fly zone in Syria, which I think is a very dangerous situation. Could lead to real problems. Second of all, I heard the same evidence from President Bush and Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld about why we should overthrow Saddam Hussein and get involved in the &mdash; I would urge people to go to berniesanders.com, hear what I said in 2002. And I say, without any joy in my heart, that much of what I thought would happen about the destabilization, in fact, did happen. So I think
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Let me say this. [applause] Let me say &mdash; let me say something that may not be great politics. But I think the secretary is right, and that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Let us be clear that the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of Wall Street, where fraud is a business model, helped to destroy this economy and the lives of millions of people. [applause] Check the record. In the 1990s &mdash; and all due respect &mdash; in the 1990s, when I had the Republican leadership and Wall Street spending billions of dollars in lobbying, when the Clinton administration, when Alan Greenspan said, "what a great idea it would be to allow these huge banks to merge," Bernie Sanders fought them, and helped lead the opposition to deregulation. [applause] Today, it is my view that when you have the three
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~not just for billionaires.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Of course not. This was a large and complicated bill. There were provisions in it that I think made sense. For example, do I think that a gun shop in the state of Vermont that sells legally a gun to somebody, and that somebody goes out and does something crazy, that that gun shop owner should be held responsible? I don't. On the other hand, where you have manufacturers and where you have gun shops knowingly giving guns to criminals or aiding and abetting that, of course we should take action.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Pardon me?
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~The planet &mdash; the future of the planet is at stake.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~The Republican party, since I've been in the Senate, and since President Obama has been in office, has played a terrible, terrible role of being total obstructionists. Every effort that he has made, that some of us have made, they have said no, no, no. Now, in my view, the only way we can take on the right wing republicans who are, by the way, I hope will not continue to control the Senate and the House when one of us elected President  [applause]  But the only way we can get things done is by having millions of people coming together. If we want free tuition at public colleges and universities, millions of young people are going to have to demand it, and give the Republicans an offer they can't refuse. If we want to raise the minimum wage to $15 bucks an hour, workers are going to have to come together and look the Republicans in the eye, and say, "We know what's going on. You vote against us, you are out of your job." [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~The scientific community is telling us that if we do not address the global crisis of climate change, transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to sustainable energy, the planet that we're going to be leaving our kids and our grandchildren may well not be habitable. That is a major crisis.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~This is a great country, but we have many, many serious problems. We should not be the country that has the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country and more wealth and income inequality than any other country. We should not be the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all of our people as a right of citizenship and we should not be the only major country that does not provide medical and &mdash; and parental leave &mdash; family and parental leave to all of our families. Now, at the end of our day, here is the truth that very few candidates will say, is that nobody up here, certainly no Republican, can address the major crises facing our country unless millions of people begin to stand up to the billionaire class that has so much power over our economy and our political life. Jim Webb is right: Money is pouring in to this campaign through super PACs. We are doing it the old-fashioned way: 650,000 individual contributions. And if people want to help us out, BernieSanders.com. We are averaging $30 bucks apiece. We would appreciate your help. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, as somebody who has a D-minus voting record  [crosstalk]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, first of all, let's look at the facts. The facts that are very simple. Republicans win when there is a low voter turnout, and that is what happened last November. Sixty-three percent of the American people didn't vote, Anderson. Eighty percent of young people didn't vote. We are bringing out huge turnouts, and creating excitement all over this country. Democrats at the White House on down will win, when there is excitement and a large voter turnout, and that is what this campaign is doing.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, first of all, let's remember where we were when Bush left office. We were losing 800,000 jobs a month. And I know my Republican friends seem to have some amnesia on this issue, but the world's financial crisis was on &mdash; the world's financial markets system was on the verge of collapse. That's where we were. Are we better off today than we were then? Absolutely. But the truth is that for the 40 years, the great middle class of this country has been disappearing. And in my view what we need to do is create millions of jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure; raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour; pay equity for women workers; and our disastrous trade policies, which have cost us millions of jobs; and make every public college and university in this country tuition free. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, first of all, let me applaud my good friend Jim Webb for his service to this country in so many ways. [applause] Jim and I, under Jim's leadership, as he indicated, passed the most significant veterans education bill in recent history. We followed suit with a few years later passing, under my leadership, the most significant veterans' health care legislation in the modern history of this country. [applause] When I was a young man &mdash; I'm not a young man today. When I was a young man, I strongly opposed the war in Vietnam. Not the brave men like Jim who fought in that war, but the policy which got us involved in that war. That was my view then. [cheering and applause] I am not a pacifist, Anderson. I supported the war in Afghanistan. I supported President Clinton's effort to deal with ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. I support air strikes in Syria and what the president is trying to do. Yes, I happen to believe from the bottom of my heart that war should be the last resort that we have got to exercise diplomacy. But yes, I am prepared to take this country into war if that is necessary. [crosstalk]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, I remember that meeting very well. I remember it like it was yesterday. Hank Paulson, Bernanke came in, and they say, "guys, the economy is going to collapse because Wall Street is going under. It's gonna take the economy with them." And you know what I said to Hank Paulson? I said, "Hank, your guys &mdash; you come from Goldman Sachs. Your millionaire and billionaire friends caused this problem. How about your millionaire and billionaire friends paying for the bailout, not working families in this country?" So to answer your question, no, I would not have let the economy collapse. But it was wrong to ask the middle class to bail out Wall Street. And by the way, I want Wall Street now to help kids in this country go to college, public colleges and universities, free with a Wall Street speculation tax. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, I think he's already regretting what he did in Crimea and what he is doing in the Ukraine. I think he is really regretting the decline of his economy. And I think what he is trying to do now is save some face. But I think when Russians get killed in Syria and when he gets bogged down, I think the Russian people are going to give him a message that maybe they should come home, maybe they should start working with the United States to rectify the situation now.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, I think Mr. Putin is going to regret what he is doing. I think that when he gets into that
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, I was chairman for two years, and when I was chairman we did take action. What we did is pass a $15 billion dollar piece of legislation which brought in many, many new doctors, and nurses into the V.A. so that veterans in this country could get the health care when they needed it, and not be on long waiting lines. And, the other part of that legislation said that if a veteran is living more than 40 miles away from a V.A. facility, that veteran could get health care from the community health center, or the private sector. As a result of that legislation, we went further in than any time in recent history in improving health care for the men and women of this country who put their lives on the line to defend them.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, I will tell you this. I believe &mdash; and Pope Francis made this point. This is a moral issue. The scientists are telling us that we need to move extremely boldly. I am proud that, along with Senator Barbara Boxer, a few years ago, we introduced the first piece of climate change legislation which called for a tax on carbon. And let me also tell you that nothing is gonna happen unless we are prepared to deal with campaign finance reform, because the fossil fuel industry is funding the Republican Party, which denies the reality of climate change  [applause]  and certainly is not prepared to go forward aggressively. This is a moral issue. We have got to be extremely aggressive in working with China, India, Russia.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, I would shut down &mdash; make &mdash; I'd shut down what exists right now is that virtually every telephone call in this country ends up in a file at the NSA. That is unacceptable to me. But it's not just government surveillance. I think the government is involved in our e-mails; is involved in our websites. Corporate America is doing it as well. If we are a free country, we have the right to be free. Yes, we have to defend ourselves against terrorism, but there are ways to do that without impinging on our constitutional rights and our privacy rights. O'MALLEY (?): Anderson, the NSA
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, let's understand that when we talk about Syria, you're talking about a quagmire in a quagmire. You're talking about groups of people trying to overthrow Assad, other groups of people fighting ISIS. You're talking about people who are fighting ISIS using their guns to overthrow Assad, and vice versa. I'm the former chairman of the Senate Veterans Committee, and in that capacity I learned a very powerful lesson about the cost of war, and I will do everything that I can to make sure that the United States does not get involved in another quagmire like we did in Iraq, the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country. We should be putting together a coalition of Arab countries who should be leading the effort. We should be supportive, but I do not support American ground troops in Syria.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, let me tell you, Donald Trump and his billionaire friends under my policies are going to pay a hell of a lot more in taxes today &mdash; taxes in the future than they're paying today. [applause] But in terms of education, this is what I think. This is the year 2015. A college degree today, Dana, is the equivalent of what a high school degree was 50 years ago. And what we said 50 years ago and a hundred years ago is that every kid in this country should be able to get a high school education regardless of the income of their family. I think we have to say that is true for everybody going to college. I think we don't need a complicated system, which the secretary is talking about, the income goes down, the income goes down, if you're poor you have to work, and so forth and so on. I pay for my program, by the way, through a tax on Wall Street speculation, which will not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, it will substantially lower interest rates on college debt, a major crisis in this country. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, obviously, I voted, when President Clinton said, "let's stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo," I voted for that. I voted to make sure that Osama bin Laden was held accountable in Afghanistan. When our country is threatened, or when our allies are threatened, I believe that we need coalitions to come together to address the major crises of this country. I do not support the United States getting involved in unilateral action. ( UNKNOWN ): You're at work with our allies. [crosstalk]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, that's not true. [laughter]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, we're gonna win because first, we're gonna explain what democratic socialism is. And what democratic socialism is about is saying that it is immoral and wrong that the top one-tenth of 1 percent in this country own almost 90 percent &mdash; almost &mdash; own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. That it is wrong, today, in a rigged economy, that 57 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent. That when you look around the world, you see every other major country providing health care to all people as a right, except the United States. You see every other major country saying to moms that, when you have a baby, we're not gonna separate you from your newborn baby, because we are going to have &mdash; we are gonna have medical and family paid leave, like every other country on Earth. Those are some of the principles that I believe in, and I think we should look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway, and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~What I mean is that we need to have one of the larger voter turnouts in the world, not one of the lowest. We need to raise public consciousness. We need the American people to know what's going on in Washington in a way that today they do not know. [applause] And when people come together in a way that does not exist now and are prepared to take on the big money interest, then we could bring the kind of change we need.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~When the Republicans &mdash; when the Republicans in the Congress and some Democrats were talking about cutting Social Security and benefits for disabled veterans, for the so-called chained CPI, I founded a caucus called the Defending Social Security Caucus. My view is that when you have millions of seniors in this country trying to get by &mdash; and I don't know how they do on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year &mdash; you don't cut Social Security, you expand it. And the way you expand it is by lifting the cap on taxable incomes so that you do away with the absurdity of a millionaire paying the same amount into the system as somebody making $118,000. You do that, Social Security is solvent until 2061 and you can expand benefits. [crosstalk]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Yeah, Dana, here's the point: Every other major country on Earth, every one, including some small countries, say that when a mother has a baby, she should stay home with that baby. We are the only major country. That is an international embarrassment that we do not provide family &mdash; paid family and medical leave. [applause] Second of all, the secretary is right. Republicans tell us we can't do anything except give tax breaks to billionaires and cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. That's not what the American people want.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~You know? The middle class &mdash; Anderson, and let me say something about the media, as well. I go around the country, talk to a whole lot of people. Middle class in this country is collapsing. We have 27 million people living in poverty. We have massive wealth and income inequality. Our trade policies have cost us millions of decent jobs. The American people want to know whether we're going to have a democracy or an oligarchy as a result of Citizens Union. Enough of the e-mails. Let's talk about the real issues facing America. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~8 million kids. So I have a long history of getting things done, rooted in the same values
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~And I do think that the bilateral agreement that President Obama made with the Chinese was significant. Now, it needs to go further, and there will be an international meeting at the end of this year, and we must get verifiable commitments to fight climate change from every country gathered there.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~And I think we have an opportunity here &mdash; and I know that inside the administration this is being hotly debated &mdash; to get that leverage to try to get the Russians to have to deal with everybody in the region and begin to move toward a political, diplomatic solution in Syria.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~and would give regulators the authority to go after the big banks.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~But I'll be there. I'll answer their questions. But tonight, I want to talk not about my e-mails, but about what the American people want from the next president of the United States. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~But I'm telling you &mdash; I will say it tonight. If only you look at the big banks, you may be missing the forest for the trees. [crosstalk]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~But let &mdash; I'll get to that. But I think it's important, since I understand Senator Webb's very strong feelings about this, to explain where we were then and to point out that I think President Obama made the right decision at the time. And the Libyan people had a free election the first time since 1951. And you know what, they voted for moderates, they voted with the hope of democracy. Because of the Arab Spring, because of a lot of other things, there was turmoil to be followed. But unless you believe the United States should not send diplomats to any place that is dangerous, which I do not, then when we send them forth, there is always the potential for danger and risk.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~But, yes, I would like students to work 10 hours a week
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Demonize hard-working immigrants who have insulted them. You know, I came to Las Vegas in, I think, May. Early may. Met with a group of DREAMers, I wish everybody in America could meet with this young people, to hear their stories, to know their incredible talent, their determination, and that's why I would go further
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~good start, and I think that we have to implement it. We have to prevent the Republicans from ripping it apart. We have to save the Consumer Financial Protection board, which is finally beginning to act to protect consumers. [applause] We have work to do. You've got no argument from me. But I know, if we don't come in with a very tough and comprehensive approach, like the plan I'm recommending, we're gonna be behind instead of ahead
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~He broke the laws of the United States. He could have been a whistleblower. He could have gotten all of the protections of being a whistleblower. He could have raised all the issues that he has raised. And I think there would have been a positive response to that.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~How are we going to get health care for everybody  [crosstalk]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I'm a progressive. But I'm a progressive who likes to get things done. And I know  [applause]  how to find common ground, and I know how to stand my ground, and I have proved that in every position that I've had, even dealing with Republicans who never had a good word to say about me, honestly. But we found ways to work together on everything from
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I'm running because I have a lifetime of experience in getting results and fighting for people, fighting for kids, for women, for families, fighting to even the odds. And I know what it takes to get things done. I know how to find common ground and I know how to stand my ground. And I think we're going to need both of those in Washington to get anything that we're talking about up here accomplished. So I'm very happy that I have both the commitment of a lifetime and the experience of a lifetime to bring together to offer the American people.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I've always had.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I &mdash; I think it has to be continued threat from the spread of nuclear weapons, nuclear material that can fall into the wrong hands. I know the terrorists are constantly seeking it, and that's why we have to stay vigilant, but also united around the world to prevent that.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I want to enhance the benefits for the poorest recipients of Social Security. We have a lot of women on Social Security, particularly widowed and single women who didn't make a lot of money during their careers, and they are impoverished, and they need more help from the Social Security system. And I will focus &mdash; I will focus on helping those people who need it the most. And of course I'm going to defend Social Security. I'm going to look for ways to try to make sure it's solvent into the future. And we also need to talk about health care at some time, because we agree on the goals, we just disagree on the means.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I want to follow up because I think underneath Juan Carlos' important questions, there is such a difference between everything you're hearing here on this stage, and what we hear from the Republicans. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~If their states agree, then we want more states to do the same thing.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~if you don't have schools that are able to meet the needs of the people, or good housing, there's a long list  [applause]  We need a new New Deal for communities of color
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Mm-hmm.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~My plan would support any state that takes that position, and would work with those states and encourage more states to do the same thing.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~my principles and the results that I get.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~No, I don't. I think that it was necessary to make sure that we were able after 9/11 to put in place the security that we needed. And it is true that it did require that there be a process. What happened, however, is that the Bush administration began to chip away at that process. And I began to speak out about their use of warrantless surveillance and the other behavior that they engaged in. We always have to keep the balance of civil liberties, privacy and security. It's not easy in a democracy, but we have to keep it in mind.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~No, not at all. I think that we have to look at the fact that we lose 90 people a day from gun violence. This has gone on too long and it's time the entire country stood up against the NRA. The majority of our country  [applause]   supports background checks, and even the majority of gun owners do. Senator Sanders did vote five times against the Brady bill. Since it was passed, more than 2 million prohibited purchases have been prevented. He also did vote, as he said, for this immunity provision. I voted against it. I was in the Senate at the same time. It wasn't that complicated to me. It was pretty straightforward to me that he was going to give immunity to the only industry in America. Everybody else has to be accountable, but not the gun manufacturers. And we need to stand up and say: Enough of that. We're not going to let it continue. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~no, that's not what
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~No.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~No. I think that we have the opportunity through the states that are pursuing recreational marijuana to find out a lot more than we know today. I do support the use of medical marijuana, and I think even there we need to do a lot more research so that we know exactly how we're going to help people for whom medical marijuana provides relief. So, I think we're just at the beginning, but I agree completely with the idea that we have got to stop imprisoning people who use marijuana. Therefore, we need more states, cities, and the federal government to begin to address this so that we don't have this terrible result that Senator Sanders was talking about where we have a huge population in our prisons for nonviolent, low-level offenses that are primarily due to marijuana.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~No. I think that, like most people that I know, I have a range of views, but they are rooted in my values and my experience. And I don't take a back seat to anyone when it comes to progressive experience and progressive commitment. You know, when I left law school, my first job was with the Children's Defense Fund, and for all the years since, I have been focused on how we're going to un-stack the deck, and how we're gonna make it possible for more people to have the experience I had. You know, to be able to come from a grandfather who was a factory worker, a father who was a small business person, and now asking the people of America to elect me president.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~not taking a back seat to anybody on my values
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~of the world. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~on what the next crisis could be.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~really hard to do if you don't have early childhood education
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~reforming foster care and adoption to the Children's Health Insurance Program, which insures
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~So
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~So I'm with both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley in putting a lot of attention onto the banks. And the plan that I have put forward would actually empower regulators to break up big banks if we thought they posed a risk. But I want to make sure we're going to cover everybody, not what caused the problem last time, but what could cause it next time. [crosstalk]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~than even the executive orders that President Obama has signed when I'm president. (CROSS TALK)
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Thank you very much, Anderson. And thanks to all the viewers who tuned in tonight. I think what you did see is that, in this debate, we tried to deal with some of the very tough issues facing our country. That's in stark contrast to the Republicans who are currently running for president. What you have to ask yourself is: Who amongst us has the vision for actually making the changes that are going to improve the lives of the American people? Who has the tenacity and the ability and the proven track record of getting that done? Now, I revere my late mother, and she gave me a lot of good advice. But one of the best pieces of advice she gave me was, you know, the issue is not whether or not you get knocked down. It's whether you get back up. America's been knocked down. That Great Recession, 9 million people lost their jobs, 5 million lost their homes, $13 trillion in wealth disappeared. And although we've made progress, we're standing but not running the way America needs to. My mission as president will be to raise incomes for hard-working middle-class families and to make sure that we get back to the basic bargain I was raised with: If you work hard and you do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead. Please join me in this campaign. Please come and make it clear that America's best days are still ahead. Thank you very much. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Thank you, Bernie. Thank you. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Thank you. Me, too. Me, too.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~that &mdash; I think Dodd-Frank was a very
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, actually, I have been very consistent. Over the course of my entire life, I have always fought for the same values and principles, but, like most human beings &mdash; including those of us who run for office &mdash; I do absorb new information. I do look at what's happening in the world. You know, take the trade deal. I did say, when I was secretary of state, three years ago, that I hoped it would be the gold standard. It was just finally negotiated last week, and in looking at it, it didn't meet my standards. My standards for more new, good jobs for Americans, for raising wages for Americans. And I want to make sure that I can look into the eyes of any middle-class American and say, "this will help raise your wages." And I concluded I could not.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, but all &mdash; well, on a state level, a state as big as many countries in the world. And it has not had the ill effects that the Republicans are always saying it will have. And I think this is &mdash; this is typical Republican scare tactics. We can design a system and pay for it that does not put the burden on small businesses. I remember as a young mother, you know, having a baby wake up who was sick and I'm supposed to be in court, because I was practicing law. I know what it's like. And I think we need to recognize the incredible challenges that so many parents face, particularly working moms. I see my good friend, Senator Gillibrand, in the front row. She's been a champion of this. We need to get a consensus through this campaign, which is why I'm talking about it everywhere I go, and we need to join the rest of the advanced world in having it.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, first of all, I
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, first of all, I want to make sure every child gets health care. That's why I helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program, and I want to support states that are expanding health care and including undocumented children and others. I want to open up the opportunity for immigrants to be able to buy in to the exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. I think to go beyond that, as I understand what Governor O'Malley has recommended, so that they would get the same subsidies. I think that is &mdash; it raises so many issues. It would be very difficult to administer, it needs to be part of a comprehensive immigration reform, when we finally do get to it.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, first of all, we got a lot of business done with the Russians when Medvedev was the president, and not Putin. We got a nuclear arms deal, we got the Iranian sanctions, we got an ability to bring important material and equipment to our soldiers in Afghanistan. There's no doubt that when Putin came back in and said he was going to be President, that did change the relationship. We have to stand up to his bullying, and specifically in Syria, it is important &mdash; and I applaud the administration because they are engaged in talks right now with the Russians to make it clear that they've got to be part of the solution to try to end that bloody conflict. And, to &mdash; provide safe zones so that people are not going to have to be flooding out of Syria at the rate they are. And, I think it's important too that the United States make it very clear to Putin that it's not acceptable for him to be in Syria creating more chaos, bombing people on behalf of Assad, and we can't do that if we don't take more of a leadership position, which is what I'm advocating.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, I'm surprised she says that, because California has had a paid leave program for a number of years. And it's
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, I've taken responsibility for it. I did say it was a mistake. What I did was allowed by the State Department, but it wasn't the best choice. And I have been as transparent as I know to be, turning over 55,000 pages of my e-mails, asking that they be made public. And you're right. I am going to be testifying. I've been asking to testify for some time and to do it in public, which was not originally agreed to. But let's just take a minute here and point out that this committee is basically an arm of the Republican National Committee. [applause] It is a partisan vehicle, as admitted by the House Republican majority leader, Mr. McCarthy, to drive down my poll numbers. Big surprise. And that's what they have attempted to do. I am still standing. I am happy to be part of this debate. [applause] And I intend to keep talking about the issues that matter to the American people. You know, I believe strongly that we need to be talking about what people talk to me about, like how are we going to make college affordable? How are we going to pay down student debt?
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, I am in the middle, here, and  [laughter] Lots of things coming from all directions.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, I can't think of anything more of an outsider than electing the first woman president, but I'm not just running because I would be the first woman president. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, I fully support Social Security. And the most important fight we're going to have is defending it against continuing Republican efforts to privatize it.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, I never said it wasn't legitimate. I said that I have answered all the questions and I will certainly be doing so again before this committee. But I think it would be really unfair not to look at the entire picture. This committee has spent $4.5 million of taxpayer money, and they said that they were trying to figure out what we could do better to protect our diplomats so that something like Benghazi wouldn't happen again. There were already seven committee reports about what to do. So I think it's pretty clear what their obvious goal is.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, I recall very well being on a debate stage, I think, about 25 times with then Senator Obama, debating this very issue. After the election, he asked me to become Secretary of State. He valued my judgment, and I spent a lot of time with him  [applause]  in the Situation Room, going over some very difficult issues. You know, I &mdash; I agree completely. We don't want American troops on the ground in Syria. I never said that. What I said was we had to put together a coalition &mdash; in fact, something that I worked on before I left the State Department &mdash; to do, and yes, that it should include Arabs, people in the region. Because what I worry about is what will happen with ISIS gaining more territory, having more reach, and, frankly, posing a threat to our friends and neighbors in the region and far beyond. So I think while you're talking about the tough decision that President Obama had to make about Osama bin Laden, where I was one of his few advisers, or putting together that coalition to impose sanctions on Iran &mdash; I think I have a lot of evidence  [crosstalk]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, I think that's pretty obvious. I think being the first woman president would be quite a change from the presidents we've had up until this point, including President Obama.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, I think that President Obama has been a great moral leader on these issues, and has laid out an agenda that has been obstructed by the Republicans at every turn, so  [applause]  So, what we need to be doing is not only reforming criminal justice &mdash; I have talked about that at some length, including things like body cameras, but we also need to be following the recommendations of the commissioner that President Obama empanelled on policing. There is an agenda there that we need to be following up on. Similarly, we need to tackle mass incarceration, and this may be the only bi-partisan issue in the congress this year. We actually have people on both sides of the aisle who have reached the same conclusion, that we can not keep imprisoning more people than anybody else in the world. But, I believe that the debate, and the discussion has to go further, Anderson, because we've got to do more about the lives of these children. That's why I started off by saying we need to be committed to making it possible for every child to live up to his or her god given potential. That is
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, I would not ask anyone to vote for me based on my last name. I would ask them to listen to what I'm proposing, look at what I've accomplished in the Senate, as secretary of of state, and then draw your own conclusion. I certainly am not campaigning to become president because my last name is Clinton. I'm campaigning because I think I have the right combination of what the country needs, at this point, and I think I can take the fight to the Republicans, because we cannot afford a Republican to succeed Barack Obama as president of the United States.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, in addition to the NRA, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the Iranians. [laughter]Probably the Republicans. [laughter and applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, let's remember what was going on. We had a murderous dictator, Gadhafi, who had American blood on his hands, as I'm sure you remember, threatening to massacre large numbers of the Libyan people. We had our closest allies in Europe burning up the phone lines begging us to help them try to prevent what they saw as a mass genocide, in their words. And we had the Arabs standing by our side saying, "We want you to help us deal with Gadhafi." Our response, which I think was smart power at its best, is that the United States will not lead this. We will provide essential, unique capabilities that we have, but the Europeans and the Arabs had to be first over the line. We did not put one single American soldier on the ground in Libya. And I'll say this for the Libyan people
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, let me address college affordability, because I have a plan that I think will really zero in on what the problems are. First, all the 40 million Americans who currently have student debt will be able to refinance their debt to a low interest rate. That will save thousands of dollars for people who are now struggling under this cumbersome, burdensome college debt. As a young student in Nevada said to me, the hardest thing about going to college should not be paying for it. So then we have to make it more affordable. How do we make it more affordable? My plan would enable anyone to go to a public college or university tuition free. You would not have to borrow money for tuition. But I do believe &mdash; and maybe it's because I worked when I went through college; I worked when I went through law school &mdash; I think it's important for everybody to have some part of getting this accomplished. That's why I call it a compact.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, let me just follow-up on that, Anderson, because when I think about capitalism, I think about all the small businesses that were started because we have the opportunity and the freedom in our country for people to do that and to make a good living for themselves and their families. And I don't think we should confuse what we have to do every so often in America, which is save capitalism from itself. And I think what Senator Sanders is saying certainly makes sense in the terms of the inequality that we have. But we are not Denmark. I love Denmark. We are the United States of America. And it's our job to rein in the excesses of capitalism so that it doesn't run amok and doesn't cause the kind of inequities we're seeing in our economic system. But we would be making a grave mistake to turn our backs on what built the greatest middle class in the history
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, look, you know, when people say that &mdash; it's always the Republicans or their sympathizers who say, "You can't have paid leave, you can't provide health care." They don't mind having big government to interfere with a woman's right to choose and to try to take down Planned Parenthood. They're fine with big government when it comes to that. I'm sick of it. [applause] You know, we can do these things. [applause] We should not be paralyzed &mdash; we should not be paralyzed by the Republicans and their constant refrain, "big government this, big government that," that except for what they want to impose on the American people. I know we can afford it, because we're going to make the wealthy pay for it. That is the way to get it done.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, my plan is more comprehensive. And frankly, it's tougher because of course we have to deal with the problem that the banks are still too big to fail. We can never let the American taxpayer and middle class families ever have to bail out the kind of speculative behavior that we saw. But we also have to worry about some of the other players &mdash; AIG, a big insurance company; Lehman Brothers, an investment bank. There's this whole area called "shadow banking." That's where the experts tell me the next potential problem could come from.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, nobody does. Nobody does, Senator Sanders.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, thank you, and thanks to everyone for hosting this first of the Democratic debates. I'm Hillary Clinton. I have been proud and privileged to serve as first lady, as a senator from New York, and as secretary of state. I'm the granddaughter of a factory worker and the grandmother of a wonderful one-year-old child. And every day, I think about what we need to do to make sure that opportunity is available not just for her, but for all of our children. I have spent a very long time &mdash; my entire adult life &mdash; looking for ways to even the odds to help people have a chance to get ahead, and, in particular, to find the ways for each child to live up to his or her God-given potential. I've traveled across our country over the last months listening and learning, and I've put forward specific plans about how we're going to create more good-paying jobs: by investing in infrastructure and clean energy, by making it possible once again to invest in science and research, and taking the opportunity posed by climate change to grow our economy. At the center of my campaign is how we're going to raise wages. Yes, of course, raise the minimum wage, but we have to do so much more, including finding ways so that companies share profits with the workers who helped to make them. And then we have to figure out how we're going to make the tax system a fairer one. Right now, the wealthy pay too little and the middle class pays too much. So I have specific recommendations about how we're going to close those loopholes, make it clear that the wealthy will have to pay their fair share, and have a series of tax cuts for middle-class families. And I want to do more to help us balance family and work. I believe in equal pay for equal work for women, but I also believe it's about time we had paid family leave for American families and join the rest of the world. [applause] During the course of the evening tonight, I'll have a chance to lay out all of my plans and the work that I've done behind them. But for me, this is about bringing our country together again. And I will do everything I can to heal the divides &mdash; the divides economically, because there's too much inequality; the racial divides; the continuing discrimination against the LGBT community &mdash; so that we work together and, yes, finally, fathers will be able to say to their daughters, you, too, can grow up to be president. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, thank you. (LAUGHTER)
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, that &mdash; that's exactly what I've been doing. When we met in Copenhagen in 2009 and, literally, President Obama and I were hunting for the Chinese, going throughout this huge convention center, because we knew we had to get them to agree to something. Because there will be no effective efforts against climate change unless China and India join with the rest of the world. They told us they'd left for the airport; we found out they were having a secret meeting. We marched up, we broke in, we said, "We've been looking all over for you. Let's sit down and talk about what we need to do." And we did come up with the first international agreement that China has signed. Thanks to President Obama's leadership, it's now gone much further.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, there's a lot that I would like to do to build on the successes of President Obama, but also, as I'm laying out, to go beyond. And that's in my economic plans, how I would deal with the prescription drug companies, how I would deal with college, how I would deal with a full range of issues that I've been talking about throughout this campaign to go further.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, you know, both Bill and I have been very blessed. Neither of us came from wealthy families and we've worked really hard our entire lives. And I want to make sure every single person in this country has the same opportunities that he and I have had, to make the most of their God-given potential and to have the chances that they should have in America for a good education, good job training, and then good jobs. I have a five point economic plan, because this inequality challenge we face, we have faced it at other points. It's absolutely right. It hasn't been this bad since the 1920s. But if you look at the Republicans versus the Democrats when it comes to economic policy, there is no comparison. The economy does better when you have a Democrat in the White House and that's why we need to have a Democrat in the White House in January 2017.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, you know, everybody on this stage has changed a position or two. We've been around a cumulative quite some period of time. [laughter] You know, we know that if you are learning, you're gonna change your position. I never took a position on Keystone until I took a position on Keystone. But I have been on the forefront of dealing with climate change, starting in 2009, when President Obama and I crashed (ph) a meeting with the Chinese and got them to sign up to the first international agreement to combat climate change that they'd ever joined. So I'm
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Yeah. You know, I &mdash; I respect the passion an intensity. I represented Wall Street, as a senator from New York, and I went to Wall Street in December of 2007 &mdash; before the big crash that we had &mdash; and I basically said, "cut it out! Quit foreclosing on homes! Quit engaging in these kinds of speculative behaviors." I took on the Bush administration for the same thing. So I have thought deeply and long about what we're gonna do to do exactly what I think both the senator and the governor want, which is to rein in and stop this risk. And my plan would have the potential of actually sending the executives to jail. Nobody went to jail after $100 billion in fines were paid  [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~You know, I have to say, I was very pleased when Governor O'Malley endorsed me for president in 2008, and I enjoyed his strong support in that campaign. And I consider him, obviously, a friend. Let me say &mdash; because there's a lot of loose talk going on here &mdash; we are already flying in Syria just as we are flying in Iraq. The president has made a very tough decision. What I believe and why I have advocated that the no-fly zone &mdash; which of course would be in a coalition &mdash; be put on the table is because I'm trying to figure out what leverage we have to get Russia to the table. You know, diplomacy is not about getting to the perfect solution. It's about how you balance the risks.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~You know, it does take me a little longer. That's all I can say.
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~All right. Well, I'm trying to set a mark here so maybe we can get into a little more later on. This hasn't been equal time. But if you want to look at what has happened, if we look at the facts in terms of how we're going to deal with this, since that crash, in the last 10 years, the amount of the world's capital economy that Wall Street manages has gone from 44 percent to 55 percent. That means the Wall Street money managers are not risking themselves as the same way the American people are when they're going to get their compensation. They're managing money from all over the world. We have to take that into consideration when we're looking at ways to regulate it.
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~And I put the African American soldier on the Mall. I made that recommendation and fought for it. So, if you want someone who is &mdash; can stand up in front of you right now and say I have done the hard job, I have taken the risks, I am your person.
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~And I would say this. I've been waiting for 10 minutes. I will say this.
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Anderson, can I come into this discussion at some point?
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Anderson, I need to jump in (inaudible).
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Bernie, say my name so I can get into this.
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Can I  [crosstalk]
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Everybody makes their decisions when the time there is conscription. And as long as they go through the legal process that our country requires, I respect that. And it would be for the voters to decide whether Senator Sanders or anyone else should be president. I will say this, coming from the position that I've come from, from a military family, with my brother a marine, my son was a marine in Iraq, I served as a marine, spending five years in the Pentagon, I am comfortable that I am the most qualified person standing up here today to be your commander-in-chief.
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Giving a pathway to citizenship to those people who had come here, and put down their roots, and met as a series of standards
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I'd have to say the enemy soldier that threw the grenade that wounded me, but he's not around right now to talk to.
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I &mdash; well, I &mdash; I would leave his ultimate judgment to the legal system. Here's what I do believe. We have a serious problem in terms of the collection of personal information in this country. And one of the things that I did during the FISA bill in 2007, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, was introduce with Russ Feingold two amendments basically saying, "We understand the realities of how you have to collect this broad information in the Internet age, but after a certain period of time, you need to destroy the personal information that you have if people have not been brought &mdash; if criminal justice proceedings have not been brought against them." We've got a vast data bank of information that is ripe for people with bad intentions to be able to use. And they need to be destroyed.
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I believe that the signal that we sent to the region when the Iran nuclear deal was concluded was that we are accepting Iran's greater position on this very important balance of power, among our greatest ally Israel, and the Sunnis represented by the Saudi regime, and Iran. It was a position of weakness and I think it encouraged the acts that we've seen in the past several weeks.
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I got a great deal of admiration and affection for Senator Sanders, but I &mdash; Bernie, I don't think the revolution's going to come. And I don't think the Congress is going to pay for a lot of this stuff. And if there would be a major difference between my administration and the Obama administration, it would be in the use of executive authority. I came up as a committee counsel in the Congress, used to put dozens of bills through the House floor every year as a committee counsel on the Veterans Committee. I have a very strong feeling about how our federal system works and how we need to lead and energize the congressional process instead of allowing these divisions to continue to paralyze what we're doing. So I would lead &mdash; working with both parties in the Congress and working through them in the traditional way that our Constitution sets (ph).
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I hope I can get that kind of time here. As a President of the United States, every life in this country matters. At the same time, I believe I can say to you, I have had a long history of working with the situation of African Americans. We're talking about criminal justice reform, I risked my political life raising the issue of criminal justice reform when I ran for the Senate in Virginia in 2006. I had democratic party political consultants telling me I was committing political suicide. We led that issue in the congress. We started a national debate on it. And it wasn't until then that the Republican Party started joining in. I also represented a so-called war criminal, an African American Marine who was wounded &mdash; who was convicted of murder in Vietnam, for six years. He took his life three years into this. I cleared his name after &mdash; after three years.
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I will &mdash; well, you've let a lot of people go over their time. I would say this
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I wouldn't have a problem with that. Let me start by saying my wife is an immigrant. She was a refugee, her family escaped from Vietnam on a boat-- her entire extended family, after the communists took over, when hundreds of thousands of people were out there and thousands of them were dying. Went to two refugee camps, she never spoke English in her home, and she ended, as I said, graduating from Cornell Law School. That's not only American dream, that's a value that we have with a good immigration system in place. No country has &mdash; is a country without defining its borders. We need to resolve this issue. I actually introduced an amendment in the 2007 immigration bill
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~It's just &mdash; it's gone back and forth over there.
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Look, let's start &mdash; I've been trying to get in this conversation for about 10 minutes &mdash; let's start with why Russia is in Syria right now. There are three strategic failings that have allowed this to occur. The first was the invasion of Iraq, which destabilized ethnic elements in Iraq and empowered Iran. The second was the Arab Spring, which created huge vacuums in Libya and in Syria that allowed terrorist movements to move in there. And the third was the recent deal allowing Iran to move forward and eventually acquire a nuclear weapon, which sent bad signals, bad body language into the region about whether we are acquiescing in Iran becoming a stronger piece of the formula in that part of the world. Now, I say this as someone who spent five years in the Pentagon and who opposed the war in Iraq, whose son fought in Iraq, I've fought in Vietnam. But if you want a place where we need to be in terms of our national strategy, a focus, the greatest strategic threat that we have right now is resolving our relationship with China. And we need to do this because of their aggression in the region. We need to do it because of the way they treat their own people.
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Look, there are two fundamental issues that are involved in this discussion. We need to pay respect to both of them. The first is the issue of who should be kept from having guns and using firearms. And we have done not a good job on that. A lot of them are criminals. And a lot of the people are getting killed are members of gangs inside our urban areas. And a lot of them are mentally incapacitated. And the shooting in Virginia Tech in '07, this individual had received medical care for mental illness from three different professionals who were not allowed to share the information. So we do need background checks. We need to keep the people who should not have guns away from them. But we have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family from violence.
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~lost (ph) &mdash; I introduced that in 2007 &mdash; We need a comprehensive reform, and we need to be able to define our borders.
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~May I? People are going back and forth here for 10 minutes here. There are people at high levels in this government who have bodyguards 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The average American does not have that, and deserves the right to be able to protect their family.
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~No, actually I believe that I am where the Democratic Party traditionally has been. The Democratic Party, and the reason I've decided to run as a Democrat, has been the party that gives people who otherwise have no voice in the corridors of power a voice. And that is not determined by race. And as a clarification, I have always supported affirmative action for African Americans. That's the way the program was originally designed because of their unique history in this country, with slavery and the Jim Crow laws that followed. What I have discussed a number of times is the idea that when we create diversity programs that include everyone, quote, "of color," other than whites, struggling whites like the families in the Appalachian mountains, we're not being true to the Democratic Party principle of elevating the level of consciousness among our people about the hardships that a lot of people who happen to be have &mdash; by culture, by the way.
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~OK. Thank you. [laughter]
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Our greatest long-term strategic challenge is our relation with China. Our greatest day-to-day threat is cyber warfare against this country. Our greatest military-operational threat is resolving the situations in the Middle East.
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Thank you. [crosstalk]
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Thank you. I've been standing over here for about ten minutes, trying.
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, it's been a pleasure to be with you tonight. You've heard a lot of promises up here; you've heard a lot of rhetoric. They all seem to happen during campaigns, and then once the election's over, people start from scratch again and try to get things done. One of the things I can promise you, if you look at my record, in and out of government, is that I've always been willing to take on a complicated, something unpopular issues, and work them through, the complex issues, and work them through in order to have the solution. We did it with criminal justice reform. We've had a lot of discussion here about criminal justice reform. We did it in other ways. We need a national political strategy for our economy, for our social policy, for social justice, and, by the way, for how you run and manage the most complex bureaucracy in the world, which is the federal government. I know how to lead. I did it in Vietnam, I did it in the Pentagon, I did it in the Senate, and if you will help me overcome this cavalcade of &mdash; of financial irregularities and money that is poisoning our political process, I am ready to do that for you in the White House.
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Thank you. You know, people are disgusted with the way that money has corrupted our political process, intimidating incumbents and empowering Wall Street every day, the turnstile government that we see, and also the power of the financial sector in both parties. They're looking for a leader who understands how the system works, who has not been coopted by it, and also has a proven record of accomplishing different things. I have a record of working across the political aisle. I've also spent more than half of my professional life away from politics in the independent world of being an author, a journalist, and a sole proprietor. In government service, I've fought and bled for our country in Vietnam as a Marine. I spent years as Assistant Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Navy &mdash; in the Reagan administration. In the senate, I spoke about economic fairness and social justice from day one. I also wrote and passed the best piece of veterans education legislation in history, the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill. I brought criminal justice reform out of the political shadows and into the national discussion. I led what later became called the Strategic Pivot to Asia two years before President Obama was elected. I know where my loyalties are. My mother grew up in the poverty of east Arkansas chopping cotton, picking strawberries. Three of her seven siblings died in childhood. My wife, Hong, came to this country as a refugee from war torn Vietnam &mdash; learned English, a language that was not spoken at home, and earned her way into Cornell Law School. I have five daughters. Amy works with disabled veterans, Sarah is an emergency room nurse, Julia is a massage therapist, Emily and Georgia are still in school. My son Jim fought as an infantry Marine on the bloody streets of Ramadi. You may be sure that in a Webb administration, the highest priority will be the working people who every day go out and make this country stronger at home, and who give us the right reputation and security overseas under a common sense foreign policy. [cheering and applause]
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~There is a reality that I think we all need to recognize with respect to the power of the financial sector. And let me just go back a minute and say that on this TARP program, I introduced a piece of legislation calling for a windfall profits tax on the executives of any of these companies that got more than $5 billion, that it was time for them, once they got their compensation and their bonus, to split the rest of the money they made with the nurses and the truck drivers and the soldiers who bailed them out. With respect to the financial sector, I mean, I know that my time has run out but in speaking of changing positions and the position on how this debate has occurred is kind of frustrating because unless somebody mentions my name I can't get into the discussion.
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~This is not about Benghazi per se. To me it is the inevitability of something like Benghazi occurring in the way that we intervened in Libya. We had no treaties at risk. We had no Americans at risk. There was no threat of attack or imminent attack. There is plenty of time for a president to come to the Congress and request authority to use military force in that situation. I called for it on the Senate floor again and again. I called for it in Senate hearings. It is not a wise thing to do. And if people think it was a wise thing to do, try to get to the Tripoli airport today. You can't do it.
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~to the unelected, authoritarian government of China: You do not own the South China Sea. You do not have the right to conduct cyber warfare against tens of millions of American citizens. And in a Webb administration, we will do something about that.
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, the &mdash; the question really is how are we going to solve energy problems here and in the global environment if you really want to address climate change? And when I was in the Senate, I was an all-of-the-above energy voter. We introduced legislation to bring in alternate energy as well as nuclear power. I'm a strong proponent of nuclear power. It is safe, it is clean. And really, we are not going to solve climate change simply with the laws here. We've done a good job in this country since 1970. If you look at China and India, they're the greatest polluters in the world. Fifteen out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world are in one of those two countries. We need to solve this in a global way. It's a global problem and I have been very strong on &mdash; on doing that. The &mdash; the agreements &mdash; the so-called agreements that we have had with China are illusory in terms of the immediate requirements of the &mdash; of the Chinese government itself. So let's solve this problem in an international way, and then we really will have a &mdash; a way to address climate change.
Jim Webb~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~You got the lucky [inaudible].
Lincoln Chafee~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Absolutely. We have to repair American credibility after we told the world that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which he didn't. So there's an issue of American credibility out there. So any time someone is running to be our leader, and a world leader, which the American president is, credibility is an issue out there with the world. And we have repair work to be done. I think we need someone that has the best in ethical standards as our next president. That's how I feel.
Lincoln Chafee~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~And it all started with the Iraq invasion.
Lincoln Chafee~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~And then we can help the middle class and hard-earning Americans &mdash; hard-working Americans.
Lincoln Chafee~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Anderson, you're looking at a block of granite when it comes to the issues. Whether it's  [crosstalk]
Lincoln Chafee~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~But let me just say
Lincoln Chafee~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Certainly, ending the wars. We've got to stop these wars. You have to have a new dynamic, a new paradigm. We just spent a half-billion dollars arming and training soldiers, the rebel soldiers in Syria. They quickly join the other side. We bombed the  [crosstalk]
Lincoln Chafee~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Did you hear what I said? On the issues. I have not changed on the issues. I was a liberal Republican, then I was an independent, and now I'm a proud Democrat. But I have not changed on the issues. And I open my record to scrutiny. Whether it's on the environment, a woman's right to choose, gay marriage, fiscal responsibility, aversion to foreign entanglements, using the tools of government to help the less fortunate. Time and time again, I have never changed. You're looking at a block of granite when it comes to the issues. So I have not changed.
Lincoln Chafee~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I'd just arrived at the Senate. I think we'd get some takeovers, and that was one. It was my very first vote, and it was 92-5. It was the
Lincoln Chafee~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I'd like to finish my question &mdash; my answer. And also we just bombed a hospital. We've had drone strikes that hit civilian weddings. So I would change how we &mdash; our approach to the Middle East. We need a new paradigm in the Middle East.
Lincoln Chafee~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I guess the coal lobby. I've worked hard for climate change and I want to work with the coal lobby. But in my time in the Senate, tried to bring them to the table so that we could address carbon dioxide. I'm proud to be at odds with the coal lobby.
Lincoln Chafee~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I think you're being a little rough. I'd just arrived at the United States Senate. I'd been mayor of my city. My dad had died. I'd been appointed by the governor. It was the first vote and it was 90-5, because it was a conference report. But let me just say about income inequality. We've had a lot of talk over the last few minutes, hours, or tens of minutes, but no one is saying how we're going to fix it. And it all started with the Bush tax cuts that favored the wealthy. So let's go back to the tax code. And 0.6 percent of Americans are at the top echelon, over 464,000, 0.6 Americans. That's less than 1 percent. But they generate 30 percent of the revenue. And they're doing fine.
Lincoln Chafee~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~It's certainly the chaos in the Middle East. There's no doubt about it.
Lincoln Chafee~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~No, I would bring him home. The courts have ruled that what he did &mdash; what he did was say the American  [crosstalk]
Lincoln Chafee~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~No, no. As long as you're getting a warrant, I believe that under the Fourth Amendment, you should be able to do surveillance, but you need a warrant. That's what the Fourth Amendment says. And in the Patriot Act, section 215 started to get broadened too far. So I would be in favor of addressing and reforming section 215 of the Patriot Act.
Lincoln Chafee~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~No, that was another 99 to one vote for the Patriot Act, and it was seen as at the time modernizing our ability to do what we've always done to tap phones which always required a warrant. And I voted for that.
Lincoln Chafee~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~OK. I just have to answer one thing that Senator Webb said about the Iran deal, because I'm a strong proponent of what President Obama &mdash; and he said that because of that the Iran deal that enabled Russia to come in. No, that's not true, Senator Webb. I respect your foreign policy chops. But Russia is aligned with Iran and with Assad and the Alawite Shias in Syria. So that Iran deal did not allow Russia to come in.
Lincoln Chafee~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~So there's still a lot more money to be had from this top echelon. I'm saying let's have another tier and put that back into the tax bracket. And that will generate $42 billion.
Lincoln Chafee~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Thank you, Anderson. Thank you, CNN, and thank you Facebook for organizing this debate. Not only will Americans be electing a new president next year, we also will be electing a world leader. Voters should assess the candidate's experience, character and vision for the future as they make this important decision. I'm the only one running for president that has been a mayor, a United States senator, and a governor. As mayor, I brought labor peace to my city and kept taxes down. I was reelected three times. As a senator, I earned a reputation for courageous votes against the Bush-Cheney tax cuts the favored the wealthy, against the tragedy of the Iraq war, for environmental stewardship, for protection of our civil liberties. I served on the Foreign Relations Committee and I chaired the Middle East Subcommittee for four years. As governor, I came in at the depths of the recession and we turned my state around. Rhode Island had the biggest drop of the unemployment rate over my four budgets of all but one state. It happens to be Nevada, where we're having this debate. I'm very proud that over my almost 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals. I've always been honest. I have the courage to take the long-term view, and I've shown good judgment. I have high ethical standards. As we look to the future, I want to address the income inequality, close the gap between the haves and the have-nots. I want to address climate change, a real threat to our planet. And I believe in prosperity through peace. I want to end these wars. I look forward to the discussion ahead. Thank you [applause]
Lincoln Chafee~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Thank you, Anderson. Thank you, CNN. And thank you, Facebook, for sponsoring this debate. America has many challenges confronting us &mdash; ending the perpetual wars, addressing climate change, addressing income inequality, funding education, funding infrastructure, funding healthcare, helping black Americans, helping Native Americans. We have many challenges. Who is best able to confront these challenges? I've served in government at many levels. I know what it's like to solve problems at the local level because I did it as mayor. I know how to get legislation passed through Congress because I did it as a senator. I know how to turn around a state because I did as governor of Rhode Island. But what I'm most proud of is that in 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals. I have high ethical standards. And what I'm most proud of is my judgment, particularly in the Iraq war vote. There was a lot of pressure &mdash; political pressure, public pressure. But I did my homework and I did not believe that the evidence was there that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. And we live now with the consequences. So that kind of judgment is what we want in a president going forward. And I'm running for president to end the wars. I want to be the peacemaker. I am a proven peacemaker. Please go to Chafee 2016 to learn more about me. Thank you. [applause]
Lincoln Chafee~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~the American government was acting illegally. That's what the federal courts have said; what Snowden did showed that the American government was acting illegally for the Fourth Amendment. So I would bring him home.
Lincoln Chafee~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~The Glass-Steagall was my very first vote, I'd just arrived, my dad had died in office, I was appointed to the office, it was my very first vote.
Lincoln Chafee~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~The party left me. There's no doubt about that. There was no room for a liberal moderate Republican in that party. I even had a primary for my reelection in 2006. I won it. But the money poured in to defeat me in Rhode Island as a Republican. That's what we were up against.
Lincoln Chafee~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, we just heard Senator Sanders say that it's the worst decision in American history. That's very significant, the worst decision in American history, I just heard from Senator Sanders. So, as we look ahead, if you're going to make those poor judgment calls, a critical time in our history, we just finished with the Vietnam era, getting back into another quagmire &mdash; if you're looking ahead, and you're looking at someone who made that poor decision in 2002 to go into Iraq when there was no real evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq &mdash; I know because I did my homework, and, so, that's an indication of how someone will perform in the future. And that's what's important. [applause]
Lincoln Chafee~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Yes, I have a good record of voting for gun commonsense safety legislation, but the reality is, despite these tragedies that happen time and time again, when legislators step up to pass commonsense gun safety legislation, the gun lobby moves in and tells the people they're coming to take away your guns. And, they're successful at it, in Colorado and others states, the legislators that vote for commonsense gun safety measures then get defeated. I even saw in Rhode Island. So, I would bring the gun lobby in and say we've got to change this. Where can we find common ground? Wayne Lapierre from the NRA, whoever it is, the leaders. Come one, we've go to change this. We're not coming to take away your guns, we believe in the Second Amendment, but let's find common ground here.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~And a lot of the xenophobes, the immigrant haters like some that we've heard like, Donald Trump, that carnival barker in the Republican party  (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~And I have an F from the NRA, Senator.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~And Juan Carlos &mdash; Juan Carlos
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~And we did it by leading with principle, not by pandering to the NRA and backing down to the NRA.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~And, Anderson, I also had to overcome a lot of opposition in the leadership of my own party to get this done. Look, it's fine to talk about all of these things &mdash; and I'm glad we're talking about these things &mdash; but I've actually done them. We passed comprehensive gun safety legislation, not by looking at the pollings or looking at what the polls said. We actually did it. And, Anderson, here tonight in our audience are two people that make this issue very, very real. Sandy and Lonnie Phillips are here from Colorado. And their daughter, Jessie, was one of those who lost their lives in that awful mass shooting in Aurora. Now, to try to transform their grief, they went to court, where sometimes progress does happen when you file in court, but in this case, you want to talk about a &mdash; a rigged game, Senator? The game was rigged. A man had sold 4,000 rounds of military ammunition to this &mdash; this person that killed their daughter, riddled her body with five bullets, and he didn't even ask where it was going. And not only did their case get thrown out of court, they were slapped with $200,000 in court fees because of the way that the NRA gets its way in our Congress and we take a backseat. It's time to stand up and pass comprehensive gun safety legislation as a nation. [applause]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Anderson, I actually have talked about a revolution. What we need is a green energy revolution. We need to move America to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050 and create 5 million jobs along the way.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Anderson, I think there's lessons to be learned from Benghazi. And those lessons are that we need to do a much better job as a nation of having human intelligence on the ground so that we know who the emerging next generation leaders are that are coming up to replace a dictator when his time on this planet ends. And I believe that's what Chris Stevens was trying to do. But he did not have the tools. We have failed as a country to invest in the human intelligence that would allow us to make not only better decisions in Libya, but better decisions in Syria today. And it's a huge national security failing.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Anderson, I think we are learning  [crosstalk]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Anderson, in our state, we actually expanded family leave. And I have to agree with Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders. Look, the genius of our nation is that we find ways in every generation to include more of our people more fully in the economic life of our country, and we need to do that for our families, and especially so that women aren't penalized in having to drop out of the workforce. My wife, Katie, is here with our four kids. And, man, that was a juggle when we had little kids and &mdash; and keeping jobs and moving forwards. We would be a stronger nation economically if we had paid family leave.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Anderson, look, this is &mdash; the big banks &mdash; I mean, once we repealed Glass-Steagall back in the late 1999s (ph), the big banks, the six of them, went from controlling, what, the equivalent of 15 percent of our GDP to now 65 percent of our GDP. And &mdash; (inaudible) right before this debate, Secretary Clinton's campaign put out a lot of reversals on positions on Keystone and many other things. But one of them that we still have a great difference on, Madam Secretary, is that you are not for Glass-Steagall. You are not for putting a firewall between this speculative, risky shadow banking behavior. I am, and the people of our country need a president who's on their side, willing to protect the Main Street economy from recklessness on Wall Street. We have to fulfill
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Anderson, no president &mdash; no commander in chief &mdash; should take the military option off the table, even if most of us would agree that it should be the last option. What disturbed people so much about &mdash; and I would agree with Senator Sanders on this &mdash; leading us into Iraq under false pretenses and telling us, as a people, that there were weapons of mass destruction there was &mdash; was one of the worst blunders in modern American history. But the reason why people remain angry about it is because people feel like a lot of our legislators got railroaded in a war fever and by polls. And I remember being at a dinner shortly before that invasion. People were talking at &mdash; and saying, "it'll take us just a couple years to rebuild democracy," and I thought, "has this world gone mad?" Whenever we go &mdash; and contrary to John Quincy Adams' advice &mdash; "searching the world for monsters to destroy," and when we use political might to take a &mdash; at the expense of democratic principle, we hurt ourselves, and we hurt our [inaudible].
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Anderson, Snowden put a lot of Americans' lives at risk. Snowden broke the law. Whistleblowers do not run to Russia and try to get protection from Putin. If he really believes that, he should be back here.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Anderson, thank you. I am very, very grateful to have been able to be on this stage with this distinguished group of candidates tonight. And what you heard tonight, Anderson, was a very, very &mdash; and all of you watching at home &mdash; was a very, very different debate than from the sort of debate you heard from the two presidential Republican debates. [applause] On this stage &mdash; on this stage, you didn't hear anyone denigrate women, you didn't hear anyone make racist comments about new American immigrants, you didn't hear anyone speak ill of another American because of their religious belief. What you heard instead on this stage tonight was an honest search for the answers that will move our country forward, to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050, to take the actions that we have always taken as Americans so that we can actually attack injustice in our country, employ more of our people, rebuild our cities and towns, educate our children at higher and better levels, and include more of our people in the economic, social, and political life of our country. I truly believe that we are standing on the threshold of a new era of American progress. Unless you've become discouraged about our gridlock in Congress, talk to our young people under 30, because you'll never find among them people that want to bash immigrants or people that want to deny rights to gay couples. [applause] That tells me we are moving to a more connected, generous, and compassionate place, and we need to speak to the goodness within our country. [applause]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Anderson, the point that the Black Lives Matter movement is making is a very, very legitimate and serious point, and that is that as a nation we have undervalued the lives of black lives, people of color. When I ran for Mayor of Baltimore &mdash; and we we burying over 350 young men ever single year, mostly young, and poor, and black, and I said to our legislature, at the time when I appeared in front of them as a mayor, that if we were burying white, young, poor men in these number we would be marching in the streets and there would be a different reaction. Black lives matter, and we have a lot of work to do to reform our criminal justice system, and to address race relations in our country. [applause]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Anderson, we actually did this in my state of Maryland. We passed  [applause]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Anderson, when the NRA wrote to everyone in our state &mdash; when the NRA wrote to members in our state and told people with hunting traditions lies about what our comprehensive gun safety legislation is, I wrote right back to them and laid out what it actually did. And that's why, not only did we pass it, but the NRA didn't
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Because we built a public consensus
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~but will become American citizens
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~dare to petition a referendum
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Have you ever been to the Eastern Shore? Have you ever been to Western Maryland? We were able to pass this and still respect the hunting traditions of people who live in our rural areas.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Here. Here. (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I believe that now that we're finally having debates, Anderson, that we don't have to be defined by the email scandal, and how long &mdash; what the FBI's asking about. Instead, we can talk about affordable college, making college debt free, and all the issues. Which is why &mdash; and I see the chair of the DNC here, look how glad we are actually to be talking about the issues that matter the most to people around the kitchen table. We need to get wages to go up, college more affordable
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I believe that nuclear Iran remains the biggest threat, along with the threat of ISIL; climate change, of course, makes cascading threats even more (inaudible).
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I believe that, as president, I would not be so quick to pull for a military tool. I believe that a no-fly zone in Syria, at this time, actually, Secretary, would be a mistake. You have to enforce no-fly zones, and I believe, especially with the Russian air force in the air, it could lead to an escalation because of an accident that we would deeply regret. I support President Obama. I think we have to play a long game, and I think, ultimately &mdash; you want to talk about blunders? I think Assad's invasion of Syria will be seen as a blunder.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~I would follow through on the promise that the American people thought we made as Democratic Party, to protect the Main Street economy from recklessness on Wall Street. I would push to separate out these too-big-to-jail, too-big-to-fail banks, and put in place Glass-Steagall, a modern Glass-Steagall that creates a firewall so that this wreckage of our economy can never happen again.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~immigration reform. It'll make wages go up in America $250 for every year
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Juan Carlos, I think what you've heard up here is some of the old thinking on immigration reform, and that's why it's gridlocked. We need to understand that our country is stronger in every generation by the arrival of new American immigrants. That is why I have put out a policy for comprehensive immigration reform, that is why I would go further than President Obama has on DACA, and DAPA. I mean, we are a nation of immigrants, we are made stronger by immigrants. Do you think for a second that simply because somebody's standing in a broken que on naturalization they're not going to go to the hospital, and that care isn't going to fall on to our insurance rates? I am for a generous, compassionate America that says we're all in this together. We need comprehensive
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Juan Carlos? [applause]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~My name is Martin O'Malley, former Mayor of Baltimore, former governor of Maryland, a life long democrat, and most importantly, a husband, and a father. My wife Katie and I have four great kids, Grace, and Tara, and William and Jack. And, like you, there is nothing we wouldn't do to give them healthier and better lives. There are some things that I have learned to do better in life than others. And, after 15 years of executive experience, I have learned how to be an effective leader. Whether it was raising the minimum wage, making our public schools the best in America, passing marriage equality, the DREAM Act, and comprehensive gun safety legislation, I have learned how to get things done because I am very clear about my principals. Thanks to President Obama, our country has come a long way since the Wall Street crash of 2008. Our country's doing better, we are creating jobs again. But we elected a president, not a magician, and there is urgent work that needs to be done right now. For there is a &mdash; deep injustice, an economic injustice that threatens to tear our country apart, and it will not solve itself. Injustice does not solve itself. What I'm talking about is this, our middle class is shrinking. Our poor families are becoming poorer, and 70 percent of us are earning the same, or less than we were 12 years ago. We need new leadership, and we need action. The sort of action that will actually make wages go up again for all American families. Our economy isn't money, it's people. It's all of our people, and so we must invest in our country, and the potential of our kids to make college a debt free option for all of our families, instead of settling our kids with a lifetime of crushing debt. And, we must square our shoulders to the great challenge of climate change and make this threat our opportunity. The future is what we make of it. We are all in this together. And, the question in this election is whether you and I still have the ability to give our kids a better future. I believe we do, that is why I am running for president, and I need your help. Thank you. [applause]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~our promise.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Senator &mdash; Senator, excuse me. [crosstalk]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Senator, it is not about rural &mdash; Senator, it was not about rural and urban.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Thank you.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~The National Rifle Association. [applause]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Tried to mischaracterize it as free tuition for illegal immigrants. But, we took our case to the people when it was petitioned to referendum, and we won with 58 percent of the vote. The more our children learn, the more they will earn, and that's true of children who have yet to be naturalized
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~We can do it.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~we need to make American 100 percent clean electric by 2050.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~We passed a state version of the DREAM Act  (CHEERING)
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, actually, you know, we had this conversation. And I will share with you that I've traveled all around the country, Anderson, and there's two phrases I keep hearing again and again and again. And they're the phrases "new leadership" and "getting things done." We cannot be this dissatisfied with our gridlocked national politics and an economy where 70 percent of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago, and think that a resort to old names is going to move us forward. I respect what Secretary Clinton and her husband have done for our country. But our country needs new leadership to move forward.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, I think the key word in your followup there was the word "settle." That's true. It was settled. Arrests peaked in 2003, Anderson, but they declined every year after that as we restored peace in our poorer neighborhoods so that people could actually walk and not have to worry about their kids or their loved ones of being victims of violent crime. Look, none of this is easy. None of us has all the answers. But together as a city, we saved a lot of lives. It was about leadership. It was about principle. And it was about bringing people together.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, let's talk about this a little bit. One of the things that was not reported during that heartbreaking night of unrest in Baltimore was that arrests had actually fallen to a 38-year low in the year prior to the Freddie Gray's tragic death. Anderson, when I ran for mayor of Baltimore back in 1999, it was not because our city was doing well. It was because we allowed ourselves to become the most violent, addicted, and abandoned city in America. And I ran and promised people that together we could turn that around. And we put our city on a path to reduce violent crime, or part one (ph) crime by more than any other major city in America over the next 10 years. I did not make our city immune to setbacks. But I attended a lot of funerals, including one for a family of seven who were firebombed in their sleep for picking up the phone in a poor African-American neighborhood and calling the police because of drug dealers on their corner. We've saved over a thousand lives in Baltimore in the last 15 years of people working together. And the vast majority of them were young and poor and black. It wasn't easy on any day. But we saved lives and we gave our city a better future, improving police and community relations every single day that I was in office.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Well, maybe that's a healthy thing. [laughter]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Yeah. Anna, I have put forward a plan &mdash; and I'm the only candidate, I believe, in either party to do this &mdash; to move America forward to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050. We did not land a man on the moon with an all-of-the-above strategy. It was an intentional engineering challenge, and we solved it as a nation. And our nation must solve this one. So I put forward the plan that would extend the investor tax credits for solar and for wind. If you go across Iowa, you see that 30 percent of their energy now comes from wind. We're here in Las Vegas, one of the most sustainable cities in America, doing important things in terms of green building, architecture and design. We can get there as a nation, but it's going to require presidential leadership. And as president, I intend to sign as my very first order in office the &mdash; an order that moves us as a nation and dedicates our resources to solving this problem and moving us to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Yes, actually, I believe what she said was that there's a lot of policies that have led to this unrest. But, Anderson, when I ran for mayor of Baltimore in 1999
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~October 13, 2015~Yes. Anderson, I want to associate myself with many of the items that the senator from Vermont mentioned, and I actually did them in our state. We raised the minimum wage, passed the living wage, invested more in infrastructure, went four years in a row without a penny's increase in college tuition. But there's another piece that Senator Sanders left out tonight, but he's been excellent about underscoring that. And that is that we need to separate the casino, speculative, mega-bank gambling that we have to insure with our money, from the commercial banking &mdash; namely, reinstating Glass-Steagall. Secretary Clinton mentioned my support eight years ago. And Secretary, I was proud to support you eight years ago, but something happened in between, and that is, Anderson, a Wall Street crash that wiped out millions of jobs and millions of savings for families. And we are still just as vulnerable Paul Volcker says today. We need to reinstate Glass-Steagall and that's a huge difference on this stage among us as candidates.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Absolutely.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~All right.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~All right. Let's keep going. OK.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~And I also voted and helped lead the effort against the war in Iraq, which will go down in history as one of the worst foreign blunders -- foreign policy blunders in the history of our country.I voted against the first Gulf War, which set the stage, I believe, for the second Iraq war. And what I believe right now, and I believe this is terribly important, is the United States of America cannot succeed, or be thought of as the policeman of the world, that when there's an international crisis all over the world, in France and in the U.K. Or -- hey, just call up the American military and the American taxpayers, they're going to send the troops.And if they have to be in the Middle East for 20 or 30 years no problem.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~And I understand in many universities a heck of a lot of vice presidents who earn a big salary. But, bottom line is this is the year 2015. If we are going to be competitive in the global economy we need the best educated workforce.It is insane to my mind, hundreds of thousands of young people today, bright qualified people, cannot go to college because they cannot afford -- their families cannot afford to send them. Millions coming out of school as you indicated, deeply in debt. What do we do?My proposal is to put a speculation tax on wall street, raise very substantial sums of money, not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, but also substantially lower interest rates on student debt. You have families out there paying 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent on student debt; refinance their homes at 3 percent.What sense is that? So I think we need radical changes in the funding of higher education. We should look at college today the way high school was looked at 60 years ago. All young people who have the ability should be able to get a college education. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~And universities.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~But I want to talk -- I want to talk about something else, because Secretary Clinton I think made some interesting and good points. What you have now is a very dangerous moment in American history.The secretary is right: Our people are fearful. They are anxious on a number of levels. They are anxious about international terrorism and the possibility of another attack on America. We all understand that.But you know what else they're anxious about? They're anxious about the fact that they are working incredibly long hours, they're worried about their kids, and they're seeing all the new income and wealth -- virtually all of it -- going to the top 1 percent. And they're looking around them, and they're looking at Washington, and they're saying the rich are getting much richer, I'm getting poorer, what are you going to do about it? What are you going to do for my kids?And somebody like a Trump comes along and says, &quot;I know the answers. The answer is that all of the Mexicans, they're criminals and rapists, we've got to hate the Mexicans. Those are your enemies. We hate all the Muslims, because all of the Muslims are terrorists. We've got to hate the Muslims.&quot; Meanwhile, the rich get richer.So what I say to those people who go to Donald Trump's rallies, understand: He thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea. He thinks low wages are a good idea.I believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this country, not allow them to divide us by race or where we come from. Let's create an America that works for all of us, not the handful on top. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~But Secretary Clinton is wrong.As you know, because I know you know a lot about health care. You know that the United States per capita pays far and away more than other country. And it is unfair simply to say how much more the program will cost without making sure that people know that, we are doing away with cost of private insurance and that the middle class will be paying substantially less for health care on the single payer than on the Secretary's Clinton proposal.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~But they will not be paying, Martha, any private insurance. So it's unfair to say in total
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~But what
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~But what my parents did accomplish is they were able to send both of their sons to college. We were the first in the family. So I know something about economic anxiety and living in a family does not have sufficient income.And that is why I am pledged, if elected president of the United States, to bring about a political revolution where millions of people begin to stand up and finally say enough is enough, this great country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires. Thank you very much. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Can I just say this
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Could I just say -- just say this
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~David
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~David, let me give you a little bit of background here.The DNC has hired vendors. On two occasions, there were breeches in information two months ago. Our staff found information on our computers from the Clinton campaign. And when our staffers said, &quot;whoa, what's going here?&quot; They went to the DNC quietly.They went to the vendor and said, &quot;hey, something is wrong,&quot; and that was quietly dealt with. None of that information was looked at. Our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing.A few days ago a similar incident happened. There was a breach because the DNC vendor screwed up, information came to our campaign. In this case, our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked at that information. As soon as we learned that they looked at that information - we fired that person. We are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved.Thirdly, what I have a really problem, and as you mentioned - this is a problem, I recognize it as a problem. But what the DNC did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign. That is an egregious act. I'm glad that late last night, that was resolved.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~David, thank you.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Every (inaudible) Democrat and senator in support of this proposal introduced by your good friend and my good friend, Kirsten Gillibrand, Rosa DeLauro, that is the legislation out there that will finally provide family and medical leave.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Excuse me. May I have a chance to respond to this issue?
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~First of all, let's have some rules here, commentators.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~First of all, we recognize that we have a rigged economy, as you've indicated. Middle class in this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing; are we better off today than we were when Bush left office? Absolutely. But as you've indicated for millions of American workers, people in New Hampshire -- all over America, they're working longer hours for lower wages deeply worried about their kids. So what do we do?First statement is, we tell the billionaire class, &quot;they cannot have it all.&quot; For a start, they're going to start to pay their fair share of taxes. Second of all what we do, is you raise the minimum wage to living wage, 15 bucks an hour over the next several years. Next thing we do, pay equity for women workers. Women should not be making 79 cents on the dollar compared to that.Next thing that we do, real unemployment -- official unemployment, 5 percent, real employment 10 percent, youth unemployment, off the charts. We rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our roads our bridges, our rail systems, we create 13 million jobs with a trillion-dollar investment.Furthermore, in a competitive global economy, it is imperative that we have the best educated workforce in the world. That is why I'm going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation to make certain that public colleges and universities in America are tuition free.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Fourthly, I work -- look forward to working with Secretary Clinton for an investigation, an independent investigation, about all of the breaches that have occurred from day one in this campaign, because I am not convinced that information from our campaign may not have ended up in her campaign. Don't know that.But we need an independent investigation, and I hope Secretary Clinton will agree with me for the need of that.Last point. When we saw the breach two months, we didn't go running to the media and make a big deal about it. And it bothers me very much that, rather than working on this issue to resolve it, it has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign later.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Given the fact that she's a lot smarter than me, yes, she would. [laughter]And let me, by the way, take this moment to congratulate Hillary Clinton, who I thought not only did an outstanding job as our first lady, but redefined what that role could be.So, I thank you very much for that. [laughter]My wife, Jane, has been -- way back when before I knew her, a foster parent. Many, many kids came into her home and received the kind of love that they desperately needed. And she turned around many lives.She is the best parent and grandmother that I know. She has devoted her life, when I was mayor of the city of Burlington, actually when I first met her, we started a youth office, which started a after-school programs for kids, started a child care center, started a youth newspaper. We got the kids involved in a whole lot of issues.She led that effort. So I think, at a time when so many of our kids are desperately looking for constructive activity, where too many of our kids are hanging around on street corners, potentially getting into trouble, I think we need a forceful advocate for the children, for teenagers, for the little children, to deal with the dysfunctional child care system, and I think my wife would do a great job in helping me accomplish those goals.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Good evening.I am running for president of the United States because it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. I'm running for president because our economy is rigged because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent. I'm running for president because I'm going to create an economy that works for working families not just billionaires.I'm running for president because we have a campaign finance system which is corrupt, where billionaires are spending hundreds of millionaires of dollars to buy candidates who will represent their interests rather than the middle class and working families. I'm running because we need to address the planetary crisis of climate change and take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.I'm running for president because I want a new foreign policy; one that takes on Isis, one that destroys ISIS, but one that does not get us involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East but rather works around a major coalition of wealthy and powerful nations supporting Muslim troops on the ground. That's the kind of coalition we need and that's the kind of coalition I will put together. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~He sure did.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~I'm one of the 77 percent. I think this is a very difficult issue. Let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said. Let me tell you what I think we have got to do. I think it's a two-pronged issue.Number one, our goal is to crush and destroy ISIS. What is the best way to do it? Well, I think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself. I voted against the war in Iraq because I thought unilateral military action would not produce the results that were necessary and would lead to the kind of unraveling and instability that we saw in the Middle East.I do not believe in unilateral American action. I believe in action in which we put together a strong coalition of forces, major powers and the Muslim nations. I think one of the heroes in a real quagmire out there, in a dangerous and difficult world; one of the heroes who we should recognize in the Middle East is King Abdullah II of Jordan. This small country has welcomed in many refugees.And Abdullah said something recently, very important. He said, &quot;Yes, international terrorism is by definition an international issue, but it is primarily an issue of the Muslim nations who are fighting for the soul of Islam. We the Muslims should lead the effort on the ground.&quot; And I believe he is absolutely right.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~I can tell you that adding up the fact you're not paying any private insurance, businesses are not paying any private insurance. The average middle-class family will be saving thousands of dollars a year.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~I happen to think
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~I have a difference of opinion with Secretary Clinton on this. Our differences are fairly deep on this issue. We disagreed on the war in Iraq. We both listened to the information from Bush and Cheney. I voted against the war.But I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.Yes, we could get rid of Saddam Hussein, but that destabilized the entire region. Yes, we could get rid of Gadhafi, a terrible dictator, but that created a vacuum for ISIS. Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS. So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy. But before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after. And in my view, what we need to do is put together broad coalitions to understand that we're not going to have a political vacuum filled by terrorists, that, in fact, we are going to move steadily -- and maybe slowly -- toward democratic societies, in terms of Assad, a terrible dictator. But I think in Syria the primary focus now must be on destroying ISIS and working over the years to get rid of Assad. That's the secondary issue.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~I have a problem with that, Martha. What I believe has got to happen is there must be an international coalition, including Russia, a well-coordinated effort.But I agree, as I mentioned a moment ago, with King Abdullah. This is a war for the soul of Islam. The troops on the ground should not be American troops. They should be Muslim troops. I believe that countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have got to step up to the plate, have got to contribute the money that we need, and the troops that we need, to destroy ISIS with American support.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~I was not the secretary of state
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~I would just
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~It's a country in which people choose to buy guns. I think half of the -- more than half of the people in my own state of Vermont, my guess here in New Hampshire, are gun owners. That's the right of people.But this is what I do believe. I believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country, I believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings, not only in San Bernardino, but in Colorado and movie theaters in Colorado, I think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations.For example, talking about polls, a poll recently came out, overwhelming majority of the American people say we should strengthen the instant background check. Who denies that it is crazy  [applause]Who denies that it is crazy to allow people to own guns who are criminals or are mentally unstable? We've got to eliminate the gun show loophole. In my view, we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians.I think there is a consensus. [applause]I think -- I'm not going to say that everybody is in agreement. It's a divided country on guns. But there is a broad consensus on sensible gun safety regulations that I, coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, will do my best to bring together.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~It means that we have to rethink the so-called war on drugs which has destroyed the lives of millions of people, which is why I have taken marijuana out of the Controlled Substance Act. So that it will not be a federal crime.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Let me agree with Governor O'Malley and let me agree with Secretary Clinton. You know, we had this incident before, Secretary, with your famous e-mails. Right?And what I said and I think what Governor O'Malley is saying, and I hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues. Media notwithstanding.Those are the issues that the American people want discussed. I hope those are the issues we'll discuss.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Let me just -- let me just
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Let me just jump in. My name was invoked.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Let me respond to
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Let me respond to  [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Look, the secretary is right. This is a terribly complicated issue. There are no simple solutions. But where we have a disagreement is that I think if you look at the history of regime changes, you go back to Mossadegh in Iran, you go back to Salvador Allende who we overthrew in Chile, you go back to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq, you go back to where we are today in Syria with a dictator named Assad.The truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like America to overthrow a dictator but it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator.So I think Secretary Clinton and I have a fundamental disagreement. I'm not quite the fan of regime change that I believe she is.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~May I respond to the critique on the
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~My plan is to make it work, to tell Saudi Arabia that instead of going to war in Yemen, they, one of the wealthiest countries on Earth, are going to have to go to war against ISIS.To tell Qatar, that instead of spending $200 billion on the World Cup, maybe they should pay attention to ISIS, which is at their doorstep. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~No, I think they won't. [laughter and applause]So Hillary and I have a difference. The CEOs of large multinationals may like Hillary. They ain't going to like me and Wall Street is going to like me even less. [applause]And the reason for that is we've got to deal with the elephant in the room, which is the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street. When you have six financial institutions in this country that issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages, when three out of four of them are larger today than when we bailed them out because they are too big to fail, we've got to re- establish Glass-Steagall, we have got to break the large financial institutions up.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Not only -- not only do I apologize to Secretary Clinton -- and I hope we can work together on an independent investigation from day one -- I want to apologize to my supporters. This is not the type of campaign that we run.And if I find anybody else involved in this, they will also be fired.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Now, this is getting to be fun.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Number one, most important economic reality of today is that over the last 30 years, there has been a transfer of trillions of dollars from the middle class to the top one-tenth of one percent who are seeing a doubling of the percentage of wealth that they own.Now, when Secretary Clinton says, &quot;I'm not going raise taxes on the middle class,&quot; let me tell you what she is saying. She is disagreeing with FDR on Social Security, LBJ on Medicare and with the vast majority of progressive Democrats in the House and the Senate, who today are fighting to end the disgrace of the United States being the only major country on Earth that doesn't provide paid family and medical leave.What the legislation is is $1.61 a week. Now, you can say that's a tax on the middle class. It will provide three months paid family and medical leave for the working families of this country. I think, Secretary Clinton, $1.61 a week is a pretty good investment.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Of course the United States must lead. But the United States is not the policeman of the world. The United States must not be involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East. The United States, at the same time, cannot successfully fight Assad and ISIS.ISIS, now, is the major priority. Let's get rid of Assad later. Let's have a Democratic Syria. But the first task is to bring countries together to destroy ISIS.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Secretary Clinton is right. This is a complicated issue. I don't think anyone has a magical solution.But this is what I do believe. Yes, of course Assad is a terrible dictator. But I think we have got to get our foreign policies and priorities right. The immediate -- it is not Assad who is attacking the United States. It is ISIS. And ISIS is attacking France and attacking Russian airliners.The major priority, right now, in terms of our foreign and military policy should be the destruction of ISIS. [applause]And I think -- and I think we bring together that broad coalition, including Russia, to help us destroy ISIS. And work on a timetable to get rid of Assad, hopefully through Democratic elections. First priority, destroy ISIS.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~So I don't think  [applause]  having said that, I don't think I'm going to get a whole lot of campaign contributions from Wall Street. I don't have a super PAC. I don't want campaign contributions from corporate America.And let me be clear: While there are some great corporations creating jobs and trying to do the right thing, in my view -- and I say this very seriously -- the greed of the billionaire class, the greed of Wall Street is destroying this economy and is destroying the lives of millions of Americans. We need an economy that works for the middle class, not just a handful of billionaires, and I will fight and lead to make that happen.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~So with that invocation, let me say a few words. [laughter]Secretary Clinton, I don't have a super PAC. I don't get any money from Wall Street. You have gotten a whole lot of money over the years from Wall Street. But most importantly, when you look at what happened in the 1990s, go to berniesanders.com. I'll advertise my Web site as well. [laughter]And what you'll find is that I led -- helped lead the effort as a member of the House financial committee against Alan Greenspan, against a guy named Bill Clinton, maybe you know him, maybe you don't. [laughter]Against the Republican leadership, who all thought it would be a great idea to merge investor banks and commercial banks and large insurance companies. What a brilliant idea that would be.Go to YouTube. Find out what I said to Greenspan. At the end of the day, if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, and the governor makes a good point about trade, anti-trade, anti-monopoly activities.Wall Street today has too much political power. It has too much economic power. To get deregulated -- listen to this, they spent $5 billion in lobbying and campaign contributions over a 10-year period.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Sure did. All right. First off, we can do all the great speeches we want but you're not going to succeed unless there is a consensus. In 1988, just to set the record straight governor, I ran for the U.S. House. We have one House member from Vermont, three candidates in the race. One candidate said, you know what, I don't think it's a great idea that we sell automatic weapons in this country that are used by the military to kill people very rapidly.Gun people said, there were three candidates in the race, you vote for one of the others, but not Bernie Sanders. I lost that election by three percentage points. Quite likely, for that reason. So please, do not explain to me, coming from a state where democratic governors and republican governors have supported virtually no gun control. [crosstalk]Excuse me. Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people, in voting to ban assault weapons, voting for instant background checks, voting to end the gun show loop hole and now we're in a position to create a consensus in America on gun safety. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~That is why we need to make  [applause]That is why we need to make police -- and I speak as a former mayor. I was a mayor for eight years, worked very closely with a great police department. And what we did is try to move that department toward community policing, so that the police officers become part of the community and not, as we see, in some cities an oppressive force.We need to make police departments look like the communities they serve in terms of diversity. We need to end minimal sentencing. We need, basically, to pledge that we're going to invest in this country, in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Then (inaudible)
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Wall Street is a threat to the economy. They've got to be broken up. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Well, Neil, I think we've got to work on a two-pronged approach. And your point is absolutely well taken. The cost of college education is escalating a lot faster than the cost of inflation. There are a lot of factors involved in that.And that is that we have some colleges and universities that are spending a huge amount of money on fancy dormitories and on giant football stadiums. Maybe we should focus on quality education with well-paid faculty members. But  [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Well, thank you very much for hosting this debate, and let me applaud my colleagues up here. Because I think frankly, maybe I'm wrong, but on our worst day, I think we have a lot more to offer the American people than the right wing's extremists. [applause] My father came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, which sparked my interest in the need for immigration reform because I know what it's like to be the son of an immigrant.We grew up in a three-and-a-half-room, rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York. My mother's dream -- and she died very young, but my mother's dream for her whole life was to be able to get out of that rent-controlled apartment and own a home of her own. She never lived to see that.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Well, the answer is, obviously, if you see suspicious activity, you report it. That's kind of a no-brainer. You know, somebody is loading guns and ammunition into a house, I think it's a good idea to call 911. Do it. [laughter]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Well, this whole issue concerns me. And I agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said. But let's be clear. Today in America we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, 2.2 million people. Predominantly African-American and Hispanic.We are spending $80 billion a year locking up our fellow Americans. I think, and this is not easy, but I think we need to make wage a major effort, to come together as a country and end institutional racism. We need major, major reforms of a very broken criminal justice system. Now, what does that mean?Well, for a start it means that police officers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly African-Americans. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's calm down a little bit, Martin.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Why is it that we are -- why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the U.K., 50 percent more than what they pay in France, countries that guarantee health care to all of their people and in many cases, have better health care outcomes. Bottom line.This ties into campaign finance reform. The insurance companies, the drug companies are bribing the United States Congress. We need to pass a Medicare for all single payer system. It will lower the cost of health care for a middle-class family by thousands of dollars a year.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Yeah, but the rule includes equal -- got it. All right. [laughter]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Yeah.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Yes, exactly, exactly.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Yes, I apologize.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Yes, well, roughly. Let me say this. As a member of the Health Education Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act, much of what Secretary Clinton said about what we have done, among other things, ending the obscenity of this pre-existing situation is a step forward.Seventeen more million more people have health care. It is a step forward. A step forward.But this is what we also have to say. Not only are deductibles rising, 29 million Americans still have no health insurance and millions of people can't afford to go to the doctor. Major crisis and primary health care. Here is the bottom line. Why is it that the United States of America today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?Why is it  [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Yes. Look, this is a tragedy for New Hampshire. It is a tragedy for my state of Vermont. It is a tragedy all over this country. The number of heroin deaths are growing very, very significantly.What do we do? Well, for a start, this may seem like a radical idea, but I think we have got to tell the medical profession and doctors who are prescribing opiates and the pharmaceutical industry that they have got to start getting their act together, we cannot have this huge number of opiates out there throughout this country, where young people are taking them, getting hooked, and then going to heroin.Second of all, and the reason I believe in a health care for all program, we need to understand that addiction is a disease, not a criminal activity. [applause]And that means -- and that means radically changing the way we deal with mental health and addiction issues. When somebody is addicted and seeking help, they should not have to wait three, four months in order to get that help. They should be able to walk in the door tomorrow and get a variety of treatments that work for them.So those are some of the areas that I think we've got to move on.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~And my analysis is that you are going to get more taxes out of middle class families. I'm the only person
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~And that is important, because now we have a U.N. Security Council that will enable us to do that. And, you know, with all due respect, Senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya. You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gadhafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution.All of these are very difficult issues. I know that; I've been dealing with them for a long time. And, of course, we have to continue to do what is necessary when someone like Gadhafi, a despot with American blood on his hands, is overturned. But I'll tell you what would have happened, if we had not joined with our European partners and our Arab partners to assist the people in Libya, you would be looking at Syria. Now the Libyans are turning their attention to try to dislodge ISIS from its foothold and begin to try to move together to have a unified nation.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~And we finally have a U.N. Security Council Resolution bringing the world together to go after a political transition in Syria.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~And we have to lead, if we're going to be successful. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Everybody should. [laughter and applause]Look, I have said I want to be the president for the struggling, the striving and the successful. I want to make sure the wealthy pay their fair share, which they have not been doing. I want the Buffett Rule to be in effect, where millionaires have to pay 30 percent tax rates instead of 10 percent to nothing in some cases. I want to make sure we rein in the excessive use of political power to feather the nest and support the super wealthy.But I also want to create jobs and I want to be a partner with the private sector. I'm particularly keen on creating jobs in small business. My dad was a small businessman, a really small business. I want to do more to help incentivize and create more small businesses. So if -- if people who are in the private sector know what I stand for, it's what I fought for as a senator, it's what I will do as president, and they want to be part of once again building our economy so it works for everybody, more power to them, because they are the kind of business leaders who understand that if we don't get the American economy moving and growing, we're not going to recognize our country and we're not going to give our kids the same opportunities that we had.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~family leave for a very long time
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~He invoked mine as well.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~hillaryclinton.com, and read about it. But I guess the final thing that -- that I would say is this is the kind of debate we need to take to the Republicans in the fall.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~I'm getting to that. Because I think if you only think about the coalition abroad you're missing the main point, which is we need a coalition here at home. Guns, in and of themselves, in my opinion, will not make Americans safer. We lose 33,000 people a year already to gun violence, arming more people to do what I think is not the appropriate response to terrorism.I think what is  [applause]Is creating much deeper, closer relations and, yes, coalitions within our own country. The first line of defense against radicalization is in Muslim-American community. People who we should be welcoming and working with.I worry greatly that the rhetoric coming from the Republicans, particularly Donald Trump, is sending a message to Muslims here in the United States and literally around the world that there is a &quot;clash of civilizations,&quot; that there is some kind of Western plot or even &quot;war against Islam,&quot; which then I believe fans the flames of radicalization.So guns have to be looked at as its own problem, but we also have to figure out how we're going to deal with the radicalization here in the United States. [crosstalk]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~I am advocating the no-fly zone both because I think it would help us on the ground to protect Syrians; I'm also advocating it because I think it gives us some leverage in our conversations with Russia.Now that Russia has joined us in the Security Council, has adopted an agreement that we hashed out a long day in Geneva three years ago, now I think we can have those conversations. The no-fly zone, I would hope, would be also shared by Russia. If they will begin to turn their military attention away from going after the adversaries of Assad toward ISIS and put the Assad future on the political and diplomatic track, where it belongs. [crosstalk]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~I do and this is an important issue and I know we'll get to a lot of other critical ones as well. I actually agree with Governor O'Malley about the need for common sense gun safety measures. And I applaud his record in Maryland. I just wish he wouldn't misrepresent mine. I have been for the Brady bill, I have been against assault weapons.I have voted not to give gun makers and sellers immunity. And I also know that -- and I'm glad to see this -- Senator Sanders has really moved in face of the facts about what we're confronting in our country. I know that he has said in the two previous that he wants to take on this immunity issue because we need to send a strong message to the gun manufacturers, to the sellers, to the gun lobby.And I would hope, Senator Sanders, that you would join the Democrats who are trying to close the Charleston loophole, that you would sponsor or co-sponsor legislation to remove the absolute immunity. We need to move on this consensus that exists in the country. It's no longer enough just to say the vast majority of Americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners.We need, and only the three of us will do this, nobody on the Republican side will even admit there's a problem. And in whatever way the three of us can we need to move this agenda forward and begin to deal with the gun lobby and the intimidation that they present. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~I do not think it would come to that. We are already de-conflicting air space. We know
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~I don't think a halt is necessary. What we have to do is put all of our resources through the Department of Homeland Security, through the State Department, through our intelligence agencies, and we have to have an increased vetting and screening. Now, this takes, David, 18 months to 24 months, two years.So I know it's not going to happen overnight and everything that can be done should be done. But the process should move forward while we are also taking on ISIS, putting together the kind of strategy that I've advocated for, and making sure that the vetting and the screening is as tough as possible. Because I do believe that we have a history and a tradition, that is part of our values system and we don't want to sacrifice our values.We don't want to make it seem as though we are turning into a nation of fear instead of a nation of resolve. So I want us to have a very tough screening process but I want that process to go forward. And if at the end of 18 months, 24 months there are people who have been cleared, and I would prioritize widows, and orphans, and the elderly, people who may have relatives, families, or have nowhere else to go. I would prioritize them.And that would I think give the American public a bit more of a sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~I have a way to pay for it that actually makes the wealthiest pay for it
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~I just think there's got to be a way, and I would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out. Otherwise, law enforcement is blind -- blind before, blind during, and, unfortunately, in many instances, blind after.So we always have to balance liberty and security, privacy and safety, but I know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe. And that's what I hope, there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~I think we're missing the point here. We are doing both at the same time.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~I very much appreciate that comment, Bernie. It really is important that we go forward on this.I know that you now have your data back, and that there has been an agreement for an independent inquiry into what did happen.Obviously, we were distressed when we learned of it, because we have worked very hard -- I said in the beginning of this campaign, we want to reach as many voters as possible, and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that, and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us.And so, now that, I think, you know, we have resolved your data, we have agreed on an independent inquiry, we should move on. Because I don't think the American people are all that interested in this. [applause]I think they're more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~I would not want to go to that point. I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries, they've got to be partners.It doesn't do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after. There must be some way. I don't know enough about the technology, Martha, to be able to say what it is, but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts.And maybe the back door is the wrong door, and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that. But I also understand, when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks -- to go back to our early questions, how do we prevent attacks -- well, if we can't know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or, you know, the member of the mosque or the teacher, somebody to see something.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~If the United States does not lead, there is not another leader. There is a vacuum.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~issues they have to respond to.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~It is. Because part of this is the startup challenges that this system is facing. We have fought, as Democrats, for decades to get a health care plan. I know. I've got the scars to show from the effort back in the early '90s.We want to build on it and fix it. And I'm confident we can do that. And it will have effects in the private market. And one of the reasons in some states why the percentage cost has gone up so much is because governors there would not extend Medicaid.And so people are still going to get health care, thankfully, in emergency rooms, in hospitals. Those costs are then added to the overall cost, which does increase the insurance premiums for people in the private system. [crosstalk]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Let me respond
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Martha, that -- you know, one of the reasons why I have advocated for a no-fly zone is in order to create those safe refuges within Syria, to try to protect people on the ground both from Assad's forces, who are continuing to drop barrel bombs, and from ISIS. And of course, it has to be de-conflicted with the Russians, who are also flying in that space.I'm hoping that because of the very recent announcement of the agreement at the Security Council, which embodies actually an agreement that I negotiated back in Geneva in June of 2012, we're going to get a diplomatic effort in Syria to begin to try to make a transition. A no-fly zone would prevent the outflow of refugees and give us a chance to have some safe spaces.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Martha, we offered a lot more than they were willing to take. We offered a lot more. We also got rid of their chemical weapons, which was a big help, and we also went after a lot of the shoulder-fired missiles to round them up. You know, we can't -- if we're not going to send American troops, which there was never any idea of doing that, then to try to send trainers, to try to send experts, is something we offered, Europeans offered, the U.N. offered, and there wasn't a lot of responsiveness at first.I think a lot of the Libyans who had been forced out of their country by Gadhafi who came back to try to be part of a new government, believed they knew what to do and it turned out that they were no match for some of the, you know, militaristic forces inside that country. But I'm not giving up on Libya and I don't think anybody should. We've been at this a couple of years.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~No, I don't think so. I am advocating
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~No. Not at all. I think that what we're facing with ISIS is especially complicated. It was a different situation in Afghanistan. We were attacked from Afghanistan. Al Qaida was based in Afghanistan. We went after those who had attacked us.What's happening in Syria and Iraq is that, because of the failures in the region, including the failure of the prior government in Baghdad, led by Maliki, there has been a resurgence of Sunni activities, as exemplified by ISIS. And we have to support Sunni-Arab and Kurdish forces against ISIS, because I believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the United States to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what ISIS wants.They've advertised that. They want American troops back in the Middle East. They want American soldiers on the ground fighting them, giving them many more targets, and giving them a great recruiting opportunity.  So, I think it's absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of American troops into Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS.And we do have to form a coalition. I know how hard that is. I have formed them. I put together a coalition, including Arabs, with respect to Libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto Iran. And you have to really work hard at it.And the final thing I would say, bringing Donald Trump back into it, if you're going to put together a coalition in the region to take on the threat of ISIS you don't want to alienate the very countries and people you need to be part of the coalition. And so that is part of the reason why this is so difficult. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~not everybody else.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Number one, there are currently two hedge fund billionaires running ads against me here in New Hampshire. They started in Iowa. Now, you'd have to ask yourself, why are they running ads against me? And the answer is: Because they know I will go right after them, that I will not let their agenda be America's agenda.Secondly, I think it's important to point out that about 3 percent of my donations come from people in the finance and investment world. You can go to opensecrets.org and check that. I have more donations from students and teachers than I do from people associated with Wall Street. [applause]Now, number three -- and let me say this -- when Governor O'Malley was heading the Democratic Governors Association, he had no trouble at all going to Wall Street to raise money to run campaigns for Democratic governors. And he also had no trouble appointing an investment banker to be in charge of his consumer protection bureau when he was governor.So, you know, again, the difference between us and the Republicans is night and day. And there is only one person on this stage who voted to take away authority from the SEC and the Commodities Future Trading Commission that they could no longer regulate what are called swaps and derivatives, which actually contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and that was Senator Sanders.So if we're going to be talking like this, we can -- and maybe we can score some political points -- but the fact is: Every one of us stands for the kind of economy that will work better for every American. And if that means taking on Wall Street, I have a plan that is tough and comprehensive and praised by a lot of folks who say it goes further than what both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley are proposing.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~OK
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~On January 20th, 2017, the next president of the United States will walk into the White House. If, heaven forbid, that next president is a Republican, I think it's pretty clear we know what will happen. A lot of the rights that have been won over years, from women's rights to voter rights to gay rights to worker rights, will be at risk.Social Security, which Republicans call a Ponzi scheme, may face privatization. Our vets may see the V.A. hospital that needs to be improved and made better for them turned over to privatization. Planned Parenthood will be defunded. The list goes on because the differences are so stark.You know, everybody says every election's important, and there's truth to that. This is a watershed election. I know how important it is that we have a Democrat succeed President Obama in the White House. And I will do all that I can in this campaign to reach out and explain what I stand for and what I will do as president.You know, I became a grandmother 15 months ago, and so I spent a lot of time thinking about my granddaughter's future. But as president, I will spend even more time thinking about the futures of all the kids and the grandchildren in this country because I want to make sure every single child has a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. If you will join me in this campaign, we will make that a mission. Thank you, good night and may the force be with you. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Right.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~saying, no middle class tax raises. That's off the table
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Senator, I have been -- I have been fighting for paid
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Since he has been making all kinds of comments. [laughter]I think it's fair to say, Assad has killed, by last count, about 250,000 Syrians. The reason we are in the mess we're in, that ISIS has the territory it has, is because of Assad.I advocated arming the moderate opposition back in the day when I was still secretary of State, because I worried we would end up exactly where we are now.And so, when we look at these complex problems, I wish it could be either/or. I wish we could say yes, let's go destroy ISIS and let's let Assad continue to destroy Syria, which creates more terrorists, more extremists by the minute.No. We now finally are where we need to be. We have a strategy and a commitment to go after ISIS, which is a danger to us as well as the region  SANDERS (?): Secretary
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Sorry.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~That is a pledge that I'm making. I made it when I ran in 2008.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~That is exactly
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~That is exactly what I just said and what I just described.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~This is the election
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Under the rules, I have been -- I have been invoked, David, so let me respond very quickly. Number one
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Wait a minute. I think it's only fair to put on the record, Senator Sanders voted in the Senate for a resolution calling for ending the Gadhafi regime and asking that the U.N. be brought in, either a congressional vote or a U.N. Security Council vote. We got a U.N. Security council vote.Now, I understand that this is very difficult. And I'm not standing here today and saying that Libya is as far along as Tunisia. We saw what happened in Egypt. I cautioned about a quick overthrow of Mubarak, and we now are back with basically an army dictatorship.This is a part of the world where the United States has tried to play two different approaches. One, work with the tough men, the dictators, for our own benefit and promote democracy. That's a hard road to walk. But I think it's the right road for us to try to travel.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Well I think a lot of people are understandably reacting out of fear and anxiety about what they're seeing. First what they saw in Paris, now what they have seen in San Bernardino. And Mr. Trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make think there are easy answers to very complex questions.So what I would say is, number one, we need to be united against the threats that we face. We need to have everybody in our country focused on watching what happens and reporting it if it's suspicious, reporting what you hear. Making sure that Muslim Americans don't feel left out or marginalized at the very moment when we need their help.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Well, David, I think this is one of the most important challenges facing not just our next president but our country. We have systemic racism and injustice and inequities in our country and in particular, in our justice system that must be addressed and must be ended.I feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect. Trust has been totally lost in a lot of places.At the same time, we know that in many parts of our country police officers are bridging those divides and they're acting heroically. The young officer who was killed responding to the Planned Parenthood murders. The officer who told the victims of the San Bernardino killings that he would take a bullet before them.So I think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impaneled. We need to get a bipartisan commitment to work together on this.And we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who feel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not only deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system, but more opportunities, more jobs, better education so that we can begin to rebuild that very valuable asset known as trust.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Well, first, let's remember why we became part of a coalition to stop Gadhafi from committing massacres against his people. The United States was asked to support the Europeans and the Arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, I recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of Gadhafi.I think that what Libya then did by having a full free election, which elected moderates, was an indication of their crying need and desire to get on the right path. Now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the Arab Spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that ISIS and other terrorist groups do.But what we're seeing happening in Libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among Libyans themselves to try to dislodge ISIS from Sirte, the home town of Gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government.You know, this is not easy work. We did a lot to help. We did as much as we could because the Libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept. But we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Well, first, the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of America safe.I have a plan that I've put forward to go after ISIS. Not to contain them, but to defeat them. And it has three parts. First, to go after them and deprive them of the territory they occupy now in both Syria and Iraq.Secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism. And thirdly, to do more to keep us safe. Under each of those three parts of my plan, I have very specific recommendations about what to do.Obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an American-led air campaign, we have to have Arab and Kurdish troops on the ground. Secondly, we've got to go after everything from North Africa to South Asia and beyond.And then, most importantly, here at home, I think there are three things that we have to get right. We have to do the best possible job of sharing intelligence and information. That now includes the internet, because we have seen that ISIS is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence.That means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies. They can't see the government as an adversary, we can't see them as obstructionists. We've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning.And we must work more closely with Muslim-American communities. Just like Martin, I met with a group of Muslim-Americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization. They will be our early warning signal. That's why we need to work with them, not demonize them, as the Republicans have been doing.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Well, I've been talking to a lot of these families, and this is such an outrage, both because it's bad for our economy, we're a 70 percent consumption economy, people need to feel optimistic and confident, they need to believe their hard work is going to be rewarded, and it's bad for our democracy. It's absolutely the case that if people feel that the game is rigged, that has consequences.I think it's great standing up here with the senator and the governor talking about these issues, because you're not going to hear anything like this from any of the Republicans who are running for president. [applause]They don't want to raise the minimum wage; they don't want to do anything to increase incomes. At the center of my economic policy is raising incomes, because people haven't been able to get ahead, and the cost of everything, from college tuition to prescription drugs, has gone up.Of course we have to raise the minimum wage. Of course we have to do more to incentivize profit sharing, like we see with Market Basket right here in New Hampshire and New England, where all of the employees get a chance to share in the profits. [applause]And we've got to do more on equal pay for equal work. That means pass the Paycheck Fairness Act so we have transparency about how much people are making. That's the way to get women's wages up, and that's good for them and good for their families and good for our communities. [applause]And there is a lot we can do in college affordability. I have debt-free tuition plans, free community college plans, getting student debt down. I also am very committed to getting the price of drugs down. And there's a lot. You can go to my website
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Well, I agree that we have to have the toughest screening and vetting
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Well, I don't agree with that, because we will not get the support on the ground in Syria to dislodge ISIS if the fighters there who are not associated with ISIS, but whose principal goal is getting rid of Assad, don't believe there is a political, diplomatic channel that is ongoing. We now have that. We have the U.N. Security Council adopting a resolution that lays out a transition path. It's very important we operate on both at the same time.And let me just say a word about coalition-building, because I've heard Senator Sanders say this. I know how hard it is to build coalitions. I think it would be a grave mistake to ask for any more Iranian troops inside Syria. That is like asking the arsonist to come and pour more gas on the fire.The Iranians getting more of a presence in Syria, linking with Hezbollah, their proxy in Lebanon, would threaten Israel and would make it more difficult for us to move on a path to have a transition that at some point would deal with Assad's future. [crosstalk]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Well, I have what I call the new college compact. Because I think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know.Number one, States have been dis-investing in higher education. In fact, I think New Hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country. So states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education. So under my compact, the federal government will match money that the states begin to put back in to the higher education system.Secondly, I don't believe in free tuition for everybody. I believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead. So I have proposed debt free tuition, which I think is affordable and I would move a lot of the Pell Grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense. So I put all of this together, again, on my website and I've gotten such a good response.But I want to quickly say, one of the areas that Senator Sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems. Free college, a single payer system for health--and it's been estimated we're looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget.And I have looked at his proposed plans for health care for example, and it really does transfer every bit of our health care system including private health care, to the states to have the states run. And I think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that I have proposed I will tell you exactly how I'm going to pay for it; including college.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Well, I just think you're asking a question with a false choice. I believe if we lead an air coalition, which we are now in the position of doing and intensify it, if we continue to build back up the Iraqi army, which has had some recent success in Ramadi, as you know, if we get back talking to the tribal sheiks in Anbar to try to rebuild those relationships, which were very successful, in going after Al Qaida in Iraq, if we get the Turks to pay more attention to ISIS than they're paying to the Kurds, if we do put together the kind of coalition with the specific tasks that I am outlining, I think we can be successful in destroying ISIS.So that's what I'm focused on, that's what I've outlined and that's what I would do as president.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Well, I just want to quickly add
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Well, I think you have to look at both the terrorism challenge that we face abroad and certainly at home and the role that guns play in delivering the violence that stalks us. Clearly, we have to have a very specific set of actions to take. You know, when Senator Sanders talks about a coalition, I agree with him about that. We've got to build a coalition abroad. We also have to build a coalition at home. Abroad, we need a coalition that is going to take on ISIS. I know how hard that is. I know it isn't something you just hope people will do and I've worked on that
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Well, I would certainly build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the glitches that you just referenced.Number one, we do have more people who have access to health care. We have ended the terrible situation that people with pre- existing conditions were faced with where they couldn't find at any affordable price health care.Women are not charged more than men any longer for our health insurance. And we keep young people on our policies until they turn 26. [applause]Those are all really positive developments. But out-of-pocket costs have gone up too much and prescription drug costs have gone through the roof. And so what I have proposed, number one, is a $5,000 tax credit to help people who have very large out-of-pocket costs be able to afford those.Number two, I want Medicare to be able to negotiate for lower drug prices just like they negotiate with other countries' health systems. [applause]We end up paying the highest prices in the world. And I want us to be absolutely clear about making sure the insurance companies in the private employer policy arena as well as in the Affordable Care exchanges are properly regulated so that we are not being gamed.And I think that's an important point to make because I'm going through and analyzing the points you were making, Martha. We don't have enough competition and we don't have enough oversight of what the insurance companies are charging everybody right now. [crosstalk]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Well, I would just repeat that.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Well, thank you. And I'm delighted to be here in New Hampshire for this debate.You know, the American president has to both keep our families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone, not just those at the top. That's the job. I have a strategy to combat and defeat ISIS without getting us involved in another ground war, and I have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night.I'm very clear that we have a distinct difference between those of us on this stage tonight and all of our Republican counterparts. From my perspective, we have to prevent the Republicans from rolling back the progress that we've made. They would repeal the Affordable Care Act, not improve it. They would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and corporations, not to the middle class. And they would, despite all their tough talk about terrorism, continue to let people who are on the no-fly list buy guns.So we have a lot of work to do in this campaign to make it clear where we stand in the Democratic Party, what we will do for our country, and I look forward to this evening's discussion of real issues that face the American people.Thank you.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Well, the only thing - the only thing I can go on Senator Sanders
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Well, the role has been defined by each person who's held it. And I am very grateful for all my predecessors and my successors because each of them not only did what she could to support her husband and our country but often chose to work on important issues that were of particular concern.Obviously, Mrs. Obama has been a terrific leader when it comes to young people's health, particularly nutrition and exercise. And I think has had a big impact. So whoever is part of the family of a president has an extraordinary privilege of not only having a front row seat on history but making her or maybe his contribution.And with respect to my own husband, I am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china for state dinners and stuff like that. But I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions, for advice, and in particular, how we're going to get the economy working again for everybody, which he knows a little bit about.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Well, there's always a retrospective to say what mistakes were made. But I know that we offered a lot of help and I know it was difficult for the Libyans to accept help. What we could have done if they had said yes would have been a lot more than what we were able to have done.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Well, they're glitches because
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Yes, and it was the same one that President Obama made. Because I don't think we should be imposing new big programs that are going to raise middle class families' taxes.We just heard that most families haven't had a wage increase since 2001. Since, you know, the end of the last Clinton administration when incomes did go up for everybody. And we've got to get back to where people can save money again, where they can invest in their families, and I don't think a middle-class tax should be part of anybody's plan right now.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Yes, I'm getting
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Yes, let's tell the truth, Martin.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Yes.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~You know, I was a senator from New York after 9/11, and we spent countless hours trying to figure out how to protect the city and the state from perhaps additional attacks. One of the best things that was done, and George W. Bush did this and I give him credit, was to reach out to Muslim Americans and say, we're in this together. You are not our adversary, you are our partner.And we also need to make sure that the really discriminatory messages that Trump is sending around the world don't fall on receptive ears. He is becoming ISIS's best recruiter. They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists. So I want to explain why this is not in America's interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~You know, on my very first visit to New Hampshire in this campaign, I was in Keene, and I was asked, &quot;what are you going to do about the heroin epidemic?&quot; And all over New Hampshire, I met grandmothers who are raising children because they lost the father or the mother to an overdose. I met young people who are desperately trying to get clean and have nowhere to go, because there are not enough facilities.So this is a major epidemic, and it has hit New Hampshire and Vermont particularly hard. I've had had two town halls, one in Keene, one in Laconia, dedicated exclusively to talking about what we can do. And I've heard some great ideas about how law enforcement is changing its behavior, how the recovery community is reaching out.And I was proud to get the endorsement of Mayor Walsh of Boston, who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena.So, I've laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together. I would like the federal government to offer $10 billion over ten years to work with states, and I really applaud Governor Hassan for taking up this challenge and working with the legislature here to come up with a plan.We need to do more on the prescribing end of it. There are too many opioids being prescribed, and that leads directly now to heroin addiction. And we need to change the way we do law enforcement, and of course, we need more programs and facilities, so when somebody is ready to get help, there's a place for them to go.And every law enforcement should carry the antidote to overdose, Naloxone, so that they can save lives that are on the brink of expiring.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Your proposal is to go and send the health care system to the state.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~and in this case, we probably let our lust for regime toppling get ahead of the practical considerations for stability in that region. And I believe that one of the big failings in that region is a lack of human intelligence. We have not made the investments that we need to make to understand and to have relationships with future leaders that are coming up.That's what Chris Stevens was trying to do. But without the tools, without the support that was needed to that. And now what we have is a whole stretch now, of the coast of Libya, 100 miles, 150 miles, that has now become potentially the next safe haven for ISIL. They go back and forth between Syria and this region. We have to stop contributing to the creation of vacuums that allow safe havens to develop.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~And Martha
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~And you know, I actually know a great deal about this issue. And I have a dear friend, played music with him for years, remember when his -- when he came home with his baby girl, and now she's no longer with us, because of addiction and overdose.The last time in New Hampshire, I had to take a break shortly after landing and call home and comfort a friend whose mother had died of an overdose.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Because, Martha, it would prevent people like the guy that just got charged yesterday perhaps from being able to buy combat assault weapons. You know, we are the only nation, only developed nation on the planet
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Can I share this quick story?
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~David, I am the very first
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~David, there are wider vulnerabilities than when it comes to refugees. I met recently with some members of the Chaldean Christian communities and the wait times are a year, 18 months, 24 months. There is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through. We need to invest more in terms of the other sort of visas and the other sort of waivers.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Drugs have taken far too many of our citizens. It's a huge public health challenge. In our own city, I mentioned before, we had become the most addicted city in America.But together, every single year, I expanded drug treatment funding within our city and then I expanded it in our state, and we were saving lives every single year doing the things that work, intervening earlier, understanding the continuum of care that's required until we got hit like every other state in the state -- in the United States, especially in New Hampshire and in the northeast with this opioid addiction, the over-prescribing.I agree, we need better -- we need to rein in the over- prescribing, but I have put forward on my -- in my plan a $12 billion federal investment. We have to invest in the local partnerships, and the best place to intervene, the best indicator of when a person is actually on the verge of killing themselves because of an addiction, is at the hospital. That very first time they show up with a near miss, we should be intervening there. That's what I said to my own public health people. What would we do if this were Ebola? How would we act?So many more Americans have been killed by the combination of heroin and these highly addictive pain pills, and yet, we refuse to act. There are thing that can be done. Go on to my website. My plan is there. It's one of 15 strategic goals I've set out to make our country a better place by cutting these sort of deaths in half in the next five years.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~During the Cold War -- during the Cold War, we got into a bad habit of always looking to see who was wearing the jersey of the communists, and who was wearing the U.S. jersey. We got into a bad habit of creating big bureaucracies, old methodologies, to undermine regimes that were not friendly to the United States. Look what we did in Iran with Mossadegh. And look at the results that we're still dealing with because of that. I would suggest to you that we need to leave the Cold War behind us, and we need to put together new alliances and new approaches to dealing with this, and we need to restrain ourselves.I mean, I know Secretary Clinton was gleeful when Gadhafi was torn apart. And the world, no doubt is a better place without him. But look, we didn't know what was happening next. And we fell into the same trap with Assad, saying -- as if it's our job to say, Assad must go.We have a role to play in this world. But we need to leave the Cold War and that sort of antiquated thinking behind.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Excuse me, no.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~I'd like to offer a  [applause]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~I am telling the truth.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~I am the only person on this stage who has actually
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~I am the very first post-9/11 mayor and the very first post-9/11 governor. I understand, from the ground up, that when attacks like San Bernardino happen, when attacks like the attacks of 9/11 happen, that when people call 911, the first people to show up are the local first responders.Many of the things Secretary Clinton said are absolutely true, but they underscore a lack of investment that we have, as a nation, failed to make over these last 15 years in intelligence gathering, intelligence analysis, intelligence sharing. Not only in theater, in Syria and Iraq and other places where we embalk [sic] ourselves in toppling dictators without having any idea what comes next, but here in the homeland, as we protect people from this threat of the lone wolves and these changing tactics and strategies.I believe that what's happened here is that the president had us on the right course, but it's a lack of battle tempo. We have to increase the battle tempo, we have to bring a modern way of getting things done and forcing the sharing of information and do a much better job of acting on it in order to prevent these sorts of attacks in the future.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~I believe that we need to focus on destroying ISIL. That is the clear and present danger. And I believe that we can springboard off of this new U.N. resolution, and we should create, as Secretary Clinton indicated, and I agree with that, that there should be a political process.But we shouldn't be the ones declaring that Assad must go. Where did it ever say in the Constitution, where is it written that it's the job of the United States of America or its secretary of State to determine when dictators have to go?We have a role to play in this world. But it is not the world -- the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy. [crosstalk]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~I believe that we should never give up our privacy; never should give up our freedoms in exchange for a promise of security. We need to figure this out together. We need a collaborative approach. We need new leadership.The way that things work in the modern era is actually to gather people around the table and figure these things out. The federal government should have to get warrants. That's not some sort of passé you know, antique sort of principle that safeguards our freedoms.But at the same time with new technologies I believe that the people creating these projects -- I mean these products also have an obligation to come together with law enforcement to figure these things out; true to our American principles and values.My friend Kashif, who is a doctor in Maryland; back to this issue of our danger as a democracy of turning against ourselves. He was putting his 10 and 12-year-old boys to bed the other night. And he is a proud American Muslim. And one of his little boys said to him, &quot;Dad, what happens if Donald Trump wins and we have to move out of our homes?&quot; These are very, very real issues. this is a clear and present danger in our politics within.We need to speak to what unites us as a people; freedom of worship, freedom of religion, freedom of expression. And we should never be convinced to give up those freedoms in exchange for a promise of greater security; especially from someone as untried and as incompetent as Donald Trump.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Look these are the things that we did in own state through the recession. We actually passed a living wage. We raised the minimum wage. We actually raised it to the highest goals of any state in the nation also in minority and women participant goals because we understood that the way you reinvigorate and make fair market American capitalism work, is to make the choices and the investments that include more people more full in the economic success of your state.All through the recession, we defended the highest median income in America and the second highest median income for African American families. How? By actually doing more for education. We increased education funding by 37 percent.We were the only state in American that went four years in a row without a penny increase in college tuition. We invested more in our infrastructure and we squared our shoulders to the great business opportunity of this era and that is moving our economy to a 100 percent clean electric energy future. We created 2,000 new jobs in the solar industry and we fought every single day to adopt more inclusive economic practices.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Look, I look at our economy as an ecosystem. And the fact of the matter is that the more fully people participate, the more our workers earn, the more they will spend, the more our economy will grow. And most heads of businesses -- large, medium and small -- understand that.But there is a better way forward than either of those offered by my two opponents here on this stage. We're not going to fix what ails our economy, we're not going to make wages go up for everyone by either trying to replace American capitalism with socialism -- which, by the way, the rest of the world is moving away from -- nor will we fix it by submitting to sort of Wall Street-directed crony capitalism.And for my part, I have demonstrated the ability to have the backbone to take on Wall Street in ways that Secretary Clinton never, ever has. In fact, in the last debate, very shamefully, she tried to hide her cozy relationship with Wall Street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9/11.I believe that the way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition. There's mergers that are happening in every aspect of our country that is bad for competition and it's bad for -- for upward mobility of wages.And the worst type of concentration, Secretary Clinton, is the concentration of the big banks, the big six banks that you went to and spoke to and told them, oh, you weren't responsible for the crash, not by a long shot.And that's why today you still cannot support, as I do, breaking up the big banks and making sure that we pass a modern-day Glass- Steagall, like we had in late 1999, before it was repealed and led to the crash, where so many millions of families lost their jobs and their homes. And I was on the front lines of that, looking into the eyes of my neighbors
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Martha -- I would just repeat that --
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Martha, if I may
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Martha, may I -- Martha, may I  [crosstalk]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Martha, thank you. I want to thank all of the people who have tuned in tonight. I want to thank the great people of New Hampshire, where despite all of the cynicism about big money and big banks taking over our politics, here in New Hampshire, the individual matters.You know, my wife Katie and I have four terrific kids, and like you, there's probably nothing we wouldn't do to give them a future that's safer, that's healthier, where they have more opportunity than our parents and grandparents gave to us. Tonight, what you listened to was a healthy exchange of ideas about how we'd do that, that which we have always proven, the capacity to do better than any nation in the world, to take actions that include more of our people more fully in the economic, social and political life of our country.When you listened to the Republican debate the other night, you heard a lot of anger and you had a lot of fear. Well, they can have their anger and they can have their fear, but anger and fear never built America. We build our country by adopting wage and labor policies, including comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway of citizenship for all. We do it by investing in our country, by investing in infrastructure, by investing in the skills and the talents of our people with debt-free college, and we can do it again.And we also create a better future for our kids when we square our shoulders to the great challenges of our times, whether it's terror trying to undermine our values or Republican presidential candidates trying to get us to surrender our freedoms and our values in the face of this threat.The other big challenge we have is climate change. The greatest business opportunity to come to the United States of America in 100 years. We need to embrace this. I have put forward a plan that does this, that moves us to 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050. Join this campaign for the future. New leadership is what our country needs to move us out of these divided and polarized times. Thank you.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Martha, thank you. Tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far, because tonight is different because of this reason, that in the course of this presidential campaign America has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists, American lives taken from us. So, yes, we must talk about our ideas to move our economy forward, but the first job of the president of the United States is to protect the people of the United States.I visited with a number of our neighbors in Northern Virginia at a mosque last Friday. And as I looked out there at the eyes of our neighbors, I also looked in the eyes of veterans. I looked into the eyes of Boy Scouts. I looked into the eyes of moms and dads who would do anything in their power to protect our country's values and our freedoms.What our nation needs right now is to realize that, while we face a terrible danger, we also face a different sort of political danger. And that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other. What our country needs right now is new leadership that will bring us together around the values that unite us and the freedoms that we share as Americans.We will rise to challenge of ISIL and we will rise together to the challenges that we face in our economy. But we will only do so if we hold true to the values and the freedoms that unite us, which means we must never surrender them to terrorists, must never surrender our Americans values to racist, must never surrender to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths.We are a better country than this. Our enduring symbol is not the barbed wire fence, it is the Statue of Liberty. And America's best days are in front of us if we move forward together. [applause]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~May I offer a different generation's perspective on this?
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~No, I've never made a promise like that. But unlike either of these two fine people, I've actually balanced a budget every single year. I was one -- I was the only -- one of only seven states that had a AAA bond rating. By the time I left, the average tax burden on Maryland families was the same as when I started.But I did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest-earning people to pay another 14 percent. David, look, this is the big -- I agree, by the way, that we should have paid family leave. And I agree with Senator Sanders on that. And just like Social Security and unlike the Republicans, I think we should actually expand Social Security and increase average monthly benefits.But look, there's one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country, and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us, those earning more than a million dollars, feel that they're entitled to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains.If we were to raise the marginal rate to 45 percent for people earning more than a million dollars and if we tax capital gains essentially the same we do earnings from hard work and sweat and toil, you could generate $800 billion over the next ten years and that would do so much good for affordable college, debt-free college, cutting youth unemployment in half, investing in our cities again.So the things I have done in office are the things that actually invest in growing our economy and making wages go up. That's the issue that we need to tackle as Americans, and we can do it and we know how.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~No, Martha, I would not. And that's not what we did in Maryland. But you know what we did in Maryland? We overcame the NRA's objections. We overcame all of the crowds that were coming down there.We did our own rallies. And at least if we enact these laws in a prospective way, we can address a major vulnerability in our country. ISIL videos, ISIL training videos are telling lone wolves the easiest way to buy a combat assault weapon in America is at a gun show.And it's because of the flip-flopping, political approach of Washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there for the last forty years.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~No, what I would say is this is look, I was the first of the three of us to call for America to accept the 65,000 refugees we were asked to accept. And if this humanitarian crisis increases, we should accept more.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Oh. All right.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with a ban on combat assault weapons, David.And, look, there are profound differences  [applause]Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill. Senator Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers. And Senator Sanders voted against even research dollars to look into this public health issue.Secretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don't need federal standards.Look, what we need on this issue is not more polls. We need more principle. When ISIL does training videos that say the easiest way to get a combat assault weapon in the United States of America is at a gun show, then we should all be waking up. We need comprehensive gun safety legislation and a ban on assault weapons.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~So David, the conclusion of all of those things is this; they weren't hopes, they weren't dreams, they weren't amorphous goals out there. We actually took action to do these things and as president, I have put forward 15 strategic goals that will make wages go up again for all American families. Universal national service is an option for every kid in America to cut youth employment.And I'm the only candidate on this stage to put forward a new agenda for America's cities so we can employ more people in the heart of great American cities and get them back to work.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Thank you.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~There is no issue in American public policy that I have worked on more day in and day out than this painful issue of policing, of law enforcement, criminal justice and race in America.When I ran in 1999, David, for mayor of Baltimore, our city by that year had become the most addicted, violent, and abandoned in America. But we came together. I brought people together over some very deep racial divides. And we were able to put our city on the path for the biggest reduction in crime of any major city in America over the next ten years.As governor, we continued to work together. We reduced violent crime to 30-year lows. But get this. We also reduced incarceration rates to 20-year lows. So it is possible actually, to find the things that actually work, that we did, increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half, and it's also possible to improve how we police our police.But there wasn't a single day as mayor of Baltimore that I wasn't asked whether I was delivering on the promise I made to police the police. We reported excessive force, discourtesy, use of lethal force. In fact, drove down to three of the four lowest years on record police use of lethal force.As a nation, we have to embrace this moment and make our departments more open, more transparent, and more accountable. Just as we require every major department, every county to report its major crimes, we should require police departments to report their discourtesy, brutality, excessive force.There's so much work that can be done, so much we've learned to do better. We need to do it now as a nation. This is our time and our opportunity to do that.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Well, that would be totally up to her. I mean, Katie has never been a person who let her husband's professional choices get in the way of following her dreams.And I think she got that from her mother, actually. [applause]The -- and I readily admit that she is a far more accomplished lawyer than I was ever able to become, before I took my detour. She is a district court judge in Maryland. She puts in a full day there. We've raised four terrific kids. And yet, when she was first lady of the state, not only would she go to work every day and sit there through a lot of sad and gut-wrenching cases, but then she'd put in additional time being an advocate against domestic violence.Maryland made great strides on that because of her advocacy, and her understanding of how the court process works. She was an advocate against bullying and implementing anti-bullying things. So Katie O'Malley will do whatever Katie O'Malley wants to do, regardless of her husband's success in getting elected president. [applause]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Well, we have invested nowhere near what we should be investing in human intelligence on the ground. And what I'm talking about is not only the covert CIA intelligence; I'm also talking about diplomatic intelligence. I mean, we've seen time and time again, especially in this very troubled region of nation-state failures, and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward.So what I would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms, but we do our military a disservice when we don't greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly, the role of sustainable development in all of this. As president, I would make the administrator of USAID an actual cabinet member. We have to act in a much more whole of government approach, as General Dempsey said.And I do believe, and I would disagree somewhat with one of my colleagues, this is a genocidal threat. They have now created a safe haven in the vacuum that we allowed to be partly and because of our blunders, to be created to be created in the areas of Syria and Iraq. We cannot allow safe havens, and as a leader of moral nations around this Earth, we need to come up with new alliances and new ways to prepare for these new sorts of threats, because Martha, this will not be the last region where nation-states fail.And you've seen a little bit of this emerging in the -- in the African Union and the things that they have done to better stabilize Somalia. We need to pay attention here in Central America as well. So this is the new type of threats that we're facing and we need to lead as a nation in confronting it and putting together new alliances and new coalitions.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~What these Chaldean families told me was that their families in Syria, when ISIS moves into their town, they actually paint a red cross across the door and mark their homes for demolition, and that tells the family you'd better get out now. The sort of genocide and brutality that the victims are suffering, these are not the perpetrators.We need to be the nation whose enduring symbol is the Statue of Liberty, and we need to act like the great country we are, according to our values.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~When you come back to me, I'll share that story.
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Yeah, David, look, for crying out loud, our country has been attacked, we have pressing issues involving how we're going to adapt to this changing era of warfare.Our economy -- people are working harder and being left behind. You want to know why things don't get done in Washington? Because for the last 24 hours, with those issues being so urgent to people as they tune in tonight, wondering how they're even be able to buy presents for their kids.Instead, we're listening to the bickering back and forth. Maybe that is normal politics in Washington, but that is not the politics of higher purpose that people expect from our party.We need to address our security issues, we need to address the economic issues around the kitchen table. And if people want a more high-minded politics and want to move our country forward, go on to martinomalley.com and help my campaign move our country forward. [applause]
Martin O'Malley~Democratic Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~December 19, 2015~Yes, this one falls under the category of, I have actually done this. As a governor we actually made the greater investments so that we could go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.My plan actually goes further than Senator Sanders because a big chunk of the cost is actually room and board and books and fees. So as a nation we need to increase what we invest in Pell grants. Yes, we need to make it easier for parents to refinance.But states need to do more as well. And I propose a block grant program that will keep the states in the game as well. I believe that all of our kids should go into an income-based repayment plan.I'm joined tonight by two daughters, Tara and Grace. My oldest daughter's a teacher. Um, and their mother's here as well. We were proud of them on graduation day, weren't we, Katie? And we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our lives.I mean, we had to borrow so much money to send them to college and were not the only ones. There're families all across America who aren't able to contribute to our economy because of this crushing student loan. I also propose that we can pay for this with a tax on high volume trades and we need to because my dad came to college after World War II on a G.I. Bill.But today, we're the only nation on the planet that's saddling our kids with a lifetime of bills. That's a drag on the economy. It's one of the key investments we need to make. I was flattered that Secretary Clinton two months later borrowed so many of my proposals to incorporate into hers. And in our party, unlike the Republican party, we actually believe that the more our people learn, the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~[inaudible] have as much time as she just had.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~a little bit of time here please? African-American kids are unemployed or underemployed to the tune of 51 percent. That's why I co-sponsored legislation to put $5 billion into a jobs program to put our kids to work because I would rather invest in education and jobs than jails and incarceration. [applause]We have got to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The United States has got to join the rest of the industrialized world in guaranteeing health care to all people as a right. [applause]We need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. And when we do that, under my plan, we create 13 million decent-paying jobs.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Absolutely.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Absolutely. They can go &mdash; I don't think they will, but Donald Trump's kids &mdash; Donald Trump's kids can go to public school right now, I think Secretary Clinton is talking about making community colleges free, they can go to those things.The point is we are going to get to Donald Trump by raising the taxes on the top 1 percent and our millionaires and billionaires. But all of our people, in my view, regardless of income, should have a right to get a higher education. I want children in the third grade to know that if they study hard, no matter what the income of their families, my family didn't have any income, my parents didn't go to college, they didn't have good income. I want every kid to know if you do your school work, study hard, yes, you will be able to get a college education. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~All right. Let me respond to this. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~And I am very pleased &mdash; I am very pleased that I think in the last national poll that I saw, we were running 18 points ahead of Donald Trump. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~As the secretary said, well, she will do it if other people do it. I will do it. I didn't give any speeches, there is no transcript. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~both in Nicaragua and Cuba. Look, let's look at the facts here. Cuba is, of course, an authoritarian undemocratic country, and I hope very much as soon as possible it becomes a democratic country. But on the other hand [applause] on the other hands, it would be wrong not to state that in Cuba they have made some good advances in health care. They are sending doctors all over the world. They have made some progress in education. I think by restoring full diplomatic relations with Cuba, it will result in significant improvements to the lives of Cubans and it will help the United States and our business community invest.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~But maybe some of these vulture capitalists who are going to have to lose a little bit of money in this process.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Did you ask me to speak?
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~former senators said, no, this wasn't the automobile bailout. It was the bailout of Wall Street.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~I'm on the committee, I know a little bit about this, I'm on the committee, Health, Education, Labor Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act. And it has done a number of good things. But when Secretary Clinton says, well, 90 percent of the people have insurance, yes, not really.Many of you may have insurance, but you have outrageously high deductibles and co-payments. One out of five Americans cannot afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe. Elderly people are cutting their pills in half.I do believe that we should do what every other major country on earth does, and I think when the American people stand up and fight back, yes, we can have it, a Medicare for all health care system. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~I'm sorry. Please say that
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~I'm sorry?
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~I can make that promise. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~I have introduced
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~I think the secretary and I mostly, I think, agree on this issue. Look, in this country, immigration reform is a very hot debate. It's divided the country. But I would hope very much, that as we have that debate, we do not, as Donald Trump and others have done, resort to racism and xenophobia and bigotry. [applause]This idea of suddenly, one day or maybe a night, rounding up 11 million people and taking them outside of this country is a vulgar, absurd idea that I would hope very few people in America support.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~I think what Secretary Clinton just said is absolutely right. I think I said it many months before she said it, but thanks for copying a very good idea. [applause]Now the question though, you know, I have been criticized a lot for thinking big. You know, that's for believing that we can do great things as a nation. One of the things we should not be doing obviously, is punishing people for doing what we want them to do and that is to get an education. [applause]But here is the point. My program, making public colleges and universities tuition free, allowing people with debt to refinance at the lowest possible interest rates is a fairly expensive proposal, about $70 billion a year.You know how I'm going to pay for it? I'm going to pay for it by imposing a tax on Wall Street speculation. [applause]We bailed out &mdash; Secretary Clinton was one of those who voted to bail out Wall Street. Now I think it's time for Wall Street to help the working families of this country.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~I want you all to think. What Secretary Clinton is saying is that the United States should continue to be the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all of our people. [applause]I think if the rest of the world can do it, we can. And by the way, not only are we being ripped off by the drug companies, we are spending far, far more per capita on health care than any other major country on earth.You may not think the American people are prepared to stand up to the insurance companies or the drug companies. I think they are. And I think we can pass
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~I would think that a speech so great that you got paid so much money for, you would like to share it with the American people. So I think she should release the transcript. [laughter and applause][crosstalk]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~It's
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~It is corporate welfare and yes, I oppose corporate welfare. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Let me &mdash; let's &mdash; so that everybody knows, the bill that Secretary Clinton is talking about, that is &mdash; that was the bailout of the recklessness, irresponsibility and illegal behavior of Wall Street. It was the Wall Street bailout. [applause]And I find it interesting that when Secretary Clinton, who was the former senator of New York, of course, when she defended her vote, she said, well, it's going to help the big banks in New York. Those are my constituents. And then you go to Detroit and suddenly this legislation helps the automobile workers. There was an article just yesterday
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Let me be very clear [crosstalk]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Let me just answer, I want to get back to this 2007 immigration bill. It's true, Ted Kennedy, a good friend of mine, and I think of the secretary's, did work very hard on that bill. But does anyone really believe that if that bill was all so good, as the secretary is touting, that LULAC and other major Latino organizations, the largest Latino organizations in this country said no to that bill.And I worked very hard in improving the guest worker provisions so that in 2013 a bill I strongly supported, people who were in the guest worker program in America would not be treated like slaves. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Let me just say
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Let me just say this. I don't think that the secretary fully answered your question, and I think the proof may be in the pudding. Honduras and that region of the world may be the most violent region in our hemisphere. Gang lords, vicious people torturing people, doing horrible things to families. Children fled that part of the world to try, try, try, try, maybe, to meet up with their family members in this country, taking a route that was horrific, trying to start a new life.Secretary Clinton did not support those children coming into this country. I did.Now I happen to agree with President Obama on many, many issues. I think he has done a great job as president of the United States. He is wrong on this issue of deportation. I disagree with him on that. [applause]So to answer your question, no, I will not deport children from the United States of America.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Let me respond &mdash; let me respond to that.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Let me respond.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Look, clearly, clearly, the secretary's words to Wall Street has really intimidated them, and that is why they have given her $15 million in campaign contributions.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Look, I understand that not everybody in Florida or in the United States will agree with me, but I think we have got to end the embargo. [applause]I believe that we should move towards full and normalized political relations with Cuba. I think at the end of the day, it will be a good thing for the Cuban people. It will enable them, I think when they see people coming into their country from the United States, move in a more democratic direction, which is what I want to see. So right &mdash; I'm sorry.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Madam Secretary, when he asked me to speak
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~No, I do not propose free college tuition, I proposed free tuition at public colleges and universities. Yes I did. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~No. What they would &mdash; look, this is what I believe, Jorge. This is the year 2016. Fifty years ago a high school degree got you a good job in the economy. Today, in many respects, a college degree is the equivalent of a high school degree.We have got to go beyond first grade to 12th grade when we talk about public education. [applause]So I do believe we should make public colleges and universities tuition-free, and I don't believe we should punish millions of young and not-so-young people with outrageous levels of student debt.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Now, let me say this. I gather Secretary Clinton hasn't listened to too many of my speeches. [laughter]Or followed my work in the Congress as very few people stood up to George W. Bush whether it was the war in Iraq or any other of his policies. [laughter]Now, when we talk about the policies of the 1990s, I worked closely and supported President Clinton. And obviously, I have worked very closely in supporting President Obama, who has taken our economy a very long way from where Bush left us. But when you go back to the 1990s, let's remember, that's when Wall Street deregulation took place.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Now, what I believe is in fact that we have a corrupt campaign finance system. And it's not just Wall Street, it's the drug companies, [inaudible] received millions of dollars from the fossil fuel industry. We've got to overturn Citizens United and end that. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Of course not. There was a piece of legislation supported by dozens and dozens of members of the House which codified existing legislation. What the secretary is doing tonight and has done very often is take large pieces of legislation and take pieces out of it.No, I did not oppose the bailout or the support of the automobile industry. No, I do not support vigilantes, and that is a horrific statement, an unfair statement to make. [applause]I will stand [inaudible] of my career, political career fighting for workers, fighting for the poorest people in this country. Madame Secretary, I will match my record against yours any day of the week. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Oh wait a minute. Can I have
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~OK, let me answer that question because it's a huge question. And one of the &mdash; huge, I know. [laughter]One of the points that I've been making, and media does not seem to pick up on it, is that we have a real crisis not only with real unemployment in America being close to 10 percent, but youth unemployment in this country.If you look at Latino kids between 17 and 20 who graduated high school, 36 percent of them are unemployed or underemployed
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Poverty is increasing. And if wages are going down, I don't know why we need millions of people to be coming into this country as guestworkers who will work for lower wages than American workers and drive wages down even lower than they are right now.[end video clip][crosstalk]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Sure.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Thank you &mdash; thank you all very much. I'm running for president of the United States because given the crises facing our country, it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.Together we're going to have to overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision. [applause]Billionaires and Wall Street should not be buying elections. We've got to end this rigged economy where people are working longer hours for low wages, almost all new income and wealth going to the top 1 percent, and of course, we need comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship.And here in Miami [applause] here in Miami as much as any city in America, we know that we have got to combat climate change, transform our energy system, and leave this planet in a way that is healthy and habitable for our kids and our grandchildren.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Thank you.Let's be clear. You're looking at the senator who introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation in the history of the United States Senate. [applause]Now, I hope that Secretary Clinton would join me if we are serious about climate change, about imposing a tax on carbon on the fossil fuel industry and making massive investments in energy efficiency and sustainable energy. And by the way, while we are on the subject of energy, I hope you'll join me in ending fracking in the United States of America. [applause][crosstalk]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~That's when disastrous trade policies took place.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~That is exactly what releasing the transcripts will tell us. This I do know. This I do know. There is a reason why Wall Street has provided $15 million just in the last reporting period to the secretary's super PAC.Now, the secretary says it doesn't influence her. Well, that's what every politician says who gets money from special interests. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~The Export/Import Bank is often called the bank of Boeing, because Boeing corporation gets 40 percent of the revenue.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~The key issue here was whether the United States should go around overthrowing small Latin American countries. I think that that was a mistake
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~The question that the American people have to determine - you know, can you say that Wall Street is greedy, they're fraudulent, but they're not dumb. Why are they making those kind of large contributions?
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~The way I would move forward in every other area. And what we are doing in this campaign is fighting not only to become president, but I'm the only candidate who says no president, not Bernie Sanders, can do it all. You know what we need, Karen? We need a political revolution in this country. [applause]And when millions of people stand up and tell the fossil fuel industry that their profits, their short-term profits are less significant than the long-term health of this planet, we will win. That is the way change always takes place. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~There is a process under way, and that process will take its course. Today in America, the middle class is disappearing. We have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, climate change threatens the whole planet, 47 million people live in poverty. I'm going to focus on the issues facing the working families of this country. That process specifically.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~There is nobody in the United States Congress who has taken on the Koch brothers, who want to destroy Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and virtually every federal program passed since the 1930s more that Bernie Sanders. [applause]And I am proud that the gentleman who is head of Goldman Sachs, now, he didn't give me $225,000 for speaking fees, he said I was dangerous and he's right. I am dangerous for Wall Street. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~This has been a wonderful debate, but time being limited, some of the most important issues facing our country have not been asked. And that is, is it acceptable that in America the top 0.1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. Is it acceptable that while the average American works longer hours for lower wages, 58 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent.Is it acceptable that Wall Street and billionaires are spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to buy elections? Is that democracy or this that oligarchy? Which is why I believe we've got to overturn Citizens United and move to public funding of elections.Is it right that in the greatest, wealthiest country in the history of the world, so many of our young people can't even afford to go to college or leave school deeply in debt, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world? If we stand up, fight back, we can do a lot better. That's why I'm running for president. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~This is what I think. I think that the American people are never going to elect a president who insults Mexicans, who insults Muslims, who insults women, who insults African-Americans. And let us not forget that several years ago, Trump was in the middle of the so- called birther movement, trying to delegitimize the president of the United States of America. [applause]You know, I find it very interesting, Karen, my dad was born in Poland. I know a little bit about the immigrant experience. Nobody has ever asked me for my birth certificate. Maybe it has something to do with the color of my skin. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Well, as I said earlier, I don't believe it is the business of the United States government to be overthrowing small countries around the world. And number two, when you get to Puerto Rico, there's an issue that we have not talked about. That little island is $73 billion in debt and the government now is paying interest rates of up to 11 percent.And many of the bonds that they are paying off were purchased by vulture capitalists for 30 cents on the dollar. And what I have said in talking to the leaders of Puerto Rico, we've got to bring people together. And it's not the people of Puerto Rico, or the children or the schools.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Well, first of all, Karen, when you have Republican candidates for president and in Congress telling you that climate change is a hoax, which is Donald Trump and other candidates' position, what they are really saying is, we don't have the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry. [applause]What candidates are saying is if we stand up to the fossil fuel industry, and transform our energy system away from coal and oil and gas to energy efficiency and wind and solar and geothermal and other sustainable technologies, you know what happens to that Republican who listens to the scientists? On that day, that Republican loses his campaign funding from the Koch brothers and the fossil fuel industry.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Well, I'm not going to comment on the Benghazi tragedy, but I will say this. A series of articles in the New York Times talked about Secretary Clinton's role in urging the administration to go forward with regime change, getting rid of Gadhafi in Libya.Gadhafi was a brutal dictator, there's no question. But one of the differences between the secretary and I is I'm not quite so aggressive with regard to regime change. I voted against the war in Iraq because I had a fear of what would happen the day after. [applause]And Secretary Clinton talks about Henry Kissinger
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Well, I absolutely support that. At the heart of my immigration policy and I should say that the New York times editorial board called my immigration policy the most progressive and the strongest of any candidate running.But to answer your question, the essence of what we are trying to do is to unite families, not to divide families. [applause]The idea that a mother is living here and her children are on the other side of the border is wrong and immoral. A number of months ago, I talked to a young man who was serving in the United States military and while he was serving in the military, his wife was deported.That is beyond comprehension and policies that should not be allowed to exist. So, ma'am, I will do everything that I can to unite your family. Your children deserve to be with their mother. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Well, let me just answer that. What that was about was saying that the United States was wrong to try to invade Cuba, that the United States was wrong trying to support people to overthrow the Nicaraguan government, that the United States was wrong trying to overthrow in 1954, the government &mdash; democratically elected government of Guatemala.Throughout the history of our relationship with Latin America we've operated under the so-called Monroe Doctrine, and that said the United States had the right do anything that they wanted to do in Latin America. So I actually went to Nicaragua and I very shortly opposed the Reagan administration's efforts to overthrow that government. And I strongly opposed earlier Henry Kissinger and the &mdash; to overthrow the government of Salvador Aliende in Chile.I think the United States should be working with governments around the world, not get involved in regime change. And all of these actions, by the way, in Latin America, brought forth a lot of very strong anti-American sentiments. That's what that was about.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Well, we do the best &mdash; we don't know. And I should also say with regard to that 2007 immigration bill, as you may know, LULAC, the major Hispanic organization in his country, also opposed that bill as did many other Latino organizations.But to your point, we have to do the best we can. I applaud President Obama for his efforts on DAPA and DACA. And I think we have got to expand those efforts.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Well, what I have said is that when you get I believe it is $225,000 for giving a speech, and she gave several speeches to Goldman Sachs, one of the Wall Street financial institutions whose greed and illegal behavior helped destroy our economy a number of years ago, when you get paid $225,000, that means that that speech must have been an extraordinarily wonderful speech. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Well, when we talk about efforts to assist immigrants, Secretary Clinton prevailed upon the governor of New York, Elliot Spitzer, who wanted to do the right thing and provide driver's license to these who were undocumented, she said don't do it, and New York State still does not do it. In Vermont, by the way, I worked with officials and undocumented people in Vermont do have the ability to get driver's license. [applause]When we talk about immigration, the secretary will remember that one of the great tragedies, human tragedies of recent years is children came from Honduras where there's probably more violence than almost any place in this country, and they came into this country. And I said welcome those children into this country, Secretary Clinton said send them back. That's a difference.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Well, you've got to look at what the career is about. And this is a career that has stood up to every special interest in this country. I don't take money from Wall Street. I demand that we break up the large financial institutions.I don't take money from the pharmaceutical industry because I believe they are ripping off the American people and charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. [applause]I don't take money from the fossil fuel industry because they are destroying &mdash; they are destroying this planet through their emissions of carbon and creating the terrible climate change that we are seeing.So I think it is true that I have served in Congress for many years. But if you check my record, it is a record of strength for the environment, for workers, for seniors. Unlike the secretary, I believe we should expand Social Security benefits. It is a record of achievement for veterans, working with Republicans, helping to craft the most significant veterans healthcare bill passed in many decades.So I think the point is look at the record, and it's a record that I am proud of. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Well, you have guestworker programs that have been described by the Southern Poverty Law Center, one of the important institutions in this country who studies these issues, as guestworkers programs akin to slavery, where people came in. They were cheated. They were abused. They were humiliated. And if they stood up for their rights, they would be thrown out of the country.Of course, that type of [inaudible] leads to a race to the bottom for all of our people. And I worked very hard on that issue. And of course, I supported the 2013 immigration reform bill. And what I believe right now is not only that we need comprehensive immigration reform, if the Congress does not do its job, as president of the United States I will use the executive powers of that office to do what has to be done, to do what President Obama did, and expand on that.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Well, you know, when we began this campaign, I was 3% in the polls. I was probably 60 or 70 points behind the Secretary. We have come a long way in 10 months. We have won [applause] including Michigan last night, which some people,considered one of the major political upsets in modern American history. We have won nine state primaries and caucuses. And I believe that our message of the need for people to stand up and tell corporate America and Wall Street that they cannot have it all is resonating across this country.And I think in the coming weeks and months, we are going to continue to do extremely well, win a number of these primaries, and convince superdelegates that Bernie Sanders is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~where people like Senator Bayh and Ron Wyden, Byron Dorgan
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~winning the praise of Henry Kissinger, I don't want Henry Kissinger's praise at all. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Yeah, let me
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Yes, good things happened, but some dangerous mistakes were made that laid the groundwork for some of the problems we're having with a disappearing middle class today.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~You know, Ted Kennedy was a very close friend of mine, and I served on the committee he chaired, the Health, Education, Labor Committee. And Ted Kennedy was kind enough to allow me to hold a hearing in 2008, I believe, in Congress, dealing with the plight of undocumented tomato pickers in Immokalee, Florida. [applause]And I went there on my own. Wasn't an issue really for the state of Vermont to expose the horrendous working conditions and the semi slavery, if you like, that those workers lived under. And the result of that hearing and the work that many, many people did was to significantly improve the wages and working conditions of those workers. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~You may recall way back in, when was it, 1961, they invaded Cuba, and everybody was totally convinced that Castro was the worst guy in the world. All the Cuban people were going to rise up in rebellion against Fidel Castro. They forgot that he educated their kids, gave them health care, totally transformed their society.[end video clip]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Absolutely, although it happens before I am president if I am so fortunate to be. I have been calling for months that the Congress must give authority to Puerto Rico to restructure its debts. [applause]Just like it has enabled states and cities to restructure their debt. And it's a grave injustice for the Congress, led by the Republicans to be refusing to enact that opportunity within the bankruptcy law.And what we see in Puerto Rico now is a lot of suffering. We see schools being closed, we see health care being denied and we see a thousand Puerto Rican families a month moving to the United States, mostly to Florida.Puerto Ricans are citizen of America. [applause]They deserve to be treated as citizens and to be given the opportunity to get back on their feet economically. And I just want to add one thing to the question you were asking Senator Sanders. I think in that same interview, he praised what he called the revolution of values in Cuba and talked about how people were working for the common good, not for themselves.I just couldn't disagree more. You know, if the values are that you oppress people, you disappear people, you imprison people or even kill people for expressing their opinions, for expressing freedom of speech, that is not the kind of revolution of values that I ever want to see anywhere. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~After all, there are [applause][crosstalk]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~And I of course sympathize with members of the families who are still, you know, very much grieving.And I wish that there could be an easy answer at the time, but we learned a lot, and the intelligence kept
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~And so thank you for having us, and I look forward to the debate. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~and stood with the Minutemen vigilantes in their ridiculous, absurd efforts to, quote, "hunt down immigrants.So look, I think the goal here is to elect a Democratic Senate, elect a Democratic president and get to work immediately to get comprehensive immigration reform. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~And we deserve answers about how these programs will actually work and how they would be paid for.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Because &mdash; because after all &mdash; excuse me.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Everything I just said will improve the living conditions, and I've spent a lot of time and effort talking to and mostly listening to Latinos. Jobs are the number one issue, with rising incomes. Close behind is education.Every child deserves a good teacher in a good school, regardless of the zip code that they live in. Following behind that is health care and how important it is to continue to build on the Affordable Care Act and provide access to health care. And then there are a number of other issues &mdash; comprehensive immigration reform certainly at the top.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Excuse me, excuse me.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~First of all, please know how brave I think you are, coming here with your children to tell your story. This is an incredible act of courage that I'm not sure many people really understand. And I want you to know that in the work that I've done and the many families that I've met, I have heard similar stories like yours, where your husband is deported. Your children's father is gone.You are doing your very best to support your children. But it is time to bring families together. And I don't think there's any doubt that we must do more to let stories like yours be heard more widely so that more Americans know what the human cost of these policies are.And I will do everything I can to prevent other families from facing what you are facing. And I will do everything I can to pass laws that would bring families back together. And I hope that your children are all either citizens born in this country or eligible for the programs that President Obama has put into place, DACA and DAPA, because I will defend those and I will absolutely protect your children, yourself, and try to bring your family back together. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Great. Thank you.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Here's what I can promise Jorge, I can promise that I will do everything possible to provide due process.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~I am not concerned about it. I am not worried about it and no Democrat or American should be either. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~I called for those changes. I have been on the record and now I do have the toughest, most comprehensive plan to go after Wall Street. And not just the big banks, all the other financial interests that pose a threat to our economy. And I have said no bank is too big to fail and no executive is too powerful to jail, and I will use the powers that have now been passed by the Congress, by President Obama, who, incidentally, took a lot of money from Wall Street, which didn't stop him from signing into law the toughest regulations on the financial industry since the Great Depression. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~I think it's un-American. I think what he has promoted is not at all in keeping with American values, Karen. And I am going to take every opportunity to criticize him, to raise those issues.I'm not going to engage in the kind of language that he uses. I think we can make the case against him if he is the nominee, by pointing out what he has said. What he claims to believe in The values he's promoting and I think that's a better way for the American people to draw their conclusions.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~I will not deport children. I would not deport children. I do not want to deport family members either, Jorge. I want to, as I said, prioritize who would be deported: violent criminals, people planning terrorist attacks, anybody who threatens us. That's a relatively small universe.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~I will not.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~I would stop
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~If I could [applause] You know, I think it's very hard to make the case that Ted Kennedy, Barack Obama, me, La Raza, United Farmworkers, Dolores Huerta, leaders of the Latino community, would have supported a bill that actually promoted modern slavery. That was one of the many excuses used not to vote for the 2007 bill.And I will go back to what I said. If we had been able to get that passed, we would be so much further along now. I'm committed to defending DAPA and DACA. I'm committed to going even further to get more people deferred action, to go as far as I can under the law. And I am committed to introducing comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship in the first 100 days of my presidency.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~improving, and we learned enough to say what we think happened at Benghazi.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~In 2003, I sponsored the DREAMER Act. I sponsored I think in every Congress after that. I have been consistent and committed to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.I think our best chance was in 2007, when Ted Kennedy led the charge on comprehensive immigration reform. We have Republican support. We had a president willing to sign it. I voted for that bill. Senator Sanders voted against it.Just think, imagine where we would be today is we had achieved comprehensive immigration reform nine years ago. Imagine how much more secure families would be in our country, no longer fearing the deportation of a loved one; no longer fearing that they would be found out.So I am staunchly in favor of comprehensive immigration reform and have been so over the course of my public career. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~It's a big difference. First of all, as I understand him, he's talking about a very tall wall. [laughter]Right? A beautiful tall wall. The most beautiful tall wall, better than the Great Wall of China, that would run the entire border. That he would somehow magically get the Mexican government to pay for. And, you know, it's just fantasy. And in fact, if he cared to know anything about what members of Congress, like the senator and I have done, where it was necessary, we did support some fencing.Where it was necessary, we did add border patrol agents. We have done what by any fair estimate would have to conclude is a good job, quote, "securing the border". So let's get about the business of comprehensive immigration reform.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~It was a very close race. We've had some of those. I've won some. I've lost some. But, you know, I was very pleased by the overall outcome last night. And now we're on to the states for next Tuesday and I'm looking forward to campaigning hard in all of them.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Jorge, that makes my point. At the time I e-mailed with my daughter, a terrorist group had taken credit for the attacks on our facility in Benghazi. Within 16, 18 hours, they rescinded taking credit. They did it all on social media. And the video did play a role.We have captured one of the lead terrorists and he admits it was both a terrorist attack and it was influenced by the video. This was fog of war. This was complicated. The most effective, comprehensive reports and studies demonstrate that.Look, as I said in the beginning, I deeply regret that we lost four Americans.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Karen, I'm going to follow my friend Senator Sanders model here. If I'm so fortunate enough to be the Democratic nominee, there will be a lot of time to talk about him. I was the first one to call him out. I called him out when he was calling Mexicans rapists.When he was engaging in rhetoric that I found deeply offensive. I said basta, and I am pleased that others [applause] others are also joining in making clear that his rhetoric, his demagoguery, his trafficking in prejudice and paranoia has no place in our political system. Especially from somebody running for president who couldn't decide whether or not to disavow the Ku Klux Klan and David Duke. So people can draw their own conclusions about him. I will just end by saying this. You don't make America great by getting rid of everything that made America great. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Let's talk about the auto bailout because I think it's important for people to understand what happened. In December of 2008, we were both in the Senate, there was a vote on a free-standing bill to rescue the auto industry. We both voted for it. was the right vote. Unfortunately, it did not succeed. The Republicans marshalled the votes against it.A month later, in January, a new piece of legislation was offered that contained the money that would be used for the auto rescue. Then President-elect Obama &mdash; before he'd even been sworn in &mdash; sent word to all of us that he really hoped we would support it. He was still in the Senate, I was still in the Senate.And I voted for it. It was a hard vote. I'll tell you, it was a hard vote. A lot of the votes you make are hard votes. But the fact is the money that rescued the auto industry was in that bill.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Let me &mdash; let me respond again because the misrepresentation can't go unanswered here.First of all, that is something that is not fair about what I said. I did say we needed to be very concerned about little children coming to this country &mdash; on their own, very often &mdash; many of them not making it. And when they got here, they needed, as I have argued for, legal counsel, due process, to make a decision. We need to end private detention, we need to end family detention.And in 2006, when Senator Sanders was running for the Senate from Vermont, he voted in the House with hard-line Republicans for indefinite detention for undocumented immigrants, and then he sided with those Republicans to stand with vigilantes known as Minute Men who were taking up outposts along the border to hunt down immigrants.So I think when you were running for the Senate, you made it clear by your vote, Senator, that you were going to stand with the Republicans. When you got to the Senate in 2007, one of the first things you did was vote against Ted Kennedy's immigration reform which he'd been working on for years before you ever arrived.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Let me just conclude by saying that United Farm Workers considered that bill in their words the last best hope for farm workers and immigrants.They have proven to be right in the succeeding years. I only hope that we can put together a coalition to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the next Congress. And as I said earlier, in 2006, Senator Sanders supported indefinite detention for people facing deportation
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Let me say this. I would give every person, but particularly children, due process to have their story told. And a lot of children will, of course, have very legitimate stories under our law to be able to stay.[end video clip]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Now, Senator Sanders voted against it. That's his perfect right to vote against it. But if everyone had voted as he voted
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Of the people, the undocumented people living in our country, I do not want to see them deported. I want to see them on a path to citizenship. That is exactly what I will do. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Oh, for goodness &mdash; that's not going to happen. I'm not even answering that question. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Thank you very much. I've been looking forward to this debate, and I want to thank Univision, the Washington Post, Facebook and Miami-Dade College, the largest college in North America for hosting us here this evening. [applause]And tonight I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how we knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying ahead, starting with the economic ones. My focus is on more good paying jobs with rising incomes for families and how we prevent corporations from taking jobs out of our country by imposing an exit tax, making them pay back any tax breaks they've gotten.But we also need to be having a positive agenda for manufacturing. for small businesses and entrepreneurs, for more clean energy jobs. And I also look forward to discussing comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship that will be one of my priorities in my first 100 days as president. And I will also be talking about education, every child deserves a good teacher and a good school.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~That's what I'm telling you. Now I don't want &mdash; because I'm not contradicting what I told you in the interview. Asylum is a particular legal process. I'd like to see it changed. I'd like to see us give more support to people who come fleeing the terrible violence that they do. But under our law, we have a process we have to go through which is different.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~That will help Latinos as well as every other working person in our country. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~There was no permission to be asked. It had been done by my predecessors. It was permitted.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~This is a very important point in this debate, because I do believe in universal coverage. Remember, I fought for it 25 years ago. I believe in it. And I know that thanks the Affordable Care Act, we are now 90 percent of universal coverage. I will build on the Affordable Care Act. I will take it further. I will reduce the cost.But I just respectfully disagree. Between the Republicans trying to repeal the first chance we've ever had to get to universal health care, and Senator Sanders wanting to throw us into a contentious debate over single-payer, I think the smart approach is build on and protect the Affordable Care Act. Make it work. Reduce the cost. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~This is why I go back to that 2007 vote because if we had been successful then, a lot of the issues we are still discussing today would be in the rear-view mirror. I want us to be able to achieve comprehensive immigration reform if I'm so fortunate enough to be president. And we do have to take a look at asylum laws.When I was secretary of state, I worked to try to support many different approaches to ending the violence in Central America. I was there meeting with leaders, security leaders, and others. And I think the Congress should support the president's request to fund programs that would protect people and change the culture of criminality and violence in Central America, helping people be able to stay safely in their homes and countries. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Wait a minute. I just think it's worth pointing out that the leaders of the fossil fuel industry, the Koch brothers, have just paid to put up an ad praising Senator Sanders. There are a lot of different powerful interests in Washington. I've taken them on. I took on the drug companies. I took on the insurance companies. Before there was something called Obamacare, there was something called Hillarycare, and I worked really hard [applause] to get comprehensive health care reform, and they beat me. So I have a long record of standing up to special interests. And I will continue to do so.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~we would not have rescued the auto industry.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Well, congratulations on your education. And also on your plans for the future. And here's what I will do. We're going to refinance everyone's existing student debt, 40 million Americans have student debt. [applause]And right now, I go around asking people at my events if they know what their interest rate is and the interest rates literally go from like 8 percent to 14 percent. It's outrageous that at a time when interest rates have been historically low, people borrowing money to invest in their education are paying some of the highest interest rates around.And you can refinance your house to get a lower interest rate. You can refinance your car. Corporations can refinance their debt. Under my plan, you will be able to also lower your debt, move into a program to pay it back as a percentage of your income and more than that, my plan for debt-free tuition at public colleges and universities will eventually eliminate any student debt.But for people who have it, I'm going to put a date certain that after a certain number of years, you no longer have to pay anything. The government has to quit making money off of lending money to young people to get their education. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Well, first Karen, obviously it's painful for me to hear that. And I do take responsibility. When you're in public life, even if you believe that it's not an opinion that you think is fair or founded, you do have to take responsibility. And I do.And I also have, you know, very much committed to the best of my ability my energies and efforts to helping people. That's something that I care deeply about. And I will continue to do that, to demonstrate by my past actions and my present levels of commitment and plans that people can count on me.That is certainly what happened to me in New York, where people got to know me. They saw me in action. And they did.Look, I have said before and it won't surprise anybody to hear me say it, this is not easy for me. It's not easy to do what I think is right, to help people, to even the odds, to hear a story like the woman's story we just heard. And to know that I can make a difference and I want to in every way possible.I am not a natural politician, in case you haven't noticed, like my husband or President Obama. So I have a view that I just have to do the best I can, get the results I can, make a difference in people's lives, and hope that people see that I'm fighting for them and that I can improve conditions economically and other ways that will benefit them and their families.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Well, first of all, I supported the president's moves. I helped to implement some of them leading up to the announcements when I was secretary of state, expanding travel opportunities, remittances. And I certainly told the president toward the end of my time that I hoped he would be able to move toward diplomatic relations and to make more of an impact by building up the relationship. And there are no better ambassadors for freedom, democracy and economic opportunity than Cuban Americans.So the more that we can have that kind of movement back and forth, the more likely we are to be able to move Cuba toward greater freedom, greater respect for rights.You know, I'm looking forward to following the president's trip. I do think meeting with dissidents, meeting with people who have been voices, tribunes of freedom and opportunity is important.The Cuban people deserve to have their human rights respected and upheld, they deserve to be able to move towards democracy where they pick their own leads. And I think both Castros have to be considered authoritarian and dictatorial because they are not freely chosen by the people that are in Cuba. [applause]I hope someday there will be leaders who are chosen by the Cuban people, and I hope that democracy will be deeply rooted in Cuban soil and that the people of Cuba will have every opportunity to fulfill their own dreams in their own country. That is my hope.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Well, I'm going to respond to that, because I think it's a very important issue. And by the way, everybody, who, quote, "got money" in the quote, "bailout", that also included money for the auto rescue has paid it back.So, the Treasury was out nothing. Now that will no longer happen because we have Dodd-Frank and we will break up banks that pose a systemic threat to our economy. [applause]But let me say this. Senator Sanders has talked about free college for everybody. He's talked about universal, single payer health care for everybody. And yet, when you ask questions, as many of us have and more importantly, independent experts, it's very hard to get answers.And a lot of the answers say that this is going to be much more expensive than anything Senator Sanders is admitting to. This is going to increase the federal government dramatically. And, you know, my dad used to say, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Well, I certainly know what all Americans need, and that is more jobs, with rising incomes. It's something that I have worked on for many years. It's why I've laid down the only really comprehensive plan about how to create more good jobs.And there are several things that need to be addressed. We do have to do more infrastructure spending. That will put many Americans to work. It's a good job that gets you on the ladder to the middle class. We need to improve the conditions for manufacturing in our country and punish those companies that want to export jobs. We need them to be incentivized to create jobs right here in America.We also do have to combat climate change, and no state has more at stake in that than Florida. And the best way to do that is not only enforcing the laws we have, but also the clean power plan that President Obama has put forth that I support, and the Paris agreement that I think was a huge step forward in the world, that Senator Sanders said was too weak, but I helped to lay the groundwork for that.But we need more clean energy jobs and we have to do more to help small businesses. You know, the fastest-growing segment of small businesses are minority and women-owned small business, and we need to help businesses get started.The very distinguished congresswoman from New York who's been on the Small Business Committee, Congresswoman Velasquez, knows exactly what we need to be doing to create more small businesses. We do need to raise the minimum wage and we have to guarantee equal pay for women.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Well, I think both of us, both Senator Sanders and I, voted numerous times to enhance border security along our border. We increased the number of border security agents. We did vote for money to build a fence, a pedestrian fence in some place, a vehicle fence in other places. And the result is that we have the most secure border we've ever had.Apprehensions coming across the border are the lowest they've been in 40 years, which just strengthens my argument that now it's time to do comprehensive immigration reform. The Republicans, the opponents no longer have an argument. And certainly, we hear a lot coming from the Republican side that is absolutely out of touch with reality. We raised money through the congressional appropriations process. We enhanced the border security. That part of the work is done.Everybody that I know has looked at it said, okay, we have a secure border. There's no need for this rhetoric and demagoguery that's still &mdash;is carried out on the Republican side. You've run out of excuses. Let's move to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. And I think that makes a very strong argument in favor of doing it.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Well, I think this is one of the most important issues facing our country right now. And I fully support President Obama's intention under the constitution to nominate a successor to Justice Scalia. And I believe [applause] I believe no state probably understands this better than Florida. Because let's remember three words: Bush versus Gore. [applause]A court took away a presidency. Now we've got the Republican Congress trying to take away the constitution. And we should not tolerate that. [applause]And so from my perspective, it is imperative that we put enormous pressure on the Republicans in the Senate to do their constitutional duty. Now, obviously you look for people who are not only qualified on paper, but have a heart, have life experience, understand what these decisions mean in the lives of Americans.And understand the balance of power that their decisions can disrupt one way or the other. So clearly, I would look for people who believe that Roe v. Wade is settled law and that Citizens United needs to be overturned as quickly as possible. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Well, if I can say
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Well, Jorge, there's a lot of questions in there. And I'm going to give the same answer I've been giving for many months. It wasn't the best choice. I made a mistake. It was not prohibited. It was not in any way disallowed. And as I have said and as now has come out, my predecessors did the same thing and many other people in the government. But here's the cut to the chase facts. I did not send or receive any emails marked classified at the time. What you are talking about is retroactive classification. And the reason that happens is when somebody asks or when you are asked to make information public, I asked all my emails to be made public. Then all the rest of the government gets to weigh in.And some other parts of the government, we're not exactly sure who, has concluded that some of the emails should be now retroactively classified. They've just said the same thing to former Secretary Colin Powell. They have said, we're going to retroactively classify emails you sent personally. Now I think he was right when he said this is an absurdity. And I think that what we have got here is a case of overclassification.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Well, Karen, first of all, I was proud a number of mayors from Florida campaign for me in South Carolina. I had a chance to talk to some of them about this issue. It is a really serious one. And there isn't much time left to do several things that I will move quickly to do.You can see already what's happening in Miami, particularly in Miami Beach with tides rising. So we do have to invest in resilience and mitigation while we are trying to cut emissions and make up for the fact that this is clearly man-made and man-aggravated. And there are certain things that the president has done through executive action that I will absolutely support. All the Republican say they will, if they're elected, heaven forbid, repeal all of those executive actions. I will maintain them and act on them.The clean power plan is something that Senator Sanders has said he would delay implementing, which makes absolutely no sense. We need to implement all of the president's executive actions and quickly move to make a bridge from coal to natural gas to clean energy.That is the way we will keep the lights on while we are transitioning to a clean energy future. And when I talk about resilience, I think that is an area we can get Republican support on.[crosstalk]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Well, Karen, I do agree that we have to end the revolving door. I strongly support a piece of legislation from Senator Tammy Baldwin that would do just that. And I will be looking for people who will put the interests of consumers first, who will do more to try to make sure Main Street flourishes. And I will very much reach out and ask for advice as to who should be appointed, including to Senator Warren and many of my other former colleagues in the Senate.But I think it's important also to look at what we want to accomplish. You know, in the debates we've had &mdash; maybe this is the seventh or so &mdash; Senator Sanders is always criticizing the two recent Democratic presidents &mdash; President Clinton and President Obama. And that's fine, but I wish he would criticize and join me in criticizing George W. Bush, who I think wrecked the economy and created the conditions for the great recession. You know, at the end of the '90s, we had 23 million new jobs. Incomes went up for everybody. We were talking earlier about what needs to be done for Latinos and African Americans. Well, we were doing it by the end of the '90s. Median family income went up 17 percent. For minorities, it went up even more.Along came the Republicans, trickle-down economics &mdash; one of the worst ideas since snake oil &mdash; was put back into place. And we ended up with the great recession. President Obama had to rescue the economy. And I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for doing that.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Well, let's do that. Let's talk about that. Let's talk about that.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Well, let me respond, as I have numerous times during this campaign. You know, I have a public record and you can go look it up. I went to Wall Street before the Great Recession and basically called them out, said that their behavior was putting our economy at risk, called for a moratorium on foreclosures.I went to the Orlando area during the '08 campaign to make the same case, visiting with families who had been defrauded by mortgages, these subprime mortgages that put them and their homes at risk.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Well, look, I won one of the contests and lost another close one. I am continuing to work hard for every single vote across our country. I was pleased that I got 100,000 more votes last night than my opponent and more delegates.So this is a marathon, and it's a marathon that can only be carried out by the kind of inclusive campaign that I'm running, a campaign that reaches out to everybody, a campaign that offers real positive solutions to the problems that we face, a campaign that is based on how together we can make progress, because I am a progressive who likes to get things done.So I'm excited about the upcoming contests, including right here in Florida. And we'll continue to work as hard as I can to earn the vote of every single voter.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Well, thank you very much for a lively debate. And I appreciate greatly all the questions, especially the questions in person from the people here and those coming at us from Facebook. It just reinforces my strong commitment to do everything I can to break down all the barriers that stand in the way of people living up to their own potential, and of our country doing the same.So I am going to take on those economic barriers. I have a plan to create jobs and raise incomes. I'm going to take on the education barriers that often leave too many children behind even after they have completed schooling. I'm going to take on the healthcare barriers.I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that we unite our country. I will find common ground, just as I have as first lady, as senator and secretary of state. I will also stand my ground wherever matters of principles are at stake. I would be honored to have your support in the upcoming primary on Tuesday, and hope to have the great honor of serving you as your president. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Yes, you can because the question you were asking me were about children seeking asylum. And we have laws. That was the most critical thing I said. Under our laws. I would like to see those laws changed. I would like see added to them, a guaranteed counsel and other support for children. But if you are asking about everyone who is already here, undocumented immigrants, the 11-12 million who are living here, my priorities are to deport violent criminals, terrorists, and anyone who threatens our safety. So I do not have the same policy as the current administration does. I think it's important that we move to our comprehensive immigration reform, but at the same time, stop the raids, stop the round-ups, stop the deporting of people who are living here doing their lives, doing their jobs, and that's my priority. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~Yes.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~you know though, I guess Senator Sanders, that the Koch brothers, as you said, are sensible with how they use their money. And I agree with you. They stand for things that I find abhorrent, that would be bad for our country, bad for our future.But they did just put up a little video praising you for being the only Democrat who stood with the Republicans to try to eliminate the Export/Import Bank, which has helped hundreds and hundreds of companies here in Florida be able to export their goods and employ more Floridians. So from my perspective, you sided with the Koch brothers. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~You know, look. I feel a great deal of sympathy for the families of the four brave Americans that we lost at Benghazi. And I certainly can't even imagine the grief that she has for losing her son, but she's wrong. She's absolutely wrong.I and everybody in the administration, all the people she named, the president, the vice president, Susan Rice, we were scrambling to get information that was changing, literally by the hour. And when we had information, we made it public. But then sometimes we had to go back and say we have new information that contradicts it.So I testified for 11 hours. [applause]Anybody who watched that and listened to it knows that I answered every question that I was asked and when it was over the Republicans had to admit they didn't learn anything. Why? Because there had already been one independent investigation. There had been seven or eight congressional investigations, mostly led by Republicans who all reached the same conclusions, that there were lessons to be learned.And this is not the first time we lost Americans in a terrorist attack. We lost 3,000 people on 9/11. We lost Americans serving in embassies in Tanzania and Kenya when my husband was president. We lost 250 Americans, both military and civilian, when Ronald Reagan was president in Beirut.And at no other time were those tragedies were they politicized [applause].Instead people said, let's learn the lessons and save lives. And that's when I did. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~You know, most of the property in Florida will be at risk in the next 50 years. I think I can get a bipartisan consensus on resilience and then implementing the president's orders until we frankly win back enough seats, take back the Senate, and get back to bipartisan [crosstalk]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 9, 2016~You know, you don't &mdash; you know, you don't have to do much more than look at rising insurance rates.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~A brief response.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation. And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria. And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes. And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people. It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all. That is not what America is supposed to be about. So I believe that working with Europe &mdash; and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world. You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia. They have a responsibility, as well. But I think this is a worldwide &mdash; that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners. We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education. And I think when you give low-income kids &mdash; African-American, white, Latino kids &mdash; the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail. They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Here is where we are with public education. A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms. Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education. And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade. The world has changed. This is 2016. In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago. So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities. That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken. I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~I find &mdash; I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here. Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory. Not everybody remembers that. You do. I do. The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. That's what he talked about, the great threat of China. And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China. The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China. Not my kind of guy. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited. And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~In all due respect [applause] In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question. Are you coming onboard a proposal? And what is that proposal? Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008. You opposed him then. I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do. We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity. I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~It is.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs. Secretary of state for four years. You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine. But judgment matters as well. Judgment matters as well. And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq. I lead the opposition against it. She voted for it. But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent. Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Judy, one area very briefly
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Let me &mdash; let me just say this. What a President of the United States has got to do and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility is to, a, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values, that we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them. And if you go to my Web site,berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred. Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change. Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world. And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator. We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to. We got rid of Gadhafi. But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after. And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi. But what happened is a political vacuum developed. ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold. But this is nothing new. This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments. Mossadegh back in 1953. Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran. He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British. And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator. The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today. Unintended consequences. So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences. I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country. And I will tell you something that really galls me. I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy. Just a little bit. All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government. Government is the enemy. We're going to cut Social Security to help you. We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible. But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America. If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Let me just &mdash; just say this. For a start, the secretary and I disagree &mdash; and I think the president does not agree with her &mdash; in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria. I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago. I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement. Let's hope that it holds.But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow. But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba. And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well. But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve. And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations. That's how you make peace in the world. You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here. When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up. I think he would have been right. I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation. I think that would have been right, as well. That's my view. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans. We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class. I am very proud, if my memory is not correct &mdash; I think I am &mdash; that I have a lifetime &mdash; and I've been in Congress a few years &mdash; a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record. I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women. I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men. And we will join the rest of the other &mdash; the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~No, I think the idea was that president &mdash; then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents. It's easier to talk to your friends. It's harder to talk to your enemies. I think we should do both. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with. This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea. It takes away discretion from judges. We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies. [applause] We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity. And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see. People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up &mdash; we're shocked that they end up back in jail again. So, we have a lot of work to do. But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge. When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size. Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country. We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth. Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation. And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth. And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors &mdash; and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country &mdash; who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security. And you know what? You do the arithmetic. You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year. And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference. I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000. [applause] And when we &mdash; and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security. We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years. Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes. But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime. That is not what America should be about. If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here. If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country. That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position. In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it. I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery. Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country. So it wasn't just me who opposed it. It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country. It was the AFL-CIO. It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason. But we are where we are right now. And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up. What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~That's my bill. Check it out.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~That is [applause] Madam Secretary, that is a low blow. I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years. When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month. We had a $1.4 trillion deficit. And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse. As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress. [applause]But you know what? Last I heard we lived in a democratic society. Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job. So I have voiced criticisms. You're right. Maybe you haven't. I have. But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said? The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process. That's what I said. That is what I believe. [applause]President Obama and I are friends. As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator. I have worked for his re-election. His first election and his re-election. But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president. I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue. Do senators have the right to disagree with the president? Have you ever disagreed with a president? I suspect you may have. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~That is absolutely inaccurate. Look, here is the reality, folks. There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people. There is one major country &mdash; the United States &mdash; which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people. Please do not tell me that in this country, if &mdash; and here's the if &mdash; we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~The answer is yes. We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country. I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported. I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported. I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship. I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act. And in fact I would go further. What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up. And let me say this also. Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies. And I would not support those. Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~The people aren't dumb. Why in God's name does Wall Street  [applause] But let's not &mdash; but let's not &mdash; let's not insult &mdash; let's not insult the intelligence of the American people. People aren't dumb. Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions? I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around. [laughter] Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions? Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs? Why does the fossil fuel industry pay &mdash; spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions? Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system? [applause] And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street. I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it. In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough. But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash. No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~This is one of the great tragedies in our country today. And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug. It has to be dealt with. Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail. That is beyond unspeakable. So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system. [applause]What we have to do is end over-policing in African-American neighborhoods. The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates. The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana. Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations. The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites. We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system. I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers. What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~We have a lot of work to do. We have a lot of work to do. But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies. I have no illusion. Of course you are right. Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas. Everybody knows that. But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality. [crosstalk]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event. And, PBS, thank you. Nine months ago, our campaign began. And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont. A lot has happened in nine months. And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy. And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers. They are worried to death about the future of their kids. And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent. And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system. They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million. We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans. They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all. No criminal records for them. I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics. They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors. Thank you.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt. People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings. Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard. As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse. So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration &mdash; which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother &mdash; clearly, we are looking at institutional racism. We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger. That's for sure.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Well, let me just respond. I worked with Ted Kennedy. He was the chairman of my committee. And I loved Ted Kennedy. But on this issue, when you have one of the large Latino organizations in America saying vote no, and you have the AFL-CIO saying vote no, and you have leading progressive Democrats, in fact, voting no, I don't apologize for that vote. But in terms of the children, I don't know to whom you're sending a message. Who are you sending a message to? These are children who are leaving countries and neighborhoods where their lives are at stake. That was the fact. I don't think we use them to send a message. I think we welcome them into this country and do the best we can to help them get their lives together. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Well, let us level with the American people. Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program. I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people. We're not going to dismantle everything. But, here is the truth. Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America. We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing. Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments. What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle &mdash; the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars. In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.[applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama. I was not that candidate. [applause]All right, look, this has been a great debate. A lot of interesting issues have come together. Let me conclude by just saying this. There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone. This campaign is not just about electing a president. What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns. Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon. It ain't going to happen. Low income people who are not involved in the political process.What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power. Thank you all very much. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet. And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for. For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling? Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that? Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent? Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent. We need to create jobs. So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax. Yes, I'm going to do away with that. We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure. Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession &mdash; Great Depression. Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free. We bailed them out. Now it is their time to help the middle class. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Well, this is what I would say. It is a complicated relationship. I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement. As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed &mdash; men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country &mdash; their own country &mdash; it is unspeakable. It is a real horror. Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia. But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO &mdash; correctly, I believe &mdash; are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action. I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him. But bottom line is: The president is right. We have to put more money. We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled. In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going &mdash; getting poorer. What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people. Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year. I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free. I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind. Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating. Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about. We have to be honest about it. It is undermining American democracy. When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK? We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC? And, we said no. We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC. But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something. And, it turns out that up until &mdash; and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people. Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street. Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate &mdash; and I believe in her book &mdash; very good book, by the way &mdash; in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger. Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country. [applause] I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend. I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger. And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world. So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~White people?
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well. So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue. But it is a general economic issue.And here's what the economic issue is. The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be. Why is that? Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues. But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street. Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world. But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits. You once had a pension. Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone. They're off to China. Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone. What have you got now? You are working at McDonald's? That is why there is massive despair all over this country. People have worked their entire lives. They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make. Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all. And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down. Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power. [applause]
Bernie Sanders~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair. And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression. And then what he did is redefine the role of government. You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit. So what if mass unemployment exists? So what if children are going hungry? That's not the role of the government. And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish. And kind of &mdash; that's what I see our campaign is about right now. In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process. don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us. If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free. We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality. In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics. He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects. But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory. Those are two leaders that I admire very much. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Absolutely. And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve. There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities. I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore. And that's what I intend to do.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind. I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy. And for good cause. Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years. There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people. And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top. We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again. But I want to go further. I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now. African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system. Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future. Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve. I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential. That will be my mission as president. And I think together we will make progress.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me. They are the ones who should respond to any questions. Let's talk about our campaigns. I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions. So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters. I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side. That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is. I think that is the real key here. We both have a lot of small donors. I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side. The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda. It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country. We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage. You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare. And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage. [applause] And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment &mdash; namely the Affordable Care Act &mdash; is because I know how hard it was to get that done. We are at 90 percent coverage. We have to get the remaining 10. I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs. And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share. But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work. If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system. The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program. So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing. And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said. And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world. I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.But I want to &mdash; I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test. And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama. In the past he has called him weak. He has called him a disappointment. He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy. And I just couldn't agree &mdash; disagree more with those kinds of comments. You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president [applause] who got us out of that [applause] put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future. And it is a &mdash; the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans. I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~I strongly support the president's executive actions. I hope the Supreme Court upholds them. I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did. I am against the raids. I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up. We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country. I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform. Have been ever since I was in the Senate. I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act. I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007. Senator Sanders voted against it at that time. Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade. Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country. And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.[applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~I think &mdash; I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement. We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system. I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund. I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially. First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs. I want to take care of women. When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked. And women have been disadvantaged ever since. They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities. And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment. So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program. But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~I will put a price tag. My price tag is about $100 billion a year. And again, paid for. And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt. I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing. And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that. But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~If I could just respond. Two points. One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime. He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on. I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016. It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in. When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in-chief. And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them. As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq. And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state. I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans &mdash; let's take healthcare for example. Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare. Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math. This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths. People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived. This is a remarkable and horrifying fact. And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal. You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us? Do people not care about all of our sacrifice? And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country. I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has &mdash; the 10-20-30 proposal &mdash; to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty. And you know what? If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out. So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans &mdash; particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have &mdash; you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is. And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be. We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough. So we have to go after this both abroad and at home. We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS &mdash; that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute. We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS. That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in. We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi. We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so. And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters. And we have to take on ISIS online. They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence. Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement. We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed. But the final thing I want to say about this is the following. You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it. And we need to do that throughout the country. But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense. They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society. So when somebody like Donald Trump and others [applause] stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home. It's not only offensive; it's dangerous. And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations. I know how to do that. I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program. [applause] And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion. So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~No. But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family? In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward. I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning. There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government. I'm aware of that. It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said. The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions? I said no. And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions. That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Thank you.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~That's fine. That's fine. [laughter] You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas. I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America. [applause] So if we want to pick and choose &mdash; and I certainly do &mdash; people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Two quick responses. One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers. I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law. And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill. And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done. And I was proud to stand with him and support it. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~We are mixing apples and oranges. My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations. I'm very proud. That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country. But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me. It's not my PAC. If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent. I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever. Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street. He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's. So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.[applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me. I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society. And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face. So I'm going to keep making that case. I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known. But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support. I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me. That's what I'm working towards. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment. I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did. We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone. So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society. I think President Obama has set a great example. I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward. Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next. We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system. We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education. I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women. But, we can't rest. We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before. So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open. Nobody can deny them. To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out. So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.[applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Well, I know journalists have asked who you do listen to on foreign policy, and we have yet to know who that is.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Well, I respectfully disagree. I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program. That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement. I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran. Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism. Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos. Yes, they've got to get out of Syria. They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas. They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel. We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union. And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this. With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part. And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U. in particular.This is a humanitarian catastrophe. There is no other description of it. So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe. We have to stand with them. We have to provide financial support to them. We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on. And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Well, let's just &mdash; let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk. I think that's a major accomplishment. I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason. I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face. It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse. It was a big insurance company, AIG. It was Countrywide Mortgage. My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be. And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective. It goes in the right direction. We have Dodd-Frank. We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate. But let's not kid ourselves. As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon. I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these [crosstalk][applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Well, let me just &mdash; let me just say, once again [applause] that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care. I believe we are on the path to doing that. The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again. And we are not England. We are not France. We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers. So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage. We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100. I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years. But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make. That's what I've always stood for. And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign. I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage. So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here. We both want to get more revenue in. I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the &mdash; raising the cap would apply to passive income. That has not been
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen. I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it. So I'm going to come up with the best way forward. We're going to end up in the same place. We're going to get more revenue. I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Well, that just wasn't &mdash; that just wasn't the fact, Senator. The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border. So we have a disagreement on this. I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made. The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria. The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to. You know, the Russians wanted to buy time. Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire? So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible. But I would add this. You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution. At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together. This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia. We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view. This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake. Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me. Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter. So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition. And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups. So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like. So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on. And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden. I looked at the evidence. I looked at the intelligence. I got the briefings. I recommended that the president go forward. It was a hard choice. Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that. And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision. So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision. I'm proud that I gave him that advice. And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders. The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration. The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average. And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us. His family certainly believes that. And so do I. So we have work to do. There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen. President Obama's policing commission came out with some. I have fully endorsed those.But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect. And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level. But, I would also add this. There are other racial discrepancies. Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities. So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~You know, I have said &mdash; I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman. I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander-in-chief. [applause] And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record. And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues. I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues. Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights. So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans. And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition. We differ, however, on a couple of key points. One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go. And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free. I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that. [applause]
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements. As a senator, yes, I was a senator. I understand we can disagree on the path forward. But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
Hillary Clinton~Democratic Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~February 11, 2016~You know, we &mdash; we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics. We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again. But here's the point I want to make tonight. I am not a single-issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country. I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on. And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before [applause] the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues. Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence? You're right. But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint. We would still have racism holding people back. We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay. We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday. And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions. So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs. [applause]
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~[inaudible] absolutely they should be accountable. They should be accountable to their students through the market. Look, you either trust the American people to make their own choices or you don't.I know the Left thinks we need to be protected from ourselves. President Obama is trying to limit competition to the higher education market. As a result, you're going to see tuition prices continue to go up. We've had $1 trillion of student debt and counting. And he wants to exempt certain schools from the same oversight he wants to apply only to the for-profit market.For some reason, the private sector is a bad word to this president. It's not in the real world.In Louisiana, we fought so that the dollars follow the child and so the child following the dollar. What that means, from K-12, what that means is that parents and their families can decide what's the best way for their children to be educated. Higher education, we have a TOPS program, where, again, we will help if a student maintains a 20 ACT, 2.5 GPA, we'll pay for their tuition. They can take those dollars for private school of their choice in the state as well.You either trust the American people or you don't. I know the Left doesn't. That's why you get ObamaCare. They want to tell us what kind of insurance to buy. That's why you get Common Core, they want to take away our gun rights under the Second Amendment. They want to take away our religious liberty rights.So, yes, there's accountability. There's accountability to students through choice and competition. We don't need the nanny state to protect us from ourselves.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~[inaudible] willing to stand up and fight
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~A couple things. You're talking about payroll taxes that fund programs. People pay for their Medicare, they pay for their Social Security.I want every American to worry and care about how those folks in D.C. are spending our money. If $18 trillion of debt &mdash; they're misspending our money. Earned success is so much more fulfilling than unearned success.I don't want us to continue to create one class of Americans that pays income taxes, that pays for government, another class of Americans that's growing more and more dependent on government.That's what we have today. Socialism is bad, not only for taxpayers, but people that they say they're trying to help. There's dignity in work, dignity in self-sufficiency.I wanna quote you a president. Our previous president said this: he said, "the problem is, is that tax rates are too high, government income revenues are too low."He said, "paradoxically, lowering tax rates now is the best way to produce higher government revenues later." No, that wasn't President Reagan, as many are probably guessing at home. That was President Kennedy.I see you know the answer. That was President Kennedy. Imagine if he were alive today &mdash; and if he was at that last Democratic debate, imagine if you tried to say that in a party that's veering towards socialism. That wouldn't be welcome in today's Democratic party.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Absolutely, Jhon. And what we did is we cut state spending. We've cut our budget 26 percent, according to Cato and other analysis, the only candidate that's actually reduced government spending.Look, the left always complains there's not enough money for government. We have 30,000 fewer state employees than the day I took office, eight credit upgrades, we're a top 10 state for private sector job creation.We've got a choice. You grow the government economy or the American economy. When I became governor, we had 25 years in a row of outmigration. We were coming back from Katrina. The question many were asking, will Louisiana rebuild, should Louisiana rebuild?Seven years in a row, more people moving into the state than were leaving the state.We now have more people working than ever before, erg a higher income than ever before.Yes, we've reduced the size of government. That's exactly what we need to do in DC. In DC, the Republicans slowed the growth rate, they claimed victory. That's not enough.Let's be honest with where we are today. We are running off of a cliff. Look, we'll be the next Greece and we can talk and we can rearrange the chairs. Over over $18 trillion of debt, no wonder our economy has been stagnant. We haven't had real growth.If you're a young student here, you've not seen a robust American economy.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Absolutely, John. I'd go further. My tax plan, like everybody's, like a lot of Republicans' &mdash; look, I'd get rid of the death penalty and the marriage penalty, and I'd simplify the brackets to 25 percent, 10 percent, 2 percent, so that an average middle-class family &mdash; a teacher marries a law enforcement official (ph)
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I &mdash; I'm gonna get that. Pays 25 percent today, would pay 10 percent under my plan. But my plan does three things different from other people's plans.One &mdash; remember, I said 2 percent. I think everybody should pay something, even if it's only 2 percent. That's the most important 2 percent in my plan.I know a lot of Republicans brag &mdash; y'all can clap, it doesn't scare me. Go ahead. I heard some people.There are millions of &mdash; there are millions of folks that wouldn't pay taxes in Jeb's plan and Trump's plan. I think that's a mistake.In terms of the corporate tax, secondly, I'd get rid of the corporate tax. We do have the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. I'd get rid of it. I'd get rid of all the corporate welfare. Make the CEOs pay their same tax rates the way the rest of us do.And third, I'd purposely shrink the size of government. You know, that is a &mdash; that is an intentional feature of my plan. We've got a choice: do we grow government &mdash; the government economy, or the American economy?So I say get rid of the corporate tax, bring those jobs and investment here to the United States, stop sending jobs and investment overseas.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I think that's a false choice. If I were &mdash; I were to lead, we would pass a conservative budget, challenge the President to do the right thing. And, here's the problem, the Republicans never want to fight. Give Pelosi and Reed credit, they forced Obamacare and socialism down our throats, why won't the Republicans fight half as hard for freedom and opportunity. This was a bad budget.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I think the reason voters are so frustrated is nothing seems to change in D.C. Look, over the next several hours, you're going to hear several Republicans all tell you they want to shrink the size of government and grow the American economy and it sounds great and we've got to do it.Here's the truth &mdash; of all these folks talking, I'm the only one that has cut the size of government. There's not two of us, there's one of us. The rest of it is all just hot air. When politicians talk, we need to pay attention to what they do, not what they say.I'm the only one that's reduced the size of government. Let's shrink the government economy. Let's grow the American economy.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I was just saying to my colleagues, I may be the last person in this audience without an iPhone. I'm actually one of the last folks &mdash; I still have a BlackBerry in my pocket. And I basically use it for scheduling. I use it to keep up when my wife is here and my three kids at home.The only games on that phone are Bricklayer. I use it to keep up with the news through the Internet. I may be the last American out there without an iPhone.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~John, our budget is balanced. We balanced our budget every year for eight years. Yeah, we've had to cut spending. You know what? We privatized or closed nine of our 10 charity hospitals. We did statewide school choice; $1.6 billion (ph) budget cut.You're quoting an old number from the beginning of the year. We closed that gap. What they talk about, just like D.C., government's the only place where you give them less money than they wanted, they count it as a cut. They take last year's budget. They add inflation. They call it a baseline. We need to do zero-based budgets. We need to say just because you got money last year, you don't have it this year.Let me close, though. We balanced our budget. We didn't raise taxes. In eight years, we never raised taxes. We cut taxes. Our &mdash; our taxpayers, our families have been better off for it.[crosstalk]
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Look, I think the government should work to change that, but that doesn't &mdash; does not mean I'm for the government mandating that.We already have too many government mandates out of DC.Do I want people to have paid leave?Sure.Do I want people to earn higher wages?Sure.Do I want them to have better benefits?Sure. The government can't wave a magic wand and make that happen.Here's the problem. The last seven years, President Obama has tried to teach the American people that government is the answer to all of our problems.Where has that gotten us?We're on a path toward socialism. The way that folks can get better paying jobs with better benefits is if we have a growing economy. That means to repeal all of ObamaCare, a lower flatter tax code.That means that we have an energy plan that makes sense. That means that we embrace an all of the above approach to energy. Those are good paying jobs &mdash; $50,000, $70,000, $90,000 a year jobs with benefits.But this president won't let us produce more energy on our domestic federal lands and waters. He won't allow the Canadians to build the Keystone Pipeline. He's got an EPA that's doing everything they can to kill private sector jobs in America.So, yes, I want families to have better paying jobs and better benefits, but we're not going to get that with a government mandate, we're going to get that with a growing economy.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~My apologies.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~My message is to conservatives, this is our hour. Thanks to the insanity, the incompetence of the Democratic party, the American people are ready to turn our government over to us. It's not enough to let just any Republican, however. The reality is the idea of America is slipping away.As Christians, we believe that the tomb is empty. As Americans, we believe that our best days are always ahead of us, and they can be again. We must win this election. We cannot allow Hillary Clinton to take us down this path towards socialism &mdash; further down this path.I've got the courage to apply our conservative principles. I can't do it alone. With your help, with God's grace, we can save the idea of America before it's too late.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Thank you.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, absolutely, when the Saints go back to repeat, we were talking about beer sales earlier, all those folks from being hung over in Louisiana from drinking to celebrate Drew Brees winning this, I think it would be a great day to take off.No, look, on a serious note, I do want to say this about the Super Bowl and our athletes. They can be great role models for our children and I'm obviously a Saints fan. Drew Brees and his wife great role models, great Christians.So, yes, it should be a holiday.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, Jhon, a couple of things.Not only did we not raise taxes, we did the largest income tax cut in the state's history. And I'm proud of that record. I think that's the kind of leadership voters want in DC.Look, if you want a Republican that's going go grow government spending, if you want a &mdash; a president or if you want a candidate who's going to income taxes, I'm not your guy.If you want somebody that's going to do and say the things that can't be said, can't be done, I'm asking a vote for me to join my cause. That's how dangerous these times are. This is &mdash; this is a &mdash; this is &mdash; these are dangerous times for America. I think we have a chance to rescue the idea of America, but if we don't do it now, four years will be too late from now.So, yes, I'm proud we cut taxes, we cut spending, 30,000 fewer state government bureaucrats than the day I took office. I absolutely will do that in DC.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, look, I think that's a false choice. I think this is a very bad deal. Whenever they tell us in D.C. they're going to cut tomorrow, that means they're never going to cut. Tomorrow never seems to happen. Instead, why don't we actually follow our conservative principles? Why not insist on structural reforms? Why not cut spending?I don't mean strength (ph) the growth rate, I mean, actually spend less. Why not a balanced budget in the amendment &mdash; an amendment to the Constitution? Why not a super-majority vote before they grow our taxes, before they grow the government faster than the economy?Let's be honest, $18 trillion dollars of debt. Record low participation rate in the workforce, record number of Americans on food stamps. We are going the way of Europe. The left is trying to turn the American Dream into the European Nightmare. If you're a Republican
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, thank you.Look, if Senator Santorum wants to concede the tax cut wing of the Republican Party, I'm happy to fight for that side of the Republican Party. He's exactly right. I explicitly want to shrink the size of government; 22 percent over 10 years is not too much. We cut our state budget 26 percent in eight years.This is a fundamental choice. We mustn't become a cheaper version of the Democratic Party, a second liberal party. We need to proudly say we're willing to cut taxes, shrink government, grow the American economy. President Kennedy said it to the Democratic Party. Why can't we say it in the Republican Party in 2015, let's cut taxes.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~&mdash; as they build America's future.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~&mdash; colleges so that we can
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~&mdash; do in America is honor blue collar work again. We have to honor the carpenter, the plumber, the electrician, who can actually build something and instead of just saying that a college degree live &mdash; delivers prestige, let's celebrate those who do things with their hands and elevate their skills using training in high school and community
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~&mdash; have a better quality workforce that we honor
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Becky, can I comment on this question?
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~But, I want to speak on this issue
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Hey, Rick.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I'm doing great.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I &mdash; I am a long suffering Jets fan. So my answer is obviously no, there's no reason to take off the day after the Super Bowl. [applause]But let me just add this. The Mets are going to win tonight. Let's go, Mets.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I think it was a bad deal, but I would have voted for it for a very simple reason. Barack Obama is the first president in American history to hold our military hostage. He knew that we needed funding for overseas contingency operations, $40 million dollars that would go to support our troops. And, he was prepared, and had vetoed it, unless this deal went through.I have two sons, they both served overseas. One in Iraq, and one in Afghanistan, and I understand that we have got to do far more to help our military, help our veterans, and help protect our security. This is a bad deal, but to protect our military, I would have signed it. Uh, it's not going to be the case, if I have a chance to lead this country, we're going to reduce the deficit, shrink the government, lower the tax burden and grow the private sector because that's how you solve deficits.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I think they have gone too far. I think we've seen Wall Street really blossom and do very well while the rest of the country is struggling, and it's because we have this corrupt connection between Wall Street and Washington.And, John, you were just talking about what loopholes would you get rid of. I would get rid of virtually every single one of them. They cost American taxpayers $1.4 trillion a year. I would throw them all out.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~In Washington, they talk over each other
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~John, can I quickly comment on this one [crosstalk]
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~John, no question Barack Obama inherited a economic disaster in 2009.But what did he do?Instead of focusing on pro-growth policies in the economy, he rammed through ObamaCare, the worst law of my lifetime, that hurt small businesses, hurt companies, raised taxes and almost completely eliminated one industry because of its taxes.The Fed had to act. And the Fed did act and appropriately in reducing interest rates but they've reduced them now for seven straight years, that's never happened before. They've been zero for way too long.They should raise the rates; the Fed should get out of manipulating the market and the Fed also, by the way, should reduce its balance sheet, $2.7 trillion. Let some of those bonds mature and put the money back in the banking system so our economy can grow.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Let me &mdash; let me try to get a word in edgewise.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~No, I don't support it. But let me go back a little bit here. We need to grow our economy faster. We've had the worst economic recovery since the Great Depression. And it's because of policy in Washington and policy at the Fed.And let me go back to Washington. In 2009 &mdash;
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~No, I don't think we need a military response, but we need a coordinated response. And I have to say that I think the Obama administration has been completely lax, to say the least, in dealing with these cyber-attacks, not just by governments like North Korea, but by, particularly, Chinese and other companies.And what I would do is put in place a policy where if we know a company, say, a Chinese company, is hacking into American companies, stealing trade secrets, as we know they do every day, we will retaliate against that company and say that that company's not going to be allowed to continue to do trade with the United States.I would also look at what we're doing at the federal level and put in place what Israel has done: a &mdash; one federal agency dealing with cybersecurity and charged with working across silos to make sure we have the best technology.And, Jim, I've gotta tell you something, talking about cybersecurity. Hillary Clinton put a server, an unsecure server, in her home as secretary of state. We have no doubt that that was hacked, and that state secrets are out there to the Iranians, the Russians, the Chinese and others.That alone should disqualify her from being president of the United States. [applause]
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~no, I would keep &mdash; first, yes, but what I would do is ii would lower the tax on manufacturing to the lowest in the developed world &mdash; 12 percent.We all have plans. I have a plan. We all have plans. My plan, the Tax Foundation said, would create five and a half million new jobs over the next decade.The difference, though, is I will get my plan enacted because, when I was governor of New York, I passed sweeping tax code &mdash; cuts in a Democratic state with a Democratic legislature.I &mdash; you know, Bobby, you're talking about your tax cuts? I cut taxes more than everybody on this stage, more than everybody on the next stage, combined. By more than the other 49 states, in New York state.I don't just have a plan. I will enact tax cuts, get rid of those loopholes and make the system fairer for all Americans.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~No, I wouldn't. I was going to say
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Not at all.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~R&D &mdash; R&D credits. Let the private sector do this, develop this innovation. And not only would we solve our problems, we would have clean energy, cheaper energy here.We could export those technologies to places like China and like India so we would grow our economy, have a far greater impact globally, have a secure domestic source of energy, and cleaner, healthier air.That's the solution. Embrace science, embrace innovation and change.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~replace coal plants &mdash; government's roles &mdash; is to incentivize innovation and the entrepreneurial spirit in America. We could have far more clean energy.We could have next-generation nuclear, thorium reactors that have no risk of meltdown. We could have solar panels on every home that are four times more efficient than today.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Thank you for the opportunity to be with this great audience tonight.I'm a limited government conservative and I mean by that that not just when it comes to economic issues leaving them to the state, but social issues, as well.And in that I differ from every single other candidate seeking the Republican nomination.I take the Tenth Amendment very, very seriously.I'm a Republican who embraces science and understands we have to work with the next generation of millennials to have the innovation and technology so that we can grow a 21st century economy.And I'm a Republican who understands in Washington, when you're a leader, you have to put aside partisan politics to do what's right for the people.We are one America. If we work together across party lines, there's no problem we can't solve and the 21st century will be America's greatest century.Thank you very much.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Thank you.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~The one I use the most is Uber. You know, I used to get driven [laughter] when I was governor, I had a driver. I don't anymore, but [crosstalk]. And it's an example of what millennials are doing to change America for the better. And I tweet a lot, too.So Uber, Tweet &mdash; Twitter and then I communicate with my family.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~We need an outsider to run our party and to win the next election. Washington has become a corrupt insider game and everybody talks about how they're going to change the taxes, grow the economy. Nothing seems to change.But, by the way, Bobby, I shrunk the size of New York State's government when I left. We had reduced the employment by over 25,000 and cut taxes.But I understand that to change Washington you have to understand government as well. You can't just be an outsider. You can't just be someone who throws stones at Washington. You have to be someone who can actually bring people together across party lines.I can do that, I will do that if I have the chance to lead this party.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Yeah, absolutely. I &mdash; one of the things that troubles me about the Republican Party is too often we question science that everyone accepts. I mean, it's ridiculous that, in the 21st century, we're questioning whether or not vaccines are the appropriate way to go. Of course they are. And it's also not appropriate to think that human activity, putting CO2 into the atmosphere, doesn't make the earth warmer. All things being equal, it does. It's uncontroverted.I think part of the problem is that Republicans think about climate change, say, "oh my God, we're gonna have higher taxes, more Obama, more big government, the EPA shutting down factories."That's not the solution that I see. I want Republicans to embrace innovation and technology. You know, there's one country in the world that has fewer greenhouse gas emissions than the rest of &mdash; of the world. You know what that is? The United States.Our emissions are lower than they were in 1995. Not because of a &mdash; of a government program, but because of fracking, private sector creation [crosstalk]
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Yes. Very simply, you guys talk over each other in Washington all the time. I'm not used to that. I listen when people talk.We have a skills gap. You mentioned the construction company. The construction industry says one of their biggest problems are they can't find the craftsmen to do the work.What we have to [crosstalk]
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~&mdash; and I intend to have their back as commander-in- chief. Make me commander-in-chief.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~&mdash; and make a merit-based immigration system that will help our economy. We're going to need workers in the future.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~&mdash; our enemies &mdash;
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~&mdash; system
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~&mdash; that we have to do is come to grips with the reality that we're facing as Americans. In 1950, there were 16 workers for every Social Security recipient. Today, there's three. In 20 years, there are two.I want to make sure that no American company leaves America because you can't find a worker.American workers always get the first preference. But if you can't find an American worker, after you advertise at a competitive wage, I don't want you to be at a loss. Bring people in based on merit. Let's take a broken immigration

Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Here's the problem. We're being walked all over because our commander in chief is weak in the eyes of our enemies. Do you think Putin would be in the Ukraine today if Ronald Reagan were president? Why are the Chinese stealing our intellectual property, hacking into our system? Why are they building islands over resource-rich waters? Because they can get away with it.At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, the foreign policy of Barack Obama needs to be replaced, and the last person you want to find to replace his foreign policy is his secretary of state.So to the Chinese, when it comes to dealing with me, you've got a clenched fist or an open hand. You pick. The party's over, to all the dictators. Make me commander-in-chief and this crap stops. [applause]
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I think everybody owes an obligation to the country. The ones that I'm most worried about are the 1 percent of Americans in uniform, who have been fighting this war for 14 years. They need a commander in chief who knows what the hell they're doing.My first job as President of the United States is to rebuild the military and use it smartly. Admiral Mullen said the debt is a big threat to our national security. He's right. But people go where they're welcome when it comes to job creation.If I'm President of the United States you will be welcomed in America.

I have been to the Antarctic. I've been to Alaska. I'm not a scientist, and I've got the grades to prove it.

I'm tired of telling people things that they want to hear, that we know we're not gonna do.We're not gonna eliminate the corporate tax. But we can make it lower. We're going to fix immigration, only if we work together. I want to secure the border because, if we don't, we're going to get hurt and hit again.I want to fix a broken visa system. I want to increase legal immigration, because we're gonna have a shortage of workers over time. As to the 11 million, I want to talk about fixing the problem. We're not going to deport 11 million people and their legal citizen children.But we will deport felons.

And let me tell you, our Democratic friends have a list a mile long of more government. That's not going to grow the middle class, that's going to create a burden on your children, which they're already overburdened. The best way to grow the middle class is to make it a good place to create a job.You know why Boeing came to South Carolina when they could have gone anywhere to build the 787?Because we wanted them.

I have a military retirement. I'm in good shape. I would give up some of my benefits to help those who need it more than I do.To young people here, I will ask you to work a little bit longer because we have to. The purpose of my presidency is to save this country and to save Social Security by working across the aisle just like Ronald Reagan. This is the biggest issue facing this nation.

Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, let me tell you what is real. The threat to our homeland. I've never seen so many threats to our homeland than I do today. Barack Obama is an incompetent Commander in Chief. There are more terrorist organizations with safe havens to attack the American homeland than anytime since 9/11. We're in the process of reducing our defense spending by half.I am looking at this budget with one view in mind, will it restore the ability to defend this nation. We're on track to have the smallest army since 1940, the smallest navy since 1915, this budget, if it is paid for, will put $40 billion dollars back in the defense department at a time we need it.The number one role of the federal government's to defend this nation, I intend to be a Commander in Chief that can win a war we cannot afford to lose.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, number one, Social Security is not just a concept to me. I know why it exists; 50 percent of today's seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check. I promise you, if you make me your president, I will save Social Security because I know why it exists.Now, if you're looking for good beer policy, I'm your best bet. My dad owned a bar. [laughter]I know beer. We grew up, my sister and myself, in the back of that bar in one room with my mom, my dad and my sister who's nine years younger. When I was 21, my mom was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. Neither parent finished high school. She died within a year. We were wiped out from the medical bills. And if it wasn't for a Social Security survivor benefit check coming into my family, we wouldn't' have made it because my dad died 15 months later.So I

[applause]Looking at their academic standards, the only way I could have gotten into this university is to be invited to this debate tonight. [laughter]But here's my take on things. Without national security, there is no economic security. Without the sacrifice of the veteran, all of our hopes and dreams are at risk.Just a few days ago, Hillary Clinton said that the problems with the V.A. are being exaggerated by Republicans. They are not, they are real.

Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~&mdash; with competition
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~[inaudible] and I
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~A true conservative wants to create a level playing field. That's what &mdash; that's what we're &mdash; that's what government is supposed to do. They're not supposed to favor one group over another.And when it comes to our manufacturers, the level playing field is not in the United States. It's international. And so the federal government should have laws, tax laws, regulatory laws and, yes, finance laws. There's 60 other ex-im banks all over &mdash; all over the world.Every major competitor for the United States' manufacturing dollar has one of those banks.And guess what? They use those banks a heck of a lot more than their &mdash; than the United States of America does, number one.So in order to have a level playing field, which is what conservatives talk about all the time, level playing field, then we have to have export financing and here's why.Because export financing doesn't help Boeing, or G.E.G.E. just lost a contract, you know what they did? They went to . They got the X.M. (ph) bank in France to support it, and what did they do? They moved manufacturing out of South Carolina, out of Texas, moved to &mdash; Hungary, and to France. G.E. is still making money. G.E. is still doing well, but American workers are out of jobs. That's why we have to have this level playing field so we can compete with the rest of the world.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~And I care about, by the way. I care about choices.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I grew up in a steel town of Western Pennsylvania, outside of Pittsburgh, and when I announced for president, I announced from the factory floor. When I talk about making America the number one manufacturer again in the world, it's not just talk. When I talk about having the opportunity for people to rise again, it's not just because it polls well.I represented the old steel valley of Pittsburgh. I represented a 70% Democratic district, and won with 60% of the vote. Why? Because I aligned myself with working men and women who feel that neither party, and certainly not Washington D.C. cares about them.You elect me, we will get American workers on the side of the Republican party, and we can not be stopped if we do.

Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~MLB, NHL, so I'm a big sports fan. And "The Wall Street Journal." Those are the three apps I use the most.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~No. I was in [crosstalk] was in Kansas City over the weekend to watch the Steeler game and about a third of the crowd were Steeler fans. So I'm usually not alone when I call on Steeler Nation.But we are used to being in the Super Bowl, so actually, it is in Pennsylvania already.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Thank you. Can I just say something about that?
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~That's not what's happening.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~that they consolidate into a small group. Then the left can say, "there is no competition, we need a single payer." That's why we have to repeal Obamacare. [applause]
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, first, since you mention Colorado, I want to thank the people of Colorado because four years ago you &mdash; gave me the honor of winning the nomination out here in the state of Colorado. On a night we won three states, and it catapulted us to win 11 states ultimately, so, I just want to thank you very, very much for that support, and &mdash; in response to that, I do drink a lot of Coors beer, so [laughter]I try to help. The answer is pretty simple. The answer is simple. There are no shortage of breweries around the United States of America. I &mdash; I do &mdash; as I travel around the country, I do pints and politics, and I go to breweries all over the place, and there &mdash; there's almost no town in America anymore that doesn't have a brewery, so I don't think we need to worry too much.They're obviously &mdash; if there's &mdash; if there's some anti- competitive issues, you know, we have agencies to look at that. But, no, I'm not &mdash; I'm not concerned that Americans are not going to have choices in beer.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, I &mdash; I would say this, that what you're seeing is &mdash; in health care, you're seeing a lot of consolidation, and that consolidation is occurring because of Obamacare.You're seeing it particularly in an area that I am concerned about, and that's in insurance &mdash; health insurance. You're seeing the big health insurance companies fold up.You've seen Obama try to seed health insurance companies, and they've all failed, I think, except one. Why? Because we have a system of Obamacare with minimum loss ratios that make it virtually impossible for a small insurer to operate effectively.And this was the motive behind Obamacare. This wasn't incidental. This was deliberate, to make it so impossible for small insurers to survive
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, if you look at my flat tax, it actually takes the best of what Steve Forbes, Art Laffer, many have been advocating for a long time, which is a very strong pro-growth tax code &mdash; very simple. And, it adjusts it to make sure that it is not regressive.We have a $2,750 per person tax credit &mdash; that's $2,750 off the taxes due, not a deduction, a credit. And, we think &mdash; in fact, if you run the numbers, no American who's going to be paying more taxes under our proposal, so, we've accomplished both.We have a system that has a low single rate, but we take care of American families. I'm talking about $2,750 per person. That means a family four, that's $11,000 dollar tax credit. That's a very, very strong pro-family &mdash; and if you looked at the Wall Street Journal today, and so many of the publications that have been out there, they've talked about how the biggest problem of the hollowing out of the middle of this country. For workers to be able to raise is actually, the breakdown of the American family.William Galston, a liberal, said that on the pages of the Wall Street Journal today that the key to poverty is families. So, we put forth a pro-growth &mdash; Steve Forbes plan, combined it with a pro- family plan, and that's why I think it's going to work out, and work effectively.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, if you look at our plan that I introduced, the 2020 Clear Vision for America, we increase growth by 10 percent, 1 percent a year. So we go from 2.3 to 3.3, in repealing Obamacare, it's another .7. So you're looking at 4 percent growth, according to the Tax Foundation.And unlike Donald Trump and Bobby Jindal, we don't add $10 trillion to the deficit. In fact, our plan, while it creates as many jobs as their plan does and grows the economy as much as theirs does, we are a revenue-neutral plan because I believe that we need to reduce the size of government, yes, but we also need to reduce our deficit, and we need to get our budget balanced so we can start paying down this debt. And adding a trillion dollars with a tax cut and getting no more growth is not the way to do it.But that's only half of it. The word "economy" comes from the Greek "euthokis" (ph) which means family. The family is the first economy. And the one thing that we do not talk about enough is how stable families are vitally important for the middle of America to be prosperous and to grow and be safe. And I will have policies, not just tax policies, but others that will make sure that families are strong again in America.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, since we're usually in the Super Bowl at the Pittsburgh Steelers Steeler nation, anybody?
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~What we should be &mdash; we shouldn't be putting tariffs on anything. That hurts working men and women in this country. What we should be doing is making our manufacturing more competitive.One of the reasons I introduced the 20/20 plan, a 20 percent flat tax on corporations, as well as on individuals, is so we can be competitive, so we can bring those manufacturing jobs back.You want to talk about cutting pollution? You do a little back- of-the-envelope. We &mdash; we produce, per dollar of GDP, about one-fifth of the CO2 and other pollutants that China produces. So we're five times more efficient in producing goods here, as far as the environment &mdash; environment is concerned.Why don't we &mdash; if we really want to tackle environmental problems, global warming, what we need to do is take those jobs from China and bring them back here to the United States, employ workers in this country.We've lost two million jobs &mdash; two million jobs &mdash; under this administration in manufacturing &mdash; 15,000 manufacturers have left this country. Why? Because of bad tax policy, bad regulatory policy and, yes, bad trade policy.We need to have a president that's going to pledge, as I have &mdash; I'm going to make America the number-one manufacturer so working men and women can have good paying jobs again in America.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Yes, I think it's one thing to shrink the size of a state government but it's another thing to actually get something accomplished in Washington. It's a much tougher field.And I'm the one in the &mdash; on this stage and, frankly, on both stages that has actually gone to Washington, said we would shrink government, said we would shake things up and actually delivered for the conservative cause, everything from welfare reform, which was the largest, most significant accomplishment in the last 25 years for conservatism.I authored the bill when I was in the House of Representatives; I managed the bill on the floor of the United States Senate. You need a conservative who can deliver and that's what I bring to the table.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I'll say this. I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid. I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid. I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today. We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Socialist and government dependent.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law. I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups. I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, a couple of things. Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood. This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation. Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood. In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate. We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract. They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana. But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics. It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight. Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves. They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty. They didn't do that. They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority. They didn't do that either. They said they'd shrink and balance the budget. They haven't done that. Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, first of all, thank you all for having us. You know, I won two record elections. Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state. Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular. That's not why I ran for office. I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana. We've cut 26 percent of our budget. We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office. I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time. As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation. And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars. We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row. My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes. I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead. Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel. I think the American people are look for real leadership. That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, this goes to the question you were just asking. Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare. They do celebrate more dependence on the government. Give Bernie Sanders credit. At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist. Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better. If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance. We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart. This isn't free money. I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money." We pay federal taxes. We are borrowing money from China today. Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this. He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government." The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C.. There is a better way to provide health care. The Oregon study showed this. Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes. In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront. We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism." Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians. How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence. We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds. Well, you know what? Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists. We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military. We will arm and train the Kurds. We will work with our Sunni allies. They know we will be committed to victory. We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground. Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs. We'll go to the Congress. This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops. I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win. You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president. We've already got a great talker in the White House. We cannot afford four more years of on the job training. We need a doer, not a talker. We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles. Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general. Let me translate that for you. That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us. That never works. If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again. One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration. We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion. We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally. They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work. I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division. I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this. I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause. It is time to believe in America again.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails. She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner. 2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation. We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring. I am not a member of the political class. I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support. I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation. Thank you.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I agree with my colleagues. We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations. But let me go back to something that's very important. We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism. Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us. Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence. Progressives don't believe that. They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others. That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals. It turns out we knew something was wrong. It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms. We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected. So we need to get on a different mindset. Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis. But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting. We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens. I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem. But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector. And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted. A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office. I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?" You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time. It's what I've done or not done, or it's war. It is a false choice. King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel. We have not provided them. He has gone to China. The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years. We haven't done so. The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence. We're not doing it. We have Arab allies. They are not perfect. I know every one. But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Not trustworthy. No accomplishment.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~This is a great nation. It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government. We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation. I will do that.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, I don't know. I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race. Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton? I didn't. Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign. Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness. He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him. I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel. They're sick of politics as usual. You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you. That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into. I would also just say this. Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama. I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries. I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us. Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time. But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others. We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again. Thank you.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Yeah. Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white. On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls. The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel. The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran. He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system. I hope Congress says no to this deal. But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing. China and Russia have never been on our side of the table. The Europeans have moved on. We have to stop the money flow. And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this. America is back in the leadership business. And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place. This is a bad deal. Obama broke every rule of negotiation. Yes, our allies are not perfect. But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo. In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years. I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders. But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions. I'd sign that executive order. When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent. We can do that in Washington. I will do that in Washington.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Divisive and with no vision. No vision at all.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I think he is right. I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years. But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change? The answer is no. And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare. On welfare. Think about that. And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture." But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better. I changed that. We put in place mandatory work fair (ph). But we allowed people to keep health care. We put in place child care support.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile. I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing. Yes, I thought about running four years ago. I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run. But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems. What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state. But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America. And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together. We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates. We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest. I can do that. And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state. So we need new leadership -- yes. I will be that new leader.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here. That is not protected free speech. That is not protected religious belief. That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested. Think back to Garland, Texas. But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder. We have to shut down their internet capability. We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching. No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech. Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there. We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers. I was governor of New York on September 11. I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack. We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here. I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars. What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out. You know, I have two sons. Both served. One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan. I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night. I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary. But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion. I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception. But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it. But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions. Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life. What else we can do is that we should believe in science. You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science? Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb. And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect. So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks. It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~No, it should be repealed. And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~replacing dependency with opportunity.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~With all the candidates, why me? My background is different. I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes. Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government. I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times. And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs. I can govern by bringing people together. And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has. I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time. And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime. We need to bring people together in Washington. The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin. People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York. I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Yes.
Jim Gilmore~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs. Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy. And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question. I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program. We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans. We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent. We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world. And we're going to eliminate the death tax. With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do. It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs. And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused. And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare." These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag. I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
Jim Gilmore~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I think the times are different now. I think the times are much more serious. Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline. I want to reverse that decline. That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it. Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices. A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running. I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany. I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years. I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues. I was a governor during the 9/11 attack. I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
Jim Gilmore~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Not -- not on that, no. But let me say one more thing. I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran. It is Iran that's the expansionist power. ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state. Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two. I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
Jim Gilmore~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Professional politician that can't be trusted.
Jim Gilmore~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this. I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law. Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body. They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law. Bill, I want to say one more thing about
Jim Gilmore~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record. But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change. And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people. And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous. I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country. It's time for real substance and real experience. And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
Jim Gilmore~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill. The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist? The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal. Illegal. And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law. If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other. We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
Jim Gilmore~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, yes, indeed. I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States. We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred. I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck. And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country. We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country. It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks. We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted. We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack. We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack. And I would not stand for that as president of the United States. I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies. Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn. The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president. You want to see a war on women? Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks. I've been there 35 times. I will show you what they do to women. These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist. If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must. I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation. If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I think America is dying to work, you just need to give them a chance. To all the Americans who want a better life, don't vote for Hillary Clinton. You're not going to get it. She's not going to repeal "Obamacare" and replace it. I will. She's not going to build the Keystone Pipeline. I will. She's not going to change Dodd-Frank. I will. Until you change the policies of Barack Obama, we're never going to grow this economy. Until you change the policies of Barack Obama, we're never going to be safe. She represents a third term of a failed presidency. I'm fluent in Clinton-speak; I've been dealing with this crowd for 20 years. You know, when Bill Clinton says it depends on what the meaning of is is, that means is is whatever Bill wants it to mean. When Hillary Clinton tells you I've given you all the emails you need, that means she hasn't. So to the people who are dying for a better America, you better change course, and she doesn't represent the change that we need. Do we all agree that ISIL is not the JV team? If I have to monitor a mosque, I'll monitor a mosque. If I have to take down a cyber wall, I'll take it. If I have to send more American troops to protect us here, I will do it. She will not. She has empowered a failed agenda. She is going to empower a failed solution to an American economy dying to grow. Elect me, I know the difference between being flat broke. Apparently, she doesn't. In Hillary Clinton's world, after two terms in the White House where her husband was president, she said she was flat broke. Hillary, I'll show you flat broke. That's not it.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you. One thing I want to be clear about tonight. If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief. And you're not serious about destroying ISIL. According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL. We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force. According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation. I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL. Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Not the change we need at a time we need it.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Right.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Thank you. First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do. To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice. We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill. I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill. When I was 21, my mom died. When I was 22, my dad died. We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back. Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed. Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids. I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future. Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check. If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party. I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation. This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago. That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel." And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all. We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together. We're becoming Greece if we don't work together. At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions. In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment. In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less. Over time, we're going to become energy independent. I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts. The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America. A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
Rick Perry~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression. I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us. And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
Rick Perry~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Bill, here's the interesting position on this. Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration? For 30 years this country has been baited with that. All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure. The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason. We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous. Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border. We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come. At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until. If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
Rick Perry~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one. We're going to start the process of securing that border. I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
Rick Perry~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~It's good to be with you.
Rick Perry~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~It will be a long day.
Rick Perry~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East. We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message. And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding. One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran. And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing. I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry. Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away. But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
Rick Perry~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, let's go with three. Good at email.
Rick Perry~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election. I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had. And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for. 1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs. We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest. As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America. Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it. And that was the state of Texas. And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America. Our best days are in front of us. We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it. We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country. Manufacturing will flow back into this country. It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before. And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years. And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country. And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
Rick Perry~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it. One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year. I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity. Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen. I've had my issues with Donald Trump. I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism. How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care? I mean, I ask that with all due respect. And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border. We sent our Texas ranger recon teams. We sent our parks and wildlife wardens. I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did. We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America. Karen and I have seven children. You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country. I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country. Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration. And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C. You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes. They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can. ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about? Helping business make profits. There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker. I'm looking out for the American worker. I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration. Actually going to do something to help the American worker. And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today. That's why I ask for your support for president.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990. That sounds like a long time ago. It was. It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent. I came as a reformer. I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said. I was a child of Ronald Reagan. And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done. That's the difference. We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before. Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues. Those of you health savings accounts. Health savings accounts are something that we introduced. It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control. Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done. If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch. Number one, we have to create better paying jobs. I mean, that's just the bottom line. We haven't. And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world. If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it. I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America. It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS. It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country. And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system. You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes. Got 70 votes in the United States Senate. Bipartisan issue. And I ended a federal entitlement. Never been done before, never been done since. What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare. Work requirements and time limits. That will change everything.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap. We were behind where we were today. But we stuck to our message. We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again. Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them. I've got a track record. The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done. Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~It is not any more than Dred Scott was settled law to Abraham Lincoln, who, in his first inaugural address, said "it won't stand." And they went ahead and passed laws in direct contravention to a rogue Supreme Court. This is a rogue Supreme Court decision, just like Justice Roberts said. There is no constitutional basis for the Supreme Court's decision, and I know something about this. The -- one of the times the Supreme Court spoke that I thought they were acting outside of their authority was in a partial-birth abortion case. You know, these Planned Parenthood tapes, what they're showing are partial-birth abortions. Abortions being done where the baby's being delivered first, to preserve those organs, and then they crush the skull. Well, the Supreme Court found a bill that I was the author of unconstitutional. What did I do? I didn't stop. I didn't say "oh, well we lost. It's the law of the land." We worked together. The House and Senate, under my leadership, and we passed a bill, and we said, "Supreme Court, you're wrong." We're a coequal branch of the government. We have every right to be able to stand up and say what is constitutional. We passed a bill, bipartisan support, and the Supreme Court, they -- they sided with us. Sometimes it just takes someone to lead and stand up to the court.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Just ditto to that. We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years. We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom. And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country. And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years. Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini. Not a very pleasant place to be. I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this. And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?" You know what he said to me? "America was worth the wait." We're a country of laws, Bill. We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do. I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best. But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws. And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans. And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else. It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan. It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent. We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different. We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~He is right there. He is right there.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~In over 150 events I have come to know and love the people of Iowa. And the people of Iowa know what the rest of Americans have figured out, this ain't working anymore. The government no longer works for those who pay for it. The professional political class says and does whatever they need to do to win, and then does whatever they please.We need to return to a citizen government. That is why I am running for President. The media, the establishment, they all want to tell you this elections over, they know who's going to win it, except that you haven't  [bell rings]   cast a single vote yet. So, the people of Iowa, stand with me, fight with me. Caucus for me. It is time to take our country back.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~It wasn't a personal attack. I was pointing out the fact that Hillary Clinton will do anything to gain and hang on to power, anything. Listen, if my husband did what Bill Clinton did, I would have left him long ago. [applause] So, here's the deal. Hillary Clinton has been climbing the ladder to try and get power and here now she is trying for the White House. She is probably more qualified for the big house, honestly. [laughter] She has escaped prosecution more times than El Chapo, perhaps Sean Penn should interview her. [laughter] The woman should be prosecuted. [applause] And while Mrs. Clinton has flown hundreds of thousands of world around the global, I have too. And I know flying is an activity not an accomplishment. While I know that she has held many positions and many titles she has not accomplished much of anything in her life. She has gotten every single foreign policy challenge wrong. [bell rings] She continues to lie to the American people. It's called the Clinton way. Both Bill and Hillary practice it, the Clinton way. Say whatever you have to say, do whatever you have to say. Lie as long as you can get away with it. Hillary Clinton cannot be the president of these United States. [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Martha, can I just say we've been talking tonight about a lot of issues and we've also been talking about the fact that the game is rigged and frankly, the media has a lot to do with that. It is outrageous frankly, that Fox News, and you, would question the pro-life credentials of Rick Santorum. [applause] That is outrageous. [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well let me tell you this: news flash, President Obama, news flash, Mrs. Clinton -- climate change is not our most pressing national security threat. [applause]Actually -- actually, it is ISIS, followed closely by Iran. And those two things are linked, so that when our president cozies up to Iran, all of our allies in the Middle East, who are ready to help us defeat ISIS, wonder whose side we're on. And the truth is, under this president, we are on Iran's side, not our allies', who would help us defeat ISIS.You know, one of the things we have to start with is understanding that we must stand up to adversaries. So Hillary Clinton famously asked, what difference does it make how four Americans died in Benghazi? This is the difference it makes, Mrs. Clinton. When terrorists purposefully attack an American embassy and kill four Americans, including an ambassador, and the next morning you get up and you lie about a videotape that doesn't represent our values, instead of saying the United States of America was purposefully attacked by terrorists, and we will seek retribution, then you are saying to every adversary and every adversary and every terrorist organization on the planet, it's open season. That, Mrs. Clinton, is what difference it makes. [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, first of all, I haven't said that. What I have said is that in the process of examining every dollar, cutting any dollar and moving any dollar, we happen to know that in this vast federal bureaucracy we have about 260,000 federal government employees who are going to retire, and we shouldn't replace them.Secondly, at Hewlett Packard, as you know -- the people of Iowa know this -- we went through a tough time. The worst technology recession in 25 years -- a great company called Gateway used to do be right here in Iowa. But they didn't make the tough calls necessary to save all those jobs, and so they lost every one of those jobs.Yes, I've had to make some tough calls. We saved 80,000 jobs. We went on to grow to 160,000 jobs. And, frankly, I think the American people know we need a president who's going to make some tough calls.So let me tell you where I'm going to start. The American people got a bill passed through Congress that said we could fire the top 400 senior executives at the V.A. for dereliction of duty. When we know that 307,000 veterans have died waiting for health care and the V.A. handed out $142 million worth of bonuses for superb performance, I'm going to start by firing 400  [bell rings]   senior executives at the V.A. [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, you know, Hillary Clinton hasn't been indicted either. So that tells us a lot about our justice system in this country. But, look, the facts of Planned Parenthood have not changed, folks, and I will not be rendered silent on this issue or any other issue.And it doesn't matter what stage I'm on. Here are the facts. Planned Parenthood engages in partial birth abortion, in late-term abortion. They alter those abortion techniques to harvest and sell body parts. They have admitted that they are not going to accept compensation for this anymore.The reality is, most Americans find this practice horrific. Most Americans find horrific that Hillary Clinton's position on this is it's not a life until it's born. Most Americans find horrific Hillary Clinton's position or the Democrat party's position, that a young woman does not need her mother's permission to get an abortion.But if you are 13 years old, you can get an abortion, but you can't go to a tanning salon without your mother's permission. A president Fiorina -- in a president Fiorina budget, there will not be one dime for Planned Parenthood, although there would be a lot of money for women's health and we will finally pass the pain capable unborn child protection act. I will always stand for life and religious liberty  [bell rings]   because this is about the character of our nation. [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~You know, we have a professional, political class of both parties. We have been talking about the same issues for election cycle after election cycle. Yeah, government is big and out of control, and the only way to get it under control is to control the money.And the only way to control the money is to ask the federal government to budget the way you do, to examine every dollar, to cut any dollar to spend -- to move any dollar.The fancy word for that is zero-base budgeting. I call it common sense. That three-page tax code I talk about all the time here in Iowa? It's been around for 20 years. But politicians don't want to talk about it, and you bet the lobbyists don't want to talk about it.In fact, nobody wants to vote on a three-page tax code or zero- base budgeting, although they've both been around for a long time. You know why? Because if you get those two things done, you are goring everybody's ox.You are taking the political establishment apart. You are actually challenging the status quo, which is what we need in the Oval Office. So you know who I'm going to count on? The citizens of this great nation, because you have extraordinary power. But when you do not use it  [bell rings]   you are losing it. So take out your smartphones, folks. The people of Iowa know what I'm talking about. You take out your smartphones. if you agree with me that three-page tax code needs to be passed, lobbyists aren't going to be in my office. If you agree we gotta finally pass zero-base budgeting, take out your smartphones. Press one for yes, ladies and gentlemen. Press two for no. Citizens, we must take our country back. [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~You know, when I started my campaign on May 4th of last year, I was 17 out of 16 candidates. Nobody polled my name. Nobody had ever heard of me. Less than 4 percent of you had ever heard of me.The people in Iowa showed up and they are still showing up. Hundreds and hundreds of them at every event. I have done over 150 events in the state of Iowa and I have 15 more coming up. [applause] Now, by the way, I start there because someone asked me about midway through my campaign, what's the biggest surprise to you on the campaign trail? And I will tell you what the biggest surprise is: the chasm, the yawning chasm, between what the national media talks about and what the people of Iowa and the people of this great nation talk about. [applause] That's the biggest surprise. So guess what, Martha? Guess what, sorry. The people of Iowa never ask me about a crisis in the GOP, they never ask me about the polls. They never ask me about the other candidates. What they ask me about is Carly, tell us why zero based budgeting is so important. Tell us why you are a leader who is going to produce results. Tell us how you are going to defeat ISIS. Tell us how we are going to replace Obamacare.In other words, I'm going to put my faith every single time not in the pundits, not in the polls. Most definitely not in the national media. I'm going to put my faith in the common sense and the good judgment of the voters of Iowa. And the last time I looked, you hadn't started voting yet. So, on Monday night, I hope you will stand with me, fight with me, caucus for me. Because  [bell rings]   citizens, this is why we have to take our government back. The establishment thinks it owns this country. The pundits thinks they own this country. The media thinks they owns this country. We were intended to be a citizen government, citizens. The game is rigged. You have the power. Take our country back.
Jim Gilmore~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~First of all, Bill, I think that Gitmo ought to remain open. But I also want to point out to you that what you are saying is the exact right topic to all of these other candidates. And that's this international challenge that we are facing, the international war that America is in, even to this day.And I'm the candidate who is best qualified to deal with this issue. A degree in foreign policy in Russian area studies. I'm the only United States Army veteran having gone to Europe during the Cold War as United States Army Intelligence agent, the governor during the 9/11 attack, the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security for the United States for five years.And this is what I will do. If I become the president, I'm going to rebuild the United States military. We're going to take the sequester off the defense budget. Give the Navy the ships it needs. Refit the United States Army. Refit the United States Marine Corps.And on this international guerrilla war, we need to recognize our Special Forces, our intelligence community, and the people that we need in order to really protect us.And finally, this war of ideas, we must win this. We must say to the world that radical Islamism is the threat. It isn't just confined to ISIS. It is worldwide. And if we win the war of ideas, then we will win the international guerrilla war.
Jim Gilmore~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Hey, did you miss me? Did you skip me?
Jim Gilmore~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~I'll take it. [laughter]
Jim Gilmore~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~I'm going to have something to say about this, but you just keep going.
Jim Gilmore~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Martha, I just visited a community mental health clinic in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, just three days ago, as a matter of fact. And when I was governor of Virginia, I tried to move more of those resources into the community, which will give us the facilities and the abilities to begin to identify people who actually might be dangerous and who abuse Second Amendment rights.But I do believe this is one of the really principle issues in this campaign. The president and Hillary Clinton are working very hard to change the culture of this country in order to put us in a position where we can't exercise Second Amendment rights.That's wrong. I am a board member of the National Rifle Association. The reason I'm a board member is because I believe that individuals in this country can be trusted to exercise their rights under the Second Amendment and under the Bill of Rights. To take away people's Second Amendment rights is to redefine the individual in the society, and I'm not going to put up with it. As President of the United States, when Jim Gilmore's President of the United States, I can tell you this. Gun control is not going to be an issue. If gun control  [bell rings]   comes to the President's desk when I'm president, I'll veto it as fast as it takes Hillary Clinton to eliminate her emails. [applause]
Jim Gilmore~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, Bill, can I first
Jim Gilmore~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, first of all, Bill, let me say one thing, I have been in Iowa. But this is not the place where I'm choosing to begin my campaign. I am beginning my campaign in New Hampshire and I decided to do that based upon the process that is in place in Iowa and the primary that's in place in New Hampshire.But never mind that, I want to return to something. I'm the only veteran, Bill and Martha in this race. And I'm not going to any Donald Trump event over across town on some sort of faux veteran sort of issue.I'm going to speak to you tonight about the issue that really confronts veterans. I'm going to talk to you about the concerns that they have got with the veterans administration.The lousy appeals process that they have got. The fact that sometimes they get good service at the V.A. and sometimes they don't and the fact that post traumatic stress syndrome is not properly recognized. That psychology positions are unavailable in the Veterans Administration. And I will say this to you -- as the only veteran in -- in this race, when I become president of the United States, the veterans are going to be treated with respect and competently in success in the Veterans' Administration in this country.
Jim Gilmore~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, thank you very much, Bill. And, thank you, and Fox and Google for including me in this debate tonight. I think it's been a wonderful opportunity.I'm the son of a meat cutter. My father worked for Safeway stores for 45 years. My mother was a secretary, she ended her career as the Secretary for the Methodist Bishop. I didn't have a father that could give me a million dollar loan to start my business. But, my father did talk character, and he provided for his family, and he was a wonderful example.And, I'm not about to go across town tonight to carry the coat for some billionaire. Instead, I intend to run for President of the United States, speak to the issue of this international war, and challenge that we're in. This issue of veterans rights, and the issue of Second Amendment rights, and I ask for your support
Jim Gilmore~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Yes, I'll be there. [laughter]
Jim Gilmore~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~You know Bill, that raises, I think, the question of the future of the Republican party. The question is -- first of all, I stand second to no one in standing up to radical Islamism. I understand that ISIS is a piece of that but it is a world-wide phenomena that has manifested itself in Paris, in 9/11, in San Bernardino, in Boston.I recognize all that. But I also recognize this. This is a strain of Islamism that cannot be supported and cannot be stood for. And what we need is for people in the Muslim community in the United States to stand up and be counted and to say that this is not right.And yes, I have met with some people. And I'm not going to identify who they are. I met with them last week. And they told me some terrible stories about how they have been harassed and their children have seen them be harassed.And I said to them. You have got to stand up and condemn this radical Islamism because it's the war of ideas that we are going to have to win to go along with our military conflicts that are coming forward. But the point is Bill  [bell rings]   we cannot have a Republican party that scapegoats anyone, Hispanics, Muslims, any women, African Americans, anyone. If that becomes the future of the Republican party, I don't want to be a part of that.
Jim Gilmore~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~You know, Martha, it may be out of the barn in that the Iranians may be moving towards a nuclear program, because this nuclear deal actually gives them a time frame up the road when they are going to be able to do that kind of program.And that's very dangerous because it means people in the Middle East have to begin to react to that right now. The United States, I think, has to continue to exercise its influence in the Middle East, stay active, and not do this pull-back type of program that we are seeing all over the place with President Obama, which is creating this kind of danger.The world is a more dangerous place now than when I was an intelligence agent. We have not only this international guerrilla war but also these challenges from these other countries as well.But, Martha, I want to say one more thing to you and Bill. I disagree with Carly Fiorina when she says that it's just a political class in Washington. The truth is that the country has changed. And there are powerful forces at this point that are really controlling our lives. And that's why people are so angry.One of those is government, which is regulating everything through the Environmental Protection Agency, through other places. But the biggest one is the organized establishment media.And I just noticed just now you gave Carly Fiorina two one-minute answers in a row. This media across the country is manipulating and shaping and framing this campaign and has been for at least a year now in order to get the kind of choices that people are going to have an opportunity to see.This is wrong. It has to change. And when I'm president, it's going to change. [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~A lot of Americans are angry. And I think it's important to understand why they are mad. They are mad because they see a government that continues to do fine. They see people at the top. They are doing fine.But that person you asked Rick about a moment ago, that lady that's making 10,000 bucks a year, do you know what our poverty programs do to people? They keep them in poverty.They keep them in poverty because we have these arbitrary thresholds  [applause]   that mean that if you go to work, you lose all the benefits for your kids, Medicaid, WIC, Section 8 housing, food stamps, and then your kids go hungry. I know a little about poverty. My sister is here tonight. Now both of us could tell you we did not grow up rich. My mother grew up in a house, oldest of seven kids. She had lived in a house that didn't have floors. Just dirt. No electricity. No running water. I resent it when people say, oh, people are poor because they want to be. No, they are not.Nobody wants to be poor. And that's a stupid, foolish thing, mean thing to say. People are poor because they don't know how to get out of the hole. And government shouldn't push them back in the hole which is what our policies do when they punish people who want to go to work and don't let them out. [applause] We can fix that, but it takes some leadership to get it done.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~And, you know me. You gave me the largest number of votes in the history of the Iowa caucus eight years ago, and I think you did it because you trusted me, you believed that I had your best interest at heart.When I was governor I had a little plaque in my office in the Governor's office, and it simply said this. Come, let us reason together. [bell rings] I believe the next President needs to put that plaque in the oval office, and needs to lead this country by saying, "Come, let us reason together." God bless you, and thank you for your support. [applause and cheering]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~I don't think it's that the message isn't working, I think it's the message isn't getting out because the message that I have this time, Bill, it's exactly what I said eight years ago. I talked about people who are standing on their feet on factory floors, people who lift heavy things, who sweat through their clothes, they're getting gut punched. They are not having a fair shake in this economy.I talked about that eight years ago, and I'm talking about it now. I talked about the importance of preserving life, of not just saying we're going to defund Planned Parenthood, but let's do something bolder. Let's get rid of abortion once and for all by applying the Fifth, and Fourteenth amendment to every person from conception because that means that we recognize that no person can be deprived of life or liberty unless they have due process. And, that's not happening in our country.And, I believe, and continue to practice that we need the Fair Tax to revive our economy. To make it so that people are able to be rewarded for their work rather than punished for it. [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~I honestly don't understand how anybody with IQ above plant life would honestly think  [laughter]   that we would be better off if we let the government have all of the private property and that the government would dole out what they thought we should have. I'm not "feeling the Bern," Bill. I'm not feeling it. [applause] And when Bernie Sanders promises these kids free college, I'm telling them, because I get asked, what about free college? I said, look, if we give you free college when you are 20, pal, you are going to be paying for it when you are 30, when you are 40, and when you are 50. [applause] There is no such thing as the government giving you anything. They will definitely make a mess of it. And I just think there are a lot of people who have never understood the basic understanding of economics, that you do not make people rich by tearing down those who are you providing jobs, and you don't help poor people by taking away.You give them jobs. Let them work. Let them earn. And then you let them keep the money that they earned. That's how we build a great economy. [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~No, I don't think that it's impossible, but we're not going to do it by doing the same things we've been doing for all these many years. And, we've lost five million manufacturing jobs just since the year 2000.The other day I was in Newton, Iowa. It used to be a vibrant place where Maytag washers and dryers were built. Went out of business in 2007, all those shops went to Mexico. All those people lost their jobs. There was a guy in my forum that day, he lost his job. He still has never found an employment that got anywhere near the job that he had.Let me ask you, how many people do you think living around the Beltway know a guy like that? Care about a guy like that? Not many. And, that's because they're six of the ten richest counties in America that surround Washington D.C. People who live in the bubbles of the high finance world of New York, the government world of Washington, the entertainment world of Hollywood, don't have a clue about how hard people out here in Iowa are working every single day.And, I believe one of the values of campaigning in Iowa, you can't win unless you go out and talk to farmers and housewives -- and welders, and unemployed truck drivers, and I hate  [bell rings]   That a president could become president who never met people who have to struggle to make a living and put food on the table. [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, I didn't have a tax and spend approach. You got to understand where the Club for Growth comes from, a bunch of rich guys sitting around writing checks to go after people they don't like. And, they don't like me sometimes because I was fighting for the guys at the bottom, not just the guys at the top. I cut 94 taxes in a state that had never had a general major tax decrease in its history.I also was able to see per capita income growth in my state go up by 50%. I think that's a pretty darn good record. Look at the overall record and it was fine.But, it's not about stats from when I was governor. Look, one of the reasons I support the Fairtax is because it's the one thing, Bill, that would truly empower people at the bottom of the economy by no longer punishing them for their work. If a guy works an hourly job, and he works eight hours, gets paid for it, terrific. But, if he works 16 hours, he doesn't get a double paycheck because he's going to be bumped up into a new tax bracket, and the government will get more of his second shift than he will. So, we've actually punished him for being industrious, hardworking, and that is a foolish economic policy  [bell rings]   that's hurting Americans about as much as anything. [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, I don't trust him. I've never said I trusted him. But if somebody is willing to take a shot at the people we are taking shots at, I'm more than willing to let them use their own bullets to do it.But let's be very clear about how we take out ISIS. And I think Rick Santorum is exactly right. You take away their land.But one of the things we have to do is a comprehensive strategy to get ISIS. First of all, take away their access to social media platforms. They are using the same social media platforms to recruit, and to train, and to direct people as I use to see pictures of my grandkids. That's ridiculous.The second thing, go after them financially. Wage war with them. Make it so nobody can do commerce with ISIS. Not a nickel of transfer. Any company, any country, that even gets close to dealing with them, absolutely put sanctions on them. Make them pay.And finally, you have got to go after them militarily. And that means we send the land, the sea, the air forces, the A-10 Warthogs dropping ordnances on every truck and every tank, and we obliterate them. But we have to understand that they are a force that's getting bigger. And with any kind of cancer, you don't contain it, you eradicate it. And that's how we have to fight ISIS, comprehensively. That's what I would suggest we do. [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, this week there was a little dust up about a video we put together with the music of Adele, so I thought it'd be appropriate for me to begin tonight by saying, "Hello, Iowa. It's me."
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~You know, I -- I would leave that to other people. I'm not going to get into an argument with all the New Yorkers, because there's a lot of them. [laughter]This much I will tell you. I wish that some of those New Yorkers had funded as much of my campaign as they did the corporately funded candidates, but they didn't.And to be honest with you, when I say I'm -- wish they had, I'm glad they didn't. I'm not a New York-funded campaign. I'm not bankrolled by the corporatists, I'm not bankrolled by Goldman Sachs and Citibank and AIG and all the big brokers -- brokerage houses and the billionaires.I'm sponsored by people like Thomas, a part-time Uber driver in Pennsylvania who sent me $25 this week. He's between jobs. He's driving an Uber car. But he believed in what I'm talking about enough that, even on a limited, part-time income, he sent me $25 to help in my campaign.I'll stand with the Thomases of the world any day. I'll leave all the discussion of the big financiers to other candidates. But there's only a few of us in the entire Republican process who are not corporately funded by the same group.And let me just finish by saying, you want to know why things never change depending on whether Democrats or Republicans are in power, and why Republicans in Iowa and the rest of the country are so frustrated?The reason is, is because if you follow the money, the same folks who finance the Democrats finance the Republicans, and no matter what the speeches and the ads, they get the same results.If you want a different result, I'm available. [applause]
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~And we are not hearing any of those things. We are hearing about whether someone is going to show up for the next debate or not.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~But, who will fight for what you believe in, and I hope you do
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~I just want to thank the people of Iowa. Over the last five years I've done 700 speeches and town hall meetings all throughout the state of Iowa, and it has been an incredible right. Thank you. [applause]I want to thank all the wonderful folks like Pastor Carey Gordon who gave me a smooth stone and said you go slay Goliaths. Someone like Jim and Janet Cook who over this past Christmas gave up Christmas presents for their kids, and they have more than I do, just they can help me and my campaign. That's the kind of people  [bell rings]   in Iowa. And, here's what I'm asking you to do. You're good people. You know good leaders. Lead. Pick the right person, not what the polls say. Not who the money give people to. Pick the leader you know is best for this country. Thank you. [applause and cheering]
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Thank you for the question, Martha.We have to have an honest discussion with the American people about the nature of the threat that we confront. This president says that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam, and as a result has put together a strategy that doesn't take care of what the reality is, which is ISIS has established a caliphate.A caliphate is like a kingdom ruled by -- a caliphate is ruled by a caliph, a kingdom is ruled by a king. Only the difference is a caliphate is also a religious title, and it is both a religious call to help this state, as well a -- to -- to make the state stronger.The reality is that ISIS has established a caliphate, and is using that to attract people around the globe to follow them as the leaders of the Sunni world.And you say, "well, how do we stop them from following them?" Well, to be a legitimate caliphate, you have to control land and operate a state under sharia law. If you don't do that, you cannot call for that support. And so the answer is we must take their land and make them  [bell rings]   illegitimate in the eyes of the Muslim world. So I would put troops on the ground and take the land back from Iraq and return to its rightful ownership in Iraq. That would delegitimize them.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~The president of the United States has been the most divisive president in -- certainly in my lifetime. This is a man who constantly  [applause] He is not trustworthy. You can't sit down and negotiate with him. He won't keep a deal. We have heard that over and over again. And here is what he does that really, really creates the friction in Washington. He personally attacks people. He ascribes motives to them that aren't true and then he tears them down. How are you going to work with someone if you don't treat them decently, honestly, and respectfully?I was a tough fighter when I was in Washington. I had very sharp elbows. I fought. I went there and joined a game named Jim Nussle here from Iowa with the "gang of seven." And we, in four years' time, took a Congress that had been controlled by Democrats for 40 years, and brought in the first Republican majority because we fought and we fought tough.But you know what? I was able to then work with those same people that we fought with and able to pass welfare reform. Unborn Victims of Violence Act. Pro-life bills. Health savings accounts.A whole laundry list of things not because I was mean, but because I was able to be respectful in the disagreements. And that's what we need in Washington, someone who can be respectful and still unite this country. [applause]
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, I've been to the March for Life for about 25 years and I thought -- I think that's a pretty good record. [applause] Spoken at it a few times and I have shepherded every single piece of pro-life piece of legislation that's passed over the last 20 years. I've either authored it or shepherded it through the United States Congress and I'm pretty proud of that record too. [applause] But we have an election going on and there was some snow coming. So I decided that maybe it would be better for me to get out and do some campaigning and not be stuck as my wife and kids were for a week, piling out of two and a half feet of snow. So, here's what I would say. If you want someone that is going to talk a good game, there are a lot of folks on this stage that have talked a good game on the issue of life.Not only have I talked a good game on life and I've done some things. But I've also lived it. You know, one of the things Saint Francis said was, you know, if you preach the gospel, then if you have to, speak.The bottom line is, that twice in my life, we were counseled to have an abortion, one with our son Gabriel and one with our little girl Bella. And neither time did Karen and I for a moment think about it because we know that life begins at conception.We know the dignity of every human life and we know the potential of every child, no matter how long that life lives. And that is a message that can come across to all Americans and without having to say a word and defend the institution of life and the dignity of life in this country. [applause]
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, in fact, the plan that I put forward is scored by the Tax Foundation as bringing three and a half million jobs into this country, and we have provisions in the flat tax for the corporate side that actually has a phase in of manufacturing. Manufacturers initially don't pay any income tax. Ten percent the next year, and 20.We're going to also have a repatriation provision which says that if you have money overseas, and you're Apple, and you got a couple hundred billion dollars there, bring it back. The most you'll be taxed 10%, invest it here in America. Create jobs here in America with all that money that's sitting overseas.We also -- it's not just taxes. It's regulation. I've pledged to cut every single Obamacare -- I mean, excuse me, Obama regulation, including Obamacare, and remove those regulations that cost more than a hundred million dollars in the economy. That will liberate -- and that includes waters of the U.S., and the ozone regulations, they -- the mercury regulations. All of these just crush our manufactures and don't create an opportunity for us to survive.And, remember, China produces five times as much CO2 and other pollutants per dollar of GDP as we do. [bell rings] You want to help the environment? Bring jobs back to America. [applause]
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, look. The entire lead up to this debate was talking about whether Donald Trump is going to show up for the next debate. The people of Iowa, who I know pretty darn well, care a lot about the issues. They care about who is going to be the leader of the free world. Who is going to be able to take on ISIS and take on Iran and make sure that we're safe. They're concerned about whether  [applause]  their agriculture programs so their renewable fuel standard is going to be retained. [bell rings]
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~What I would say is that we have to create jobs that give people wages and benefits that can help them provide for themselves and their families. And that's why I announced from a factory floor in western Pennsylvania, I pledge to make America the number one manufacturing nation, again, in the world. And we can do it. China is starting to reorient itself away from a manufacturing economy that's dumping products on the -- overseas to providing more services to their people.This is an opportunity for America. It's an opportunity for us to get those jobs back. And by the way, do you want to solve global climate change? Take 2 million jobs from China in manufacturing and moving them back here to the United States, where we produce one-fifth the CO2 when we make things. [applause]We can help -- we can do every -- we can do it all. We can take care of the environment. We can create more jobs here. Seventy-four percent of Americans don't have a college degree.And unfortunately most folks who, in the Republican Party, don't talk about what we're going to do to create jobs for people who feel like neither political party cares about them. [bell rings]When you elect me, we'll create opportunities for working men and women in this country -- all over this country.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Yes, I am.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~You know, listening to what your network was talking about prior to this race, this debate, reminded me of the coverage that many on this floor are getting. This race, this debate, was called the, "Undercard Debate". The undercard debate.It wasn't advertised significantly. In fact, the entire hour lead up to this there was no conversation about any of the four people on this debate stage, and that is the chronic situation.In fact, they listed -- they put a poll up from Wall Street Journal/NBC News, they listed the candidates, and they failed to mention I wasn't listed. I got zero, why? Because they -- NBC, Wall Street Journal poll never includes my name on the list. This is what the media has been doing over the past year, and trying to segregate, and take Iowans out of the process. What Iowans deserve  [applause]   is to hear from every candidate on equal footing. Had they applied the same rules four years ago, I would have been in the undercard debate. The guy who won the Iowa Caucuses would have been in the undercard debate, not talked about. [bell rings] We would have been talking about, maybe, an entertainer that may have been trying to run. Ladies and gentlemen, you have a chance on Monday to put the record straight about who you want, not who will entertain you.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~You know, this, again, more of the politics of trying to get people to throw stuff at each other. I'm not going to throw mud at anybody on this stage tonight. I'm not going to throw mud at anybody on the stage later. [applause] I'm not going to attack Donald Trump. What I'm -- Mike Huckabee and I were asked to come to an event where money was going to be raise to do help our veterans. You know, I thought about it. [applause] And I thought about. I said well, wait a minute, now, if there were no political considerations and I had some time because I'm not doing anything at 9:00 tonight. [laughter] And so if I had some time, would I go  [bell rings]   if I could help raise money for veterans? And the answer was yes, I would. And so I'm going. [applause]
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Absolutely. It's one of many absurd things this President has said.To target a religion and say that regardless of whether you're an American soldier who has fought on our side or allies we have overseas, simply because of your religion we're going to ban you is un-American, it is unconstitutional and it is wrong. And by the way, Wolf, now there was a group that tried to do that 150 to 160 years ago, they were called the Know-Nothing Party. They wanted to ban Catholics. They thought they were going to destroy America.Well, Donald Trump is the Know-Nothing candidate of the 21st century and cannot be our nominee.By the way, though. I fault Hillary and Obama as well because by not distinguishing between Muslims and radicalized Jihadists, by refusing to acknowledge that it's radical Muslim, radical Islamists who are carrying out these attacks against America &mdash; they let Americans who are confused and angry lump everyone together. We have to embrace the Muslims who embrace our freedom and living and safety. We have to destroy those who embrace Jihad and want to engage in violence against us here or abroad.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Ah.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~And just one more thing, Wolf. When that murderer came from Pakistan to San Bernardino and committed those atrocious crimes just a few weeks ago, she applied for a visa.She had posted on social media jihadist messages. Because this administration is so politically correct, they have a rule that they cannot look at social media postings of people applying to come to the United States.That is utterly absurd. One of the things we must do, the next president must do is get rid of that law and make sure we do everything in our power to find out if someone poses a threat to our existence here. [applause]
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~And that &mdash; but that was involved in combat, where they were actually involved in a war against each other and exchanged prisoners. We have not been in a war with Iran. They have taken civilians as hostages. It's a totally different situation. And we cannot encourage them to do any more of that.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I'm not sure &mdash; ally with which groups? I didn't quite catch that.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I could create
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I would create the no-fly zone, and let me tell you, something very simply. Putin is a bully, and the most important and effective thing you can do to a bully is punch him in the face. Create a no-fly zone.If Russian planes violate that space, either us, or the Turks, should shoot them down to keep our word. And, I guarantee you that Putin would back off. Bullies, when you stand up to them, back down.We have had, under Obama, and under Hillary as Secretary of State, nothing but weakness in the face of Russia, whether it was in the Crimea, whether it was in Ukraine, or now in the Middle East. I would give the Ukrainians lethal weapons so they could defend themselves. I would create the no-fly zone, and if Russian planes flew into it in violation of what we have declared, yes.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I would pass a law requiring them to do that. Let me just give you one example. I mentioned in Garland, Texas, where that murderer, that terrorist, the day before sent 109 messages overseas to a known terrorist.But they were encrypted. So to this date we don't know what that said. Companies are entitled to encrypt and protect their knowledge and their intelligence. But what we need is a back door for law enforcement to be able, when they can establish that that communication poses a risk to our safety and engages in terrorism, to get a court order and go in and access those communications.Allow the companies to continue encryption, provide an entry way for law enforcement when they can prove to a court that there is a sufficient risk of an attack upon us that they have the right to look at those messages.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~It's not.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~No, I completely disagree with Rick. This is America. And we've made enormous progress. And I don't care if you're a man or a woman. I care if you're good and capable of doing the job. If you can do the job &mdash; don't lower standards, don't lower the criteria &mdash; but if a woman is capable of doing these jobs, there is no reason why we should deny a patriot who wants to serve and help defend our country that right.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~No, you said you would reverse the policy which excluded women from those jobs whether or not they were able to do that. That is wrong.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Not at all. Iran is our enemy. They are the number one sponsor of state terror. The Iranian Deal is a disaster. And by the way, I don't think the next president has to aggregate it. It was never ratified by the Iranians. They have tested long-range ballistic missiles in violation of U.N. resolutions. They have broken the agreement. It is void. They can never have a nuclear weapon and should not get relief.With respect to the other groups, like Hezbollah, of course we should not work with them. I'll tell you who we should work with in Syria. There are two groups. One are the PYD, the &mdash; the Kurds in Syria who led the defense of Kobani, and are in northern and eastern Syria and anti-ISIS and anti-Assad.The second thing I'd do is three years ago, Turkey called for a no-fly zone along the Turkish border. Obama said no. We need to work with the Turks, create that no-fly zone so that Syrian refugees don't have to flock to Europe or try to get to the United States. They will have a safe haven. Anti-Assad Syrians can group there, train, organize there and let them fight the fight to protect our allies.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Of course he's innocent until proven guilty. I happen to believe he's guilty. The military did a very clear and long study as to whether or not he deserted in the face of enemy and they are not court marshalling him. I don't think he should executed. I do think he will have a fair military trial, not a civilian trial, at which time, assuming he's found guilty as I think he would, he will be sentenced appropriately.But there's a bigger issue here, this administration has failed to protect us because they have treated radical Islamists as Americans who should be tried in civil court. That is ridiculous. They are enemy aliens engaged in terror against Americans. And by the way, the fact that this president is now threatening to close Guantanamo Bay when we know that time after time, terrorists he released are involved in a high level capacity helping ISIS and Al Queda, this is a disgrace.Ask Hilary Clinton, would she keep Guantanamo Bay open so that Americans can be safe and terrorists kept from going back to the battlefield?
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Thank you, Wolf.I want to speak to you this evening not as a Republican or a presidential candidate, but as an American. As we saw today in L.A., we are at a crisis in our country. Radical Islam poses a threat to our safety not just overseas, but literally in every community in America.And yet at a time when we should be united, we have a president who has divided us, who refuses to call radical Islam what it is, let alone have a coherent strategy to defeat it.The leading Democrat, Hillary Clinton, won't call ISIS by its name, failed as secretary of state, and has continually lied to the American people.On the other hand, the leading Republican candidate, Donald Trump, continually demonizes and demeans millions of Americans, and when confronted about it, laughs it off. Neither is fit to be president of the United States.Our party, as Republicans, needs to nominate a strong leader who will unite us as Republicans, but more importantly, unite us as Americans, committed to destroying and defeating radical Islam, restoring our confidence in our safety right here, and our belief in freedom, and that the best of America is ahead of us.Thank you very much. [applause]
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Thank you. This debate has been about terrorism and appropriately so. I'm proud to have been governor of New York on September 11th and have led our state through and during the aftermath of that horrible attack.I vowed then that if I ever had the chance to lead this country, I would do everything in my power to make sure that Americans were safe. But I also saw a positive from that. New Yorkers and the American people came together and vowed that we weren't just going to defend ourselves.We were not going to live in fear. We were going to rise to new heights and celebrate our freedom.Come to Lower Manhattan today. You will see a magnificent tribute to those who died, the memorial and the museum. You will also see a new tower soaring 1,776 feet tall, the Freedom Tower, a symbol of our freedom, a symbol of our belief that as a free people we can soar to new heights.Give us the chance to unite Americans, not just Republicans. And this country's future is unlimited. [applause]
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~We have got to do far better.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Wolf, I think the answer is we have to send troops with allies and supporters. Wherever it is necessary to destroy the training centers, recruitment centers, planning hubs of ISIS.Two points though. First of all today, Saudi Arabia announced a coalition of 34 states, mostly Arab, but other Muslim states to engage actively in a war against radical Islam. We have to work with them. Not just step back. Let them take the lead but work with them to destroy ISIS.And the second point, Wolf, I want to make, is this is on the armed forces network. And thank you for doing that. Because I'm sure watching this debate this evening are some of our soldiers deployed all over the world. As the proud father of a son who was a Marine officer in Iraq and another son that was a 10th Mountain Division officer in Afghanistan, I know we produce no finer people than the men and women who put on their uniform to defend our freedom. They are watching overseas now.God bless you. This isn't about us. This is about you. Thank you for your service.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Yes, I think what Rick said is very different from what he said initially which was that, "he would reverse the policy that gave woman not the right but the opportunity to serve in combat." They can only do it if they're fit and capable and meet the same standards as men. And so, to reverse that policy and deny a woman who is prepared to risk her life to defend our freedom and is capable of doing everything a man could do is not the right thing for America in the 21st century.By the way, you see in Iraq, the Peshmerga, the Kurds ,many of their top fighters are women. This is the 21st century. We're not radical Islam. We want to give women the opportunity to do whatever they are capable of achieving in this country.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Yes, Wolf.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Yes.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~You know, again, it comes down to something that, as Mike said, breaks your heart. We clearly want to get them back. But the idea that by taking a journalist, for example, and holding him hostage in Iran, they're going to be able to get some of their terrorist leaders back, is simply bad policy.Israel has shown the way on this in rejecting hostage exchanges such as this and then not paying ransom.But, by the way, Mike is absolutely right. We have to do more to protect our people overseas, but then we also have to do more to help our veterans when they come back here today.We haven't talked about that. But more talking about defeating terrorism, one of the things we have to do is give our veterans the support and help that they require. What has happened at the VA is a disgrace.Give our veterans a medical card that they can use to get the best quality care anywhere, including outside of the VA system. [applause]
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~You know, I don't think it's a function of years of going after ISIS. They are out in the open and in cities like, Mosul, where we know they have their centers. They have centers that we could bomb. And what we have to do though, is have a commitment from our government, not just for troops on the ground but to do whatever we can to help our allies on the grounds right now,.The Kurds, the Peshmurga are fighting. If we don't give them the equipment, the training, and the support they need because our government insists that it all go through Baghdad. Baghdad doesn't want a strong independent Kurdish army.There are right now Sunni, Sheikh, and Tribes in the Anbar province, taking on ISIS. In fact, they're in the process of reclaiming Ramadi, the provincial capital this week. They are on our side and they are Sunni, but we are not arming, supporting, training, and helping them as much as we can because all support goes through Baghdad and they don't want a strong autonomous Sunni area.We have to put our interests first. Not the interests of Baghdad or of Iran, we have to support those on the ground fighting on our side. Give them every bit of help that they want and to the extent that it's necessary, for us to send in Special Ops to destroy those training centers, recruitment hubs, planning hubs, social media centers.Do that. Destroy them. Protect our freedom and get out.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~You know, I don't want to see us occupy a country. I've been to Iraq a couple of times and Afghanistan. The first time I went, I had an uneasy feeling that when we went there we were liberators. But as we stayed ,we became occupiers.I saw American troops move into some of Saddam's old hideous marble palaces. And I thought that was exactly the wrong message. We do not have to occupy. We do not have to nation build and try to create a democracy where one hasn't existed. WE have to destroy ISIS, protect our safety and our freedom here, and then get out.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~You know, I think it's very important that we do everything in our power to prevent radicalization of Americans right here. And it is happening, not just overseas, but it's happening here from Mosques on social media.And truth &mdash; interaction and community meetings.New York police department had a very active group, aggressively monitoring and using intelligence to &mdash; in certain Muslim communities, consistent with our constitution, consistent of our civil rights, so they could have the intelligence as to where these sermons are being given, and who is being radicalized. And, they stopped and prevented dozens, and dozens of attacks in New York.You know, I'm a great believer in the First Amendment, of Freedom of Speech. I wish we had more of it on our college campuses, but you can't shout fire in a crowded theater. Calling on Americans to engage in violence against their fellow Americans in the name of jihad is crying fire in a crowded theater. It is not constitutionally protected speech, it should be shut down.And, by the way, the two murders who went to Garland, Texas to massacre many Americans before the Texas police officer courageously killed them, had been radicalized here.Getting to that metadata question, one of those terrorists, the day before the attacks, had sent [bell rings] 109 message to a known terrorist overseas. We could not read those messages, we can not read those today
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~You know, I think what I said earlier is that I would create a no-fly zone in Syria. Turkey just agreed to take 3 million more Syrian refugees. The EU just came up with a funding program to provide camps for Syrian refugees, but I would also create that no-fly zone where refugees can be there.I have to say I agree with Rick, because this President is talking about taking 10,000 people from Syria, who we cannot vet. This administration, allegedly, vetted the woman who carried out the attacks in San Bernardino and never found out that she had a false address and was on social media talking about radical Jihad.Coming from Syria, it's impossible to do that check. And we know, by the way, that ISIS is using this refugee program to send terrorists to the West to engage in attacks. They have said that. That this is an opportunity for them to do that.So, the answer is no. No Syrian refugees. Whether it's the 10,000 Obama wants or the 60,000 that Hillary Clinton wants. Think about it, I was governor on September 11th. Those attacks were carried out by only 18 people. We take 60,000 Syrian refugees that we can't vet. If one in 1,000, 1 in 1,000 is a terrorist, we would have 60 terrorists living amongst us looking to carry out attacks. We cannot let that happen.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~and we're going to go on the offense and they're ready to go.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~And, I am that guy.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~But, the reason they don't partner with Obama is they just don't trust him. Do you think they would trust me? I know them all. I've been working for a decade to figure out how to win this war.To my good friend Ted Cruz, please ask him the following question, you say you would keep Assad in power, I will tell you that is the worst possible thing that could come out of an American leaders mouth. It would be disastrous. His favorite movie is, apparently, Princess Bride. Ted, getting in bed with Iran and Russia to save Assad is inconceivable. [applause]
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Can I say something?
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Can, can I
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Don't belittle their sacrifice.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I didn't get to say yes. Yes.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I don't think it's necessary. If you don't want to be there, I don't want you to be there. I just retired after 33 years in the Air Force, 140 days on the ground as an Air Force Reservist. To those who are watching, thank you for your service.I've had a small walk in your shoes. We have the best military in the world. Obama has put it in a box. Let's take it out of the box and use it before we get attacked here. We don't need a draft, we need a commander in chief who knows what the hell they're doing. [applause]
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I think we need to have a military strategy regarding Libya. They've just take over Gaddafi's hometown called Sur. There's about 2000 of them.Here's what I've learned in my 36 visits, you can't deter these guys, they're ready to die, bring on the virgins. Dying is first place in their world. What we have to do is work with others over time to destroy to ideology. We have to offer a hopeful life to compete with the glory of this.Most young people folks want the same thing you do. They don't want to live in the 11th century. So yes, you have to destroy the caliphate. I want to work with Arabs and Turkey to do it, but here's the key is to not leave. If we left Germany and Japan only god knows what would've happened. If we have 10000 troops left in Iraq, there would be no ISIL and I hate what Obama did. He gave away everything we fought for and I hate what he did.I begged him not to and I've been right more than I've been wrong.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I want to talk to General Keane first. I want to find out, what do we need militarily to keep them contained and eventually destroy them in Libya. They're in nine countries. You want to deal with Libya, go to Iraq and Syria. You want to prevent another 9/11, take the caliphate headquarters away from ISIL. There is no other way to do it without a ground force going into Syria. We have to be part of that ground force, or another 9/11 is coming just as sure as I'm standing here. They're planning it tonight.The ISIL leadership wants to hurt you, and your family, and if I'm president, they will not get here 'cause we're going to kill 'em over them.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I will support the Republican nominee, whoever he or she may be. Like Bob Dole, I may sleep late that day if it's Trump. But the bottom line, if it's Trump, so be it. That's who I'll support. Please understand we're in a war that we can't afford to lose, and what he said about banning Muslims coming here to America has made us all less safe, and it's the worst possible thing he could do in this war. He clearly doesn't understand this war and how to win it. For God's sakes, pick somebody who is worthy of the sacrifice of those who are fighting this war and who actually knows how to win, and I don't believe that's Mr. Trump, and I know it's not Hillary Clinton.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I would &mdash; make changes to that bill in light of what I know today.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~No.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~No. What I would do is I would try to make friends throughout the world to destroy a common threat to the world. These people are religious Nazis. Most people in Islam don't buy what they're selling. I've told you a thousand times that I would partner with the Arabs in Turkey.But, the reason they don't partner with Obama is they just don't trust him. Do you think they would trust me? I know them all. I've been working for a decade to figure out how to win this war.To my good friend Ted Cruz, please ask him the following question, you say you would keep Assad in power, I will tell you that is the worst possible thing that could come out of an American leaders mouth. It would be disastrous. His favorite movie is, apparently, Princess Bride. Ted, getting in bed with Iran and Russia to save Assad is inconceivable. [applause]
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Princess Buttercup would not like this. [laughter]
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Rick, please understand the only way we're gonna win the war against radical Islam is for the world to unite. Very few fathers and mothers want to turn their daughters and sons over to ISIL. If you spend any time in the region, you'd know that. Muslims have died by the thousands fighting this hateful ideology. You can say what you like, but when you utter the word I will ban all Americans, all Muslims from coming to America, how do you think the king of Jordan must feel to hear that? He is our friend, he is our ally. This is not the way to make America safe. This is the way to help our enemies. Stop this before it's too late.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Thank you very much.I just returned from Iraq two weeks ago. It was my 36th trip to Iraq and Afghanistan in the last decade. Toward the end, I met a very impressive Special Forces sergeant. It was his job to train Iraqi Kurdish commandos.He was so proud of what he was doing and so proud of the people he was training. He was the replacement for Master Sergeant Wheeler, a Delta Force member who was killed two months ago in a raid against an ISIL prison to free prisoners.As I departed, I told this young man, stay safe. He replied, sir, I will do my best to stay safe, but I came here to win. As commander-in-chief, I will do everything in my power to make sure that he can win. As president, we will win. [applause]
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Thank you. This is why I own a flip phone. You don't have to worry about all of this stuff. [laughter] The bottom line is, we're at war. They're trying to come here to kill us all and it's up to the government to protect you within constitutional means. Any system that would allow a terrorist to communicate with somebody in our country and we can't find out what they're saying is stupid.If I'm president of the United States, and you join ISIL, you are going to get killed or captured. And the last thing you are going to hear if I'm president is, you've got a right to remain silent. [laughter]
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~The next president is going to be a war-time president, whether they like it or not. I'm ready for that job. Two years ago isolationism led by Senator Paul and Cruz was white hot in our party. Now it is in retreat because events have proven me more right than wrong and has proven them to be wrong.In the first debate I called for American troops on the ground to protect our homeland. Nobody came forward. Now, most have. We've spent a lot of carnage to get them to where I have always been.Make me president, I will keep you and your family safe. [applause]
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~They are ready to go. They just need to be led.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~This is important. We're not fighting all the wars with our kids. If you've been to Iraq and Afghanistan and you made any friends, you've lots of bunch. Thousands have died in Iraq and Afghanistan fighting.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~To, to those the (well) times in the Army were a bigger problem than they are today. If you want to fix this, you get the Army to 500,000, not 420,000. You want to win this war, grow the Navy to 350 ships, not 275. Sequestration is Latin for doing really dumb things. We're going to have the smallest Navy since 1915, the smallest Army since 1940. I was yelling and screaming don't do sequestration. I was right. If I am President of the United States, Commander in Chief, we're going to rebuild our military without a draft
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Two years ago.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~we'd better do something about it, and I have a plan.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well I stand unique, having been a military lawyer for 33 years. I've been a defense attorney, a prosecutor, and a military judge. Mr. Trump, you don't have to speak about everything, that's not required. [laughter]I would make sure that everybody had a fair trial. Does that make sense to you? [applause]We're at war folks and this stuff has to stop. It's bad for morale to hear somebody wanting to be Commander in Chief that would deny due process to somebody who's been charged in the military. For God's sakes Mr. Trump, you're asking to be the Commander in Chief , the leader of the free world, up your game.As to women, if you want to kill terrorists, I'm your guy.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, here's what I'm here to tell you, when I first started this process of running for president., I said, " if you didn't realize we need more America boots on the ground in Iraq and eventually in Syria as a part of the regional army - not ready to be commander in chief." Like nobody said a word, now everybody's on board except Senator Paul.Senator Paul and Senator Cruz, are isolationists. They both want to restrict the ability of the NSA to do the following; find out if somebody overseas is calling into America and if somebody is on the other end of the phone, don't you want to know who their talking to? IF a terrorist is calling into America and we can match up phone numbers we get a get a court order to find out what the content is.We're at war folks, they're not trying to steal your car, they're trying to kills us all. So yes, I would re-institute this program. There's four things you need to understand about this war, it's a religious war, them against the world, if you don't fight them over there, they're coming here. If you don't hit them first, they're going to hit us. If you're not determined to fight it as a ware, you're going to lose it.So if you're worried about somebody having your phone in the government, don't be. The only thing you need to worry about is if you're talking to terrorist and a judge gives an order to listen to what you're saying. That's all you need to worry about.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, number one, dead men don't preach anything. If you don't understand we need a ground force to go into Syria, then you're not ready to destroy ISIL. Rick, there's nobody left to train inside of Syria. Let the Arabs fight this fight, pay for this war, but they need our help.The difference between me and you and others is that I see you've got two choices. Fight them over there or they're coming here. They're planning another 9/11 as I speak. Paris was well planned. They wake up every day in Syria trying to find a way to hit us here. If I'm president, we're going in with the Arabs in Turkey and we're gonna destroy them before they hit us here. We're running out of time, folks.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, the first thing I would do is make adjustments to reality. I want to look and see if this was a terrorist arranged marriage between the couple in California. The fact that they met online accidentally is almost zero. So, no, I would have a time-out on Syrian refugees because you'd be crazy if you didn't after Paris.But, I've been to the refugee camps in Turkey, and Jordan. Trust me with your Christian &mdash; and I'm a lousy Christian saved by grace, but &mdash; this is important. We've got to stop this war. Do you realize that there are more Syrian refugees in Lebanon going to school than Lebanese children? Do you realize if this war goes for another year the King of Jordan could fall?Let's have a no-fly zone.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, what you want to do is you want to knock them off line. How about this idea? If you pledge allegiance to al-Baghdadi, you can't get married in America? The bottom line is you have to go after them everywhere. The key to winning this war is to provide the capacity to those in the faith who reject the ideology. The key to fighting this war is to fight it in their backyard, not ours. Two years ago I came up with a plan that requires more American boots on the ground in Iraq. The first thing out of my mouth running for President was, if you don't understand we need 10,000 troops in Iraq, rather than 3,500, you're not ready. What would I do in Syria? I'd form a regional army of Arabs and Turkey. Ninety percent them, 10 percent us. Up to 10,000 U.S. forces to go in on the ground and destroy the caliphate and its roots. Take Raqqah away from ISIL, kill every one of these bastards we could find. Then I would stay. I would hold the hands of those who are willing to live in peace with us. I would build small school houses in remote regions of the world to give a young woman a voice about her children, something that will end radical Islam more than the bomb. I'm all in. Whatever it takes, as long as it takes. To the isolationists in our party, you're no better than Obama. If you want to win this war, follow me. I am seeking victory, folks, not containment.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Yeah, this is an important discussion. The American president is the strongest voice in the world &mdash; until Obama came along. Now, we're just one of many. When you ask people to help you, when you entice Syrians to join your cause, to take down the dictator they hate to destroy ISIL which will attack our homeland, and you sit on the sidelines and watch the Russian president kill them, it makes it harder for us to get partners in the future.The point I'm trying to make is we got to mean what we say [bell rings] And, I am begging people to wake up to Syria. The next 9/11 is coming from Syria, it's coming soon
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Yeah. I just don't make this up, Wolf. I talk to people who are combat trained who have won in Iraq who I trust.Here's what I want to tell the Arab world and Turkey. We're not going to send 100,000 troops. You're going to do the fighting this time and we're gonna help you. We paid for the last two wars, you're gonna pay for this one.And, by the way, they get it because ISIL wants to cut their heads off, too. The point I'm trying to make is, there needs to be a ground component. We need to be smart, and we need to fight the war over there. And to the people in my party who believe you can withdraw from the battlefield like Senator Cruz and Paul and we be safe, you really don't understand this war.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Yeah. There are at least 3,500 American muslims serving in the armed forces. Thank you for your service. [applause] You are not the enemy. Your religion is not the enemy. Let me make this real to you.I was at the second presidential election in Afghanistan. The guy guarding me was an American Muslim sergeant in the Army who grew up in Kabul, left when he was &mdash; graduated high school, joined the U.S. Army, went back to his high school where they were doing polling, people voting, he took me there and cried like a baby. I cried like a baby.He is the solution to this problem, folks. He is not the problem. Leave the faith alone. Go after the radicals that kill us all. [applause]
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Yeh, it's just you're not going to win that way, Rick. There's nobody left in Syria to train. Between the Russians and Assad, they have killed all the people we trained, and our President sat on the sidelines and watched people get killed that we enticed into the fight. There is nobody left to train. I would get the Arabs who are threatened by ISIL just as much as we are, along with Turkey. We would use their armies. They have modern armies. Ninety percent them. But some of us have to go, folks. You're not going to keep the war from here if some of us don't go over there. Ninety percent them, 10 percent us, and we go in and destroy the caliphate. There must be American boots on the ground in Syria to win. If you don't understand that, you're not ready to be Commander in Chief.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Yes.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~You may think this makes us safe, but it doesn't. The good news for everybody in this room is, after 36 trips to Iraq and Afghanistan, most people over there, Wolf, are not buying what ISIL's selling. This is a religious war between radical Islam and the rest of the world. And there's only one way you're going to win this war. Help people in Islam who reject radical Islam to fight over there and destroy this ideology. Donald Trump has done the one single thing you cannot do. Declare war on Islam itself. ISIL would be dancing in the streets, they just believe in dancing. This is a coup for them, and to all of our Muslim friends throughout the world, like the King of Jordan and the President of Egypt, I am sorry. He does not represent us. If I am President, we will work together. People in the faith to all over the world destroy this radical ideology. Declaring war on the religion only helps ISIL.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~but I'm convinced
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I'd sure want them to think we would. And I'd want to make sure that we did everything we could. But we can't do it with our current Military strength. We've got to build up and have the most robust, well trained, well equipped, well prepared and ample Military force in the history of the world because we're not fighting just a known enemy in one place. We're fighting people all over the world who can go anywhere.And the reason I say that is because if we tried to win this war on the cheap or we try to do it with the, "light footprint," we're making a huge mistake.When all of us were in grade school, one thing we all knew, the bully never picked on the kid except for the weak one.When all of us were in grade school, one thing we all knew, the bully never picked on the kid, except for the weak one. He never picked on the kid he knew, he'd whip him. We need to make to sure that we have the kind of military that ISIS recognizes in every radical Islamist in the world recognizes, they may start but we by god will finish the fight. And it will be their rear ends on the ground, not ours when it's all over whether it takes ten days, ten months, or ten eternities' we're going to win this fight and have to make sure they understand that.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I'm not belittling their sacrifice, Lindsey, but I'm just making note that on the part of Americans we have sent National Guard troops over for an 18-month em &mdash; 18-month deployment. They come back for five, they go back for another 18. We're wearing these guys out. They agreed to be citizen soldiers. We turned them into full time soldiers because we've not kept up the pace by recruiting enough people in the military to fully fill these forces, and that's what we need to be doing.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I don't disagree. I don't disagree with anything that the Senator just said because that's exactly right. But, I just want to go back to the point that when people say we can't go into the mosque, we can't listen. That's utter nonsense. Of course we can. And, if we can't, if there's something so secretive going on in there that somebody isn't allowed to go and hear it, maybe we do need for sure to send somebody in there and gather the intelligence. And, that's all to the world I'm saying, I think it stands to be true.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I would make sure that there was economic pressure put on them. Why not? Why should we fund every single battle against radical Islam? Why should we stand back and watch Israel get targeted, the United States get targeted and we watch with people with their hands in their pocket, and their hands in our pocket because we're getting them a lot of money. And let's say your hands can be in your pocket, you can stand still, but your hands aren't going to be in our pockets anymore. We're not going to give you another dime unless you engage the battle with us. We are not sending our sons and daughters, and grandsons and granddaughters to war to fight for your interest. You either get in with us or be on your own. But we're not gonna fight the battle for you.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I wouldn't reinstate a draft, but, I think it's noteworthy that we are fighting all the battles we have with less than one percent of the American population.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I wouldn't reinstate a draft, but, I think it's noteworthy that we are fighting all the battles we have with less than one percent of the American population.We have the lowest level of percentage of population participating in the military than ever. And they're over-deployed, they're over used, especially among our reserves and Guard troops. Any governor will tell you.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Let me finish, Hugh. You elect him to lead which means that if you think it's a good idea to not punish the children for something their parents did, then you go to the members of Congress and you persuade them. And, you persuade the American people.You don't just jump up and shove it up the nostrils of Congress, and the American people because you think you have a superior intellect, and a superior will, and a superior theology than everybody else. Our system is not a system of tyranny. We don't elect kings, we elect servants.If I'm elected president, I don't consider myself to be elected to be the king of the country, but the servant of the country to work with other people who are elected to get things done that need to be done.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~No, because he did it unconstitutionally. Twenty-three times he's said he couldn't do it, and then one day he woke up and he found he had a pen in one hand, and a phone in another, and wow. That Constitution didn't mean much anymore.Look, President's can't just do what they want to do. That's the purpose of getting elected and working with other people who got elected, is that our system was designed to function with the power of persuasion, it's really what you elect a president to do.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~No, it does not violate their First Amendment rights to have someone go and listen to the sermons. You can go to any church in America, it's a public place, you can listen, and &mdash; you know, if you go to my church, you'll probably get a real blessing. Heck, it'll be a wonderful experience.You go to some people's church, you may go to sleep, I don't know what happens in every church, but, the point is that these are public places, and folks are invited to come.So, if it's a public place, and people are invited to come, how does it violate anybody's First Amendment rights that somebody shows up because they might want to just listen in and see is there something that is a little nefarious? And, if there is, then you take the second step of getting a search warrant, you do whatever you have to do. That's all protected under the constitution.So, Huge, I hear people act like there's something that is terrible about going and sitting in and listening to the sermons of a mosque. If Islam is as wonderful, and peaceful as its adherents say, shouldn't they be begging us to all come in and listen to these peaceful sermons? Shouldn't they be begging us all to come, and listen, and bring the FBI so we'd all want to convert to Islam?
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~No. I'm not taking it away, I just want to make sure that everything we use is going to be effective. We're spending billions of dollars, let's make sure it's effective. Let's use every tool, but let's also check out the Facebook posts, let's look at Twitter accounts.My gosh, we were told we couldn't do it because it might invade somebody's privacy. This lady who came over here and shot up San Bernardino was posting things on Facebook, yet, we were restricted from looking. Every college kid who goes to a frat party gets drunk and puts his picture on Facebook is going to have a potential employer looking at that photo before he gets hired.Why should we have more attention? I mean, for heaven's sake, towards some college kid who wants to one day ten years from to get a job, then we're going after who wants to come in with a semi automatic weapon or a pipe bomb and blow up a bunch of Americans. This is what I think a lot of Americans are frustrated with, it's the duplicity of our policy that is illogical and irrational.Our goal ought to be, "protect Americans and put Americans first not last," which is what I think this administration has done.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~The horrors that those families have to go through, if that were my son, my daughter, I'd give my last drop of blood to get them back. You bet I would. Is it a good policy? No.It's a terrible policy because once we do it, we're only going to invite more and more hostages, more and more ransoms, and the diasters gets even worse. But I don't blame any of these families. You know who I blame? I blame a policy in our government that has made it so that families are so desperate that they're willing to pay ransom to terrorists organizations because they don't believe our government will fight the fight for them and they think they're out there on their own.My goodness people, this is America. When did we have to start telling people that you've got to bake your own bread in order to fight the battles? That's what we have a government for, it's what we pay taxes for. And I believe, those families ought to have a better expectation of what this government will do.We should never has sat at the table with the Iranians as long Sayed Abadnini is sitting in an Iranian prison. As long as the Washington Post report is over there. Until the four hostages of America were on an airplane safely out of Tehran. We should've told them, " we won't even walk into the room with you much less sit down and negotiate with you."That's what we ought to be doing. [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~The terrorists don't win just because they kill us. The terrorists win when they make us change everything we do in our daily lives and alter our routines. And they're doing that, from getting on a plane to going in a building.And it is high time that we recognize that we have to take them out, not a little bit, but totally, because I want my grandkids to grow up not in fear, but in faith and in freedom.And if you give me the opportunity to be president of the United States, I will fight for your grandkids as much as I will for mine.Thank you and God bless you. [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~The way we defeat them ideologically is that we remind people that what their intent is is to kill us, and that it is our intent to use every means possible to get to them before they get to us.We are pretending that this is a war that is not that significant. We have a president who called it the JV team, said we had contained it. Nine hours after he said we contained it, there was a massacre in Paris.We've got to make it so untenable for somebody to join ISIS. Rather than making it so that teenagers from around the world want to go and be to be a part of this, we need to go after it with significant ground troops, air campaign.The president boasted we had 9,000 flown sorties, air missions over 18 months. What he failed to tell the American people, we were flying 3,000 air missions per day during Desert Storm.And the rules of engagement have got to be loosened, because we have to make sure that we are not just going over and setting off some fireworks. We have to kill some terrorists and kill every one of them we can to make it very clear that to take action or threaten action against the United States, and you've just signed your death warrant.We're coming to get you. And you won't be coming to our shores. You're going to be going to your funeral. That's what we need to do to begin to defeat it ideologically.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~We just need to take a real pause and all the people that coming here and we don't know who they are or what their affiliations are. What George just said is right. We can't take the risk. And why should we take the risk?And if it's such a doggone good idea to bring people here that we really don't know who they are and Obama thinks that we're being un-Christian to not do it, I've got a suggestion. Let's send the first wave of them to Chappaqua, Martha's Vineyard and the upper east side of Manhattan and to the south lawn of the White House where we'll set up a camp.Let's see how that works out. And if they behave wonderfully, that's fine. I want to say, I don't want someone lecturing me about what it means to be a Christian that I should invite a potential terrorist into my backyard. On one hand, the left says separation of church and state. Let's not have any discussion of religion, and then the left wants to tell me what it means to be a Christian. They need to figure out if they know more about being a Christian than I do, then tell me On one hand, the left says separation of church and state. Let's not have any discussion of religion, and then the left wants to tell me what it means to be a Christian. They need to figure out if they know more about being a Christian than I do &mdash; then tell me. They are no longer going to say separation of church and state, but, we have the most fundamental right above everything else &mdash; is not to protect the reputation of Islam. It is to protect Americans first and foremost. That is our job. [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well what we have done, and we created an impossible atmosphere. This administration has put more pressure on Israel to stop building bedrooms in Judea and Samaria than they've put on Iranians to stop building a nuclear bomb. And I'm just simply pointing out the obvious, that we need to recognize who our friends are, who our enemies are
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, first of all, it would be the Iranians. I would have never entered into this deal. I don't know why on God's earth that the senators gave it so that it was easier for Obama to have the agreement than it would be to make it a treaty.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, I want to be real clear, I don't trust Putin, I don't trust Assad. I'm not saying that I would endorse him for his reelection bid. The man is a tyrant, he's killed lots of people, but he wasn't killing Americans. And, the thing that I'm concerned about is that we have seen a complete destabilization, not only of Syria, but we've seen it in Yemen, that the President pronouncing great shape just before it collapsed.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, I would say that, if you want a college education, let's go back and reinstate the full-blown G.I. bill. You give something to your country; your country gives something back to you. We need to ask young people to step up and buy their own freedom because there's not going to be enough people left at less than one percent. And as my good friend Ken Howard, former Dean of the War College, has often said, we're fighting all the wars with other people's kids. And that's one of the things that's making us much less safe, is because we don't have enough Americans truly invested in the process of defeating our enemies. Therefore, I do think without a draft we do need to ask people to recognize we are at war.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, let me begin by saying I'm not that afraid of Donald Trump. And, in the sense that I'd rather him be President than I had Hillary be president any day. And so if he becomes president, I think he will do a whole lot more to protect us than Hillary will. And a whole lot more than Barack Obama has done in his eight years.So I want to make it very clear that when I was making that comment, I was simply speaking that I'm not sure that you can have a religious test per se. And it's very impractical because if somebody comes to our borders and says I'd like to come in. They say are you a Muslim? Well, they're &mdash; if they're going to come in here to kill us, they're not gonna say yeah, and I'm coming to kill you. They're going to lie about it. Anybody that will kill you, for God's sake, will lie to you.So that's why I say it's impractical. But what he has done, and I don't think a lot of people understand, he has touched a nerve because people are angry and afraid that we are facing an enemy that this administration refuses to acknowledge, refuses to want to go fight. And our only answer is to go after ISIS and to go after every form of radical Islam where they are, take them down, so they never get here and do what they did in San Bernardino again ever.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Wolf, I want to say thanks to you and CNN for giving us the opportunity especially to focus on national security issues at a time when Americans are not only angry &mdash; angry at their government that they feel like has failed them, been indifferent to them, cost them their livelihoods &mdash; but they're in addition to angry, they're just plain scared. They're scared when they thing that they go to a Christmas party and get shot at by somebody who sat and had lunch with them an hour earlier. They're scared when they realize that our government, who promises that it can vet people and is begging us to approve bringing 10,000 Syrian refugees into this country, can't even catch somebody after a third background check, who had posted things on social media clearly indicating she wanted to kill Americans. And we couldn't catch that. We've lost confidence in our government. And when Americans lose confidence in their government, we're in a dangerous place. We're in danger because we have an enemy that is out to kill us, and we have a government that we don't trust any more. This election is about going back to having a government we can trust with leaders who have the courage and conviction to actually lead and not follow.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Wolf, it may be sufficient, but rather than put a number &mdash; and I'm comfortable that we say 10,000, 20,000 &mdash; look, I think we make a mistake when we start telling the enemy what our limitations are. I think we make a huge mistake when we say we're gonna do up to this. I think what we say is, we're gonna do whatever it takes. If it's 10,000, if it's 100,000, if it's 3,000 sorties a day, if it's 5,000 sorties a day.We never tell our enemy what our limitations are, what we are willing and what we're unwilling to do. And that's one of the mistakes I believe that we're making militarily. But the biggest mistake we've made militarily is letting Barack Obama cut our defense forces by 25 percent and leaving us at the least prepared position we've been in since before World War II.We have to get our Military rebuilt from the ground up. And all over America I hear young people say, would you tell me what you're going to do? Would you give me free college? Will you make sure that I can have medical marijuana?You know what we ought to tell young people? We aren't going to give you anything. We're give you the opportunity to get off your butt and go serve your country and secure your freedom. Because if you don't, nobody else is.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~And the fact that we have a nuclear treaty with the Shiites in Iran, that we have now partnered with the Russians and appearing to allow Assad to stay, which is a satellite Alawites, very interrelated to the Shiites, this looks to ISIS &mdash; and what they're selling is that we are now lining up with the Shiite world against the Sunni world.Well the Shiite world is 15 percent of the Muslim world. The Sunni world is 85 percent. We're &mdash; we're picking the wrong horse here. Not only is the Iranian deal the greatest betrayal of this &mdash; of this country in the history of our country by signing that deal, but secondly, we have now lined up to empower ISIS by partnering with the Shiites. So the answer is this. The answer is we have to take them on in Iraq, defeat them in Iraq. Delegitimize their caliphate. Join with legitimate rebel forces which exist in Syria and begin to arm them and train them. But it's a one-two step. The first step has to be Iraq.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Barack Obama has not kept this country safe. Hillary Clinton will not keep this country safe. We need to nominate someone who America knows will keep this country safe.Ten years ago I put the sanctions on Iran's nuclear program. Before that, I gave speech after speech, including to President Bush, to identify the enemy and call these radical Islamists who they are.Ladies and gentlemen, this week ISIS put out a fatwa on disabled children and killed dozens of them because of their disability. Now, I am the father of a disabled child. I know and have known the face of evil. And I, if you give me the opportunity, will defeat it. Thank you. [applause]
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~But if they cannot, I would reverse the policy. And what happened here is there were many studies done, particularly in the Marine Corps, which begged this President not to move forward with this because people are going to get killed as a result of it. The President went forward anyway.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Here's the problem. I was with, in fact, one my guests here today is the Sheriff in Cochise County, down on the border in Arizona. And, he talked with me last night when I was with him about all of the children coming across. All of the children, why?Because we've created a magnet. These children are not coming over, and in great shape, not coming over &mdash; and not in harms way, and &mdash; going through difficult times. We're attracting people.He's also the Sheriff that caught Syrian's at the border. We have through the policies supported by almost everybody in this field [bell rings] A policy that says amnesty. The world hears this, and knows that if they can come across this border, by and large, they're going to be able to stay. That has to change.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I don't think it's a war with Russia anymore than Turkey went to war with Russia when Turkey shot down a plane
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I don't. I don't think we should be able to deny someone's constitutional rights based on a list kept by the government that nobody knows how they get on it, or how they get off of it.If you're going to make that list public, if you're going to put criteria out there as to how you're going to get on it, if you're going to deny someone's constitutional right, than I think there has to be more transparency. Let's just be honest, when someone applies for a gun, you do a background check. And, if you're on the terrorist watch list, guess what very well may happen? You may get denied that.That's a discretion of the people &mdash; of the ATF in making that kind of decision. I want to leave that discretion &mdash; as long as this list is not well known, as long as it's not transparent, we have to leave that discretion.I want to make a comment about what Mike said, and George said, about mus &mdash; Islam.The fact of the matter is, Islam is different. I know this is going to come as a shock to a lot of people, and I mean the sincerely. Islam is not just a religion. It is also a political governing structure. The fact of the matter is, Islam is a religion, but it is also Sharia law, it is also a civil government, it is also a form of government. And, so, the idea that that is protected under the First Amendment is wrong.And, in fact, that political structure is what is the big problem. The imposition of Sharia law adherence to fundamental Islam as it was practiced in the Seventh Century
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I said if you can't do the job, you shouldn't be able to you shouldn't have the position.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I would agree &mdash; I would agree that Donald Trump's proposal was not the right proposal. But he brings up a very important issue that I think we've been ignoring for far too long in this country. The reality is that, yes, we need to get reformist Muslims to join us. We need to get those who are being persecuted and killed within the Middle East to join us. But we also have to protect this country from those who want to harm us and we have to defeat those who are radicalized in the Middle East and wherever we find them around the world.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I would change the policy to reflect what is the best interest of the people that we're asking. I've got a son who's going, who's going into the Air Force right now, and I, as a father, I want to make sure that, if he's out there on the front line &mdash; and he may be a pilot flying an airplane &mdash; I want to make sure that the person who's responsible for, for his wing has the ability to do the job they're doing. And if they don't have that ability to do the job, if we're doing a social promotion as opposed to what's best for the efficacy of our fighting force and for the survivability of our men and women, I'll change that policy.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I would have no problem with Sy &mdash; with boots on the ground in Syria in a training capacity. I do not want American troops on the front line in Syria because I don't believe that that would serve to the interest. Again, understanding what ISIS is preaching. You have to learn what they're telling their people. They want to draw the United States, they want to draw the great Satan into Syria, into a particular town in Syria, because it, it's consistent with their theology. And you say, well, this sounds like gobbledy gook. It's what they believe. And if we don't take seriously what they believe and how they're able to attract people, then we're going to make mistakes like invading Syria with a ground force and bringing them into the battle that they so deeply deserve and desire.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I would use the studies that were done that were ignored by this military that there were certain positions that frankly were not suitable. And they pushed a political agenda above what is in the best interest of the safety, security, and effective of our, of our fighting units. So I would go back to using what we should be doing. Which is putting forth people on those front line positions who are best prepared to do the job, survive the job, and come back home safely.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Is not &mdash; and, I'm out of time.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Just because it couldn't have prevented San Bernardino doesn't mean that we shouldn't have all tools available to us that doesn't impinge upon people's privacy. This sort of data collection is not collecting people's phones calls, their voices; they're not collecting information that's personal. There's no names attached to these numbers. They're simply numbers and times and relationships that throughout algorithms that computer technology can be able to sort through relationship about what numbers are calling what numbers and be able to track those down to see if there's any leakage's between someone who's potentially a terrorist.That is to me just fundamental that we have to have this type of data to be able to not impinge upon people's privacy. In fact, I would make the argument that the more data we can collect that's anonymous that we can through, through using algorithms, the less we need to involve people in and imposing themselves in people's privacy.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Lindsay says this is a real war, until it comes to immigration. And, then, all of a sudden it's not such a real war. The reality is that we've seen since the events of 9/11, the president talks about how he's worried about discrimination and acts against Muslims. There's four times as many acts of violence against Jews than there are against Muslims. I never hear the president talk about that. [applause]The reality is that under this president, since 9/11, this anti-Muslim United States of America has doubled the rate of Muslim immigration. Since 9/11. [bell rings]That's what we've done. So, the idea that we have an immigration system that is working
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Look, I agree with Governor Huckabee, that we should in fact be looking at people's social media posts. That's just common sense.But we've defunded and tied the hands behind the backs of our intelligence agencies because of political correctness. We're not allowed to ask any questions or really pursue, whether there's any mosque that they're attending that could be spreading Jihadism, and we know that in this country there are Imams that are doing that. But we're not allowed to ask those questions, we're not allowed to pursue to those things because we have a president who denies the reality of the enemy we confront.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~No look, I'm committed to whatever is necessary understanding the nature of the enemy. The enemy is a theocracy and their allure is their theocracy. It's their doctrine and so we have to understand that doctrine. That's why, I love the fact that people are angry and outraged in Washington and want someone new and fresh. But we need someone who understands and has knowledge and experience in these areas.And I can see that you know, Senator Graham has that experience and we have a little difference of opinion. But frankly, it's not that big of difference in our opinion, we both want to defeat ISIS. We have elements in our party that don't and I will use whatever means necessary within the confines of not crossing a tripwire theologically that could turn on us.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~No, I did not say that, George. I mean, you may, you may have heard that, but I didn't say that. What I said was, if they can in fact do the job that any, any other person can do, I will allow them to do so.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Of course I do. But what Donald Trump was saying was nothing against Muslims. His comment was against this administration who doesn't have a policy to properly vet people coming into this country. Let's just be honest about what's &mdash; what's being talked about here. And I know people will pile on because it makes sense to pile on, maybe from the polls. But he brings up a legitimate issue. The fact of the matter is not all Muslims are Jihadists and no one, including I suspect, Donald Trump would say that. But the reality is, all Jihadists are Muslims.That's a reality. And we have &mdash; we have to stop worrying about offending some people and start defending all Americans. Because we're not right now.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Of course there is a proper way to vet refugees coming into the United States. But not from the ISIS-controlled area or Syria. How can you do a background check? Where are you gonna go? Who are you going to call? Call Assad and say, hey, you know, tell me about this guy from Aleppo.There's no possibility in these &mdash; in these types of war-torn countries to adequately vet someone to allow them to come into this country. It's impossible.So you have a physical impossibility here. Secondly, we shouldn't be taking people out of that region and move them here to the United States. And the reason we shouldn't is very clear. If you talk to the clerical leaders and particularly those who are religious minorities, they don't want their people to be relocated so they're never gonna come back. And let me assure you, if they come to America, they're not going to come back. They're not gonna go back to those areas. So who stays? Those who cooperated with ISIS and maybe a few of the refugees who's come back.We need to have refugee camps in the region. We need to provide no-fly zones to make sure that don't even need refugee camps so people can stay in the area. But the last thing we need to do is to relocate moderate Muslims, relocate minorities and Christians out of the region so they're not going to return and reestablish a &mdash; a &mdash; a state that can be won, that can be cooperative for us and safe going forward.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~So what you just said is you agree with me. Because that's exactly what I said.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Thank you, Wolf.It's great to be here in Las Vegas. And I just want to thank everybody for the opportunity to be here.This is an important time in our country's history. We have entered World War III. World War III has begun and we have a leader who refuses to identify it and be truthful to the American people to the stakes that are involved, in part, because his policies have led us here.His policy toward Iran lit the fuse of a nuclear Iran. Just a few weeks ago the International Atomic Agency reported that Iran has had a nuclear program, but they don't know if it's continuing because they refuse to share any information about the current status. And this President marches on, forgiving them hundreds of billions of dollars to allow them to not just reconstitute their robust nuclear program, pursue their missile program, but also to foment terror around the world. And then his policies in the Middle East with Iraq create ISIS. Ladies and gentlemen, we need a President who will be honest with you and identify these problems and defeat them. I hope you will give me the chance to do that. Thank you.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~There has to be a line drawn.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~These are &mdash; these are incidents not something that we're threatening the motherland. This is a tactical decision within an area that we have an obligation for the refugees, for providing stability to the rebels, and an opportunity for the rebels to reconstitute. And, making sure that we stop the flow of refugees into Europe, and into the United States to establish a no-fly zone.And, Russia either is going to comply with it or not, and if they don't, I think it can be contained to that region.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well &mdash; the first thing you have to do is establish a no-fly zone, and you don't do that by just sort of declaring it. You work through the process of making sure you work with people who, hopefully, have the same objective that you do. And, if they don't, then you establish the no-fly zone, and you take the consequences of whatever &mdash; who violates that law.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, I would establish a no-fly zone. And, I think we just
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, there's all sorts of theological reasons why we may not want to go into Syria right now to take ISIS. But let me set that aside for a moment and say this. ISIS is a caliphate. They've established a caliphate, the first Sunni caliphate since 1924, when Ataturk disbanded the Ottoman Empire. They've established a caliphate and, under Islamic law, good Muslims who see them as a legitimate caliphate are required to follow them. That's why we have people in this country who see them as a legitimate caliphate, which is the leader of the Sunni Muslim world, they are required under their law to follow them. How do we defeat their caliphate? Well, it's very clear in Islamic law how you do so. You take their land. You have to take land back from the caliphate and in the Islamic world that delegitimizes, that delegitimizes the caliphate. It makes the caliphate unsuccessful. Therefore not blessed by Allah. Therefore, you should not follow it. We need to take back the land in Iraq and we need to use Sunni, not Shiites, not Iranian troops, not Shiite Iraqis, but Sunni Muslims in Iraq and the Kurds, the Peshmerga, and take back Iraqi land. I believe if we did that, you would see ISIS begin to collapse. And then we can look at other ways in which we're going to deal with it. I have great hesitancy, based on ISIS' desire to draw us into Syria, and a particular town in Syria, for their own, again, apocalyptic version, to go in with ground troops in Syria at this point.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~&mdash; beat Hillary Clinton. But Chris, it's also true that you expanded food stamps at a time that we've got record numbers of Americans on food stamps. It's also true you caved into ObamaCare. You expanded Medicaid.We've got a choice in front of us. This is an important debate. This is not about comparing Louisiana to New Jersey or Bobby to Chris. This is an important debate for the American people.This is supposed to be an economics debate. Let's have a debate.Do we want to grow government or do we want to grow the American economy? Do we want to grow dependence on government, or do we want to grow good paying jobs in the private sector
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~A couple of things.In Louisiana, we're actually a top 10 state for job growth. As we sit here today, we have more people working in Louisiana than ever before, earning a higher income than ever before. We've had 60 months in a row of consecutive job growth in our state. So the reality is, we have diversified our economy. Yes, I've got an interview plan that says all of the above, that creates good manufacturing jobs in America. We've also got one of the fastest growing IT sectors by percentage. We are growing Louisiana's economy.But let me get to the point that is, I think, the most important issue here tonight. You're going to have several hours of debate on the economy and we're going to have a great discussion about energy plans and tax rates. And that's all great.The most important thing we have to do, we have a fundamental choice to make, folks.Are we willing to cut the government economy so we can grow the American economy?That is the most fundamental question we've got to answer. We are on the path to socialism right now. [applause] These are mutually exclusive. The hour is late, but it is not too late for America. Though under President Obama, you asked about his economy. We've got record dependents, a record number of Americans on food stamps, record low participation rate in the work force.This is a fundamental choice. Sending a big government Republican to DC is not enough to fix this problem. It's not enough just to beat Hillary Clinton. We've got to change the direction of our country.What that means is let's shrink the government, not slow its growth rate, but actually shrink the government so we can grow the American economy. That is the fundamental issue we should be debating here tonight.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~But wait a minute, records matter. [applause] Records &mdash; records matter. Yes, we've got to
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~I was absolutely a skeptic of giving this president more power. He negotiated a bad deal with Iran. He breaks the law routinely. I don't know why Congress would want to concede more authority to him. Look, this trade deal is 6,000 pages long. Unlike ObamaCare, I think we should read it before we decide whether we would vote for it or not vote for it. [applause] I am for trade deals, but I want to make sure they are fair trade deals. I want to come back to something that Chris had said earlier. Look, I absolutely agree we've got to beat Hillary Clinton. But just sending any Republican is not good enough. We've had a Republican majority in the Senate and the House.What has changed?If we send another big government Republican to the White House, we will not do enough to fix what is wrong in this country.Chris, I think records matter. I think the way we govern matter.Under your leadership in New Jersey, your budget has gone up 15 percent. It's gone down 26 percent in Louisiana.It has gone up $5 million in New Jersey. It's gone down $9 billion in Louisiana. In New Jersey, you've had nine credit downgrades, setting a record. We've had eight credit upgrades in Louisiana.My point is this. If politicians say they're going to be conservative, they say they're going to cut spending but they don't do it, why should we send them to DC? It gets harder, not easier, when we send them to DC. Let's not be a second liberal party. Let's actually cut government spending. Let's grow the American economy. Let's not just beat Hillary, let's elect a conservative to the White House, not just any Republican.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~No, I think right now there's not much difference between the two parties. The reason we keep losing nationally is we try to be cheaper versions of the Democratic party. What if the Republicans, what if Republicans actually embraced our own principles? So I earlier said if you want bigger paychecks, you want more jobs, you want less government dependence, you're going to have to cut government spending. Here's the dirty little secret.You're going to hear a lot of Republicans tonight in this debate and the next one talk about cutting government spending. It's going to sound great. There's only one of us that's actually cut government spending. Not two, there's one, and you're looking at him. We've got four senators running. They've never cut anything in D.C. They give these long speeches called filibusters, they pat themselves on the back, nothing changes. When they go to relieve themselves their cause and the toilet get flushed at the same time, and the American people lose. We've got a bunch of governors running, we've got seven current former governors running. I'm the only one that has cut government spending. Everybody else can talk about it. If they haven't done it in their state capitals, what makes them thank that &mdash; what makes us think they'll do it if we send them to D.C. Look, when politicians talk, we need to look at what they have done, not what they have said. Otherwise, it's a bunch of hot air. We've cut our budget 26 percent. Record number of Louisianans working.If Republicans want to win national elections, let's be conservatives, let's be Republicans, let's not be a second version of the liberal party, let's cut government spending and grow the American economy.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~So under our tax plan, look, the top rate is 25 percent, 10 percent, 2 percent. That 2 percent is the most important.I think everybody should pay something. I think everybody should have skin in the game. We shouldn't be creating one group of Americans that's dependent on government, another group that's paying taxes. I want to come back to an earlier point though, that Chris said. Look, we all agree Hillary Clinton is bad. We all agree we need to beat her. But let's not pretend that out-of-control government spending is only a Democratic issue. This is a bipartisan issue, and just sending another big government Republican to D.C. is not good enough.We need to actually cut government spending. We need to cut &mdash; and we're not going to do it just by sending any Republican. I'm glad he's vetoed taxes. The Tax Foundation graded New Jersey the 50th worst business climate due to taxes, high taxes in the state of New Jersey.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Thank you.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~This is about [crosstalk] are we going to be the party
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~This is how we .
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~This is how we move our country forward, look, this is not about between me and Chris
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Wait, wait, wait. I want to respond. He has criticized something I said. I want to respond to that. Mike, with all due respect, I admire your social views, I share many of those views, your record as Governor tells a different story. Was &mdash; your time as Governor spending in Arkansas went up 65 percent, number of state workers went up 20 percent, the taxes for the average citizen went up 47 percent. That's not a record of cutting. I'm saying we've actually cut. We reduced the size of our budget. So wanting to cut is one thing, actually cutting is a different thing. Facts don't lie.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~We can waste our time. And I think this is why people were so frustrated with the last debate with these kinds of silly questions. [applause] We've only got a certain amount of time to talk about the economy. Let me use my time to say this. I want to fire everybody in D.C. in both parties. I think they all &mdash; we need term limits, get rid of them all, make them live under the same rules they passed on the rest of us. [cheering and applause]
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~We need a conservative, not a big government republican in D.C.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, a couple of reasons. Look, we know big companies don't pay those taxes today. They hire lobbyists and accountants and lawyers. It's the small businesses that get hit.I want to get rid of the corporate tax, I want to bring the jobs and investment back to America. Make the CEOs pay the same rates as everybody else. Get rid of all the corporate welfare as well.Like I said, make everybody pay something, earned success is so much better than unearned success. And let's actually shrink the size of government. My plan purposely does that.Look, we can talk all night about tax plans, energy plans, I think you will find a lot of agreement among all the Republicans. We all want to get rid of the death tax, the marriage penalty. We all want lower, fewer brackets. We want to downsize, take away power from the IRS.What we really need to be talking about is this, these last seven years, we've had more government spending, more government dependence. Poverty has gone up. Inequality has gone up. Only the top 10 percent have seen their incomes go up &mdash; their median incomes go up.We actually have more inequality thanks to what we have seen, the largest most expensive experiment in progressive government. We can't keep spending money we don't have.And the reality is, the last couple of years it hasn't mattered whether Republicans or Democrats were in control. We keep stealing from our children. That is immoral. It is wrong. And we're creating more government dependence.If we really want to grow the economy, yes, you need a rational energy plan, and you've got to rein in the EPA, and you've got to repeal Obamacare, and you've got to cut taxes. But none of that will be enough if we're not serious about cutting government spending. We cannot afford to elect a big- government Republican. We need somebody. This is the most important election. Hillary Clinton is gift-wrapping this election to us. Let's not waste this opportunity to apply conservative principles and cut the size of government. [applause]
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, a couple things, first, I want to echo what others have said and thank those veterans that run towards danger, not away from it, so we can live in the greatest country in the history of the world. I think every veteran should get that card, and they should be allowed to get that health care wherever they want in the private sector. But, I also think &mdash; or the public sector, I also think we need to fire some of the V.A. bureaucrats. Somebody should go to jail over these scandals, and it is a crime that it has not happened. [applause]When it comes &mdash; when it comes to uniting the American people, one of the things we've done to honor our veterans in Louisiana, we've given thousands &mdash; and I've hand delivered these, to veterans &mdash; medals to veterans to thank them for their service. I'll just give you one quick example, I know my time is out, but, we've had Vietnam war veterans with tears in their eyes saying nobody has ever thanked them before. We've had World War II veterans, children, who said they never heard the stories of their parents heroic sacrifice. Whatever conflict, whenever they served, one of the things we can do is to teach our children we do live in the greatest country in the history of the world. We got a president who doesn't believe in American exceptionalism, but we still do, and it's because of those men and women in uniform. We should thank them everyday, not just veterans day. [applause]
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, look, only one other opponent, actually, one other candidate, actually, has a plan. That's Jeb Bush, and he creates a new entitlement program. My plan actually gets rid of all of Obamacare, it's great that Senator Cruz will shut down the government over Obamacare, but he still hasn't given us his plan to get rid of it. It's great that other republicans talk about getting rid of it.You go to a town hall in Iowa, or New Hampshire, ask them how they're actually going to get rid of it &mdash; my plan has been online for over a year. It gets rid of all of Obamacare, it reduces the cost. It actually puts Americans, their patients, their doctors back in control. And, it actually helps those that really need this help &mdash; but, this is one of the most critical issues we face domestically.I think I &mdash; look, right now, I think I am the only candidate running that refused to expand Medicaid. I'm the only one that turned down &mdash; that did what we could to fight Obamacare. This is an important point, and, look, I appreciate Chris's nice compliments to me. And, Chris, you look to me very well, I love Mary-pat, but this isn't about me and Chris. This is about the country, and this is about what direction &mdash; this is the most important election in our lifetimes.Folks, a couple of years ago they told us give them the republican majorities in the House and the Senate, they'd stop Obamacare, and amnesty, and the bad Iran deal &mdash; nothing changed. If they fooled us once, shame on them. If they fooled us twice, shame on us. Don't let them fool us again.Chris, look, I'll give you your ribbon for participation, and a juicebox, but in the real world, it's about results [audience reaction] but, in the real world it's about results. It's about actually cutting government spending, not just talking about cutting government spending.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~you don't grow the economy by putting more people on food stamps, more people in Medicaid, you grow the economy by cutting government, cutting spending. That's what we've done in Louisiana, you haven't done that in New Jersey
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~You know, I have spent a lot of time tonight talking about the need to cut the size of government. The reason I'm doing that &mdash; it's not just about balancing the budget, or balancing a bunch of numbers. Because I believe in the American dream. I think President Obama's done a lot of damage to our country. I think that one of the worst things he has done is try to change the idea of America to be one of dependence. There are a lot of politicians that talk about cutting government spending, I'm the only one that's actually done it that's running for President.The rest of them, it's a lot of hot air. If you want your paychecks to go up, if you want more good paying jobs, if you want the government out of your lives, we've got to cut the size of government. It's not enough just to elect any republican, we've seen that. We've got to elect a republican that will take on the establishment in both parties. I'm asking for your support. Thank you. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~..Let me
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~First off, let me, let me just say this in response to this back and forth. For the people who are out there right now, I want to guarantee you one thing real clearly. If you think that Mike Huckabee won't be the kind of President who will cut back spending, or Chris Christie, or John Kasich, wait 'til you see what Hillary Clinton will do to this country and how she will drown us in debt. She is the real adversary tonight and we'd better stay focused as Republicans on her.Now I've forward, I put forward an entitlement reform plan. We spend 71 cents of every dollar in America on entitlements and debt service, and if &mdash; you know, Willy Sutton used to say, when they asked him why he robbed banks, he said that's 'cause that's where the money is, OK? And where the money is in the federal government are these entitlement programs and debt service.What I've said is we need to get a hold of that. We cannot continue to go down the $19 trillion in debt.So our plan will save over $1 trillion over the next 10 years and make sure that Social Security and Medicare are there for those who truly need it and also make sure that we have money to be able to reduce taxes and spend on the things we need to spend.I will also, on my first day as &mdash; as president, sign a executive order that says no more regulation for the next 120 days by any government agency or department. We are drowning in regulations. Stop and then we'll go out there and we'll cut and reduce regulation that small business owners across this country want us to do.You'll grow the economy then. More money will come into the system and we'll get more closer to balance. But the bottom line is, believe me, Hillary Clinton's coming for your wallet, everybody. Don't worry about Huckabee or Jindal, worry about her. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Gerry, this has been the most political Federal Reserve I've seen in my lifetime. Now, when they first cut interest rates during the economic recession and the crisis, that was the right thing to do. But they've kept those interest rates artificially low for one reason, and one reason only. Because they're trying to politically support Barack Obama and his agenda. And it's been wrong.And what it's done, in an administration where the President has talked about income inequality, he's had more income inequality in this administration than any previous administration. The middle class is doing worse than it's ever done before. And the investor class, the wealthy, are doing even better because of this cheap money from the Fed. And here's the worst part, we had one and a half percent GDP growth last quarter. If we slide back towards a recession, you cannot lower interest rates below zero. Where are we going to go if we need help if the economy slides back into recession?And with this government- controlled economy that Barack Obama, we're moving right towards it. The Fed should be audited and the Fed should stop playing politics with our money supply. That's what they've done. It's been the wrong thing to do. It's hurting the American economy. And [applause] let me [applause] let me add one other thing on this. Be very aware now, because what Hillary Clinton is talking about doing, if she's president of the United States, is to make sure that the government gets even more involved in the economy, even more involved in making choices for everybody. You do not want that to happen. You need someone who's going to stand up on that stage and prosecute the case against her and prosecute it strong. [buzzer noise] That's what I'll do. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~I'll continue in the pattern and just say [laughter] And just say this to everybody, since it seems to be an open question. [laughter] I'll tell you the thing that disturbs me the most about what's going on with the Democratic Party in Washington, that they're not standing behind our police officers across this country. [cheering and applause] That they're allowing lawlessness [cheering and applause] That they're allowing lawlessness to reign in this country. I spent seven years of my life in law enforcement, here's what every law enforcement, 700,000, should know tonight. When President Christie is in the Oval Office, I'll have your back. [cheering and applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~I'll tell you, Gerry, it's interesting, if you go to New Jersey, they'll call me lots of different things. A liberal is not one of them. Um, and [laughter] I would say this. I have great respect for Bobby's record in Louisiana. I think he's been a wonderful governor and I think he's provided outstanding leadership for that state and I respect him for what he's done. And I think that all of us deserve that same level of respect.And my point is this. You know, the differences between me and Bobby Jindal, we can talk about those, and obviously, Bobby wants to spent a lot of time tonight talking about that.I'll tell you what I want to talk about. I want to talk about what's going to happen to this country if we have another four years of Barack Obama's policies.And by the way, it will be even worse, because Hillary Clinton is running so far to the left to treaty to catch up to her socialist opponent, Bernie Sanders, it's hard to even see her anymore. The fact is &mdash; the fact is that we'd better be focused on it. And I'll tell you what I'll bring to the table, the fact that I've won in a blue state, that I've won in a state that has 750,000 more Democrats than Republicans [applause] that I won in a state for reelection after governing as a pro-life conservative [buzzer noise] and got 61 percent of the vote. That's the person you want on the stage prosecuting the case against Hillary Clinton. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~I don't
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~I want to tell the American people who are watching tonight the truth. I saw the most disgraceful thing I've seen in this entire campaign a few weeks ago. Hillary Clinton was asked the enemy she's most proud of, and she said, "Republicans". In a world where we have Al-Qaeda, and ISIS, the mullahs in Iran, and Vladimir Putin &mdash; the woman who asks to run and represent all of the United States says that her greatest enemies are people like you in this audience, and us here. I will tell you one thing, and write this down, when you elect me President of the United States, I will go to Washington not only to fight the fights that need fighting, not only to say what I mean, and mean what I say, but to bring this entire country together for a better future for our children and grandchildren. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Let me just
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Sure. [applause] It's interesting. I complimented Bobby, imagine how much time he'd want if I actually criticized him. [laughter] You know, the fact is, he's done &mdash; done a nice job down in Louisiana, and I don't have any problem with the job he's done. I've cut spending $2 billion dollars, except for our pension and health care in New Jersey, which was driven predominantly by Obamacare. We have reduce the number of employees we have on the state payroll by 15%, but, you know what? The people out there don't care about any of that.You know what they care about? They care about who's going to be able to beat Hillary Clinton [bell ringing] Who's going to keep their eye on the ball? I'm going to keep my eye on the ball. [crosstalk]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~The way to reconnect Americans to the men and women in uniform is to first, and foremost, give them a Commander in Chief who respects the military, and respects everyone who wears the uniform. [cheering and applause]Starts at the top there [cheering and applause]And Secretary Clinton says, there's no crisis at the V.A.. That send a long, and hard message to our veterans that she doesn't get it, and she doesn't respect their service. When the President of the United States doesn't back up law enforcement officers in uniform, he loses the moral authority to any man or woman who is uniform. I spent seven years in law enforcement [bell ringing] I respect these folks, and I will do so as Commander in Chief of the military.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, first I want to share a story with you that relates to your question. I was in New Hampshire last week, and a woman approached me after the town hall meeting and she said to me, "Governor, I'm really concerned."I said, "What are your concerns?"And, she said, "I don't quite how to describe it," she said. "But, every month when my bills come in, I feel this awful anxiety in the pit of my stomach that I'm not going to have enough to pay them that month."There are tens of millions of Americans living that way after the worst recovery from an economic recession since World War II. And, let's be clear, if we do not change course, if we follow the President's lead, and that's exactly what Secretary Clinton will do, we're going to be in the same circumstance &mdash; with government picking the winners and losers.So, let me be clear about what we'll do. First, Make the tax code fairer, flatter, and simplier. Get rid of all the special interest deductions. You know, the American people feel like the tax code is rigged for the rich, and you know why they feel that way? Because it is. We'll get rid of all those special interest deductions except for the home mortgage interest deduction, and the charitable contribution deduction. Everyone will get lower rates, keep more of their own money, be able to file their tax returns in 15 minutes, and, by the way, the good thing, I'll be able to fire a whole bunch of IRS agents once we do that. [applause] And, in addition, we need to get the government off of our backs. Dodd-Frank, all the different regulations, 81,000 pages of new regulation by this administration just last year &mdash; it is suffocating small business, it is suffocating the folks who are trying to make a living. I will do what I did in New Jersey [bell ringing] lift if off their backs. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, let's start with this, remember why we're in the position we're in with China, because an absolutely weak and feckless foreign policy that was engineered by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. That's why we're in the position we're in [applause] because the Chinese [applause] the Chinese don't take us seriously and why should they? Why should they?They hacked into the American government's personnel file and took millions of records in cyberwarfare against this country. I'm one of the victims of that hack. They took my Social Security number, my fingerprints as a former United States attorney that was on file in there.And what has this president done?Not one thing.Let me be really clear about what I would do. If the Chinese commit cyberwarfare against us, they are going to see cyberwarfare like they have never seen before. And that is a closed society in China [applause] where they're hiding information from their own people. The information we take, we'll make sure all the Chinese people see it. Then they'll have some real fun in Beijing when we start showing them how they're spending their money in China. [applause] And one last thing. One last thing. I will tell you this, they're building those artificial islands in the South China Sea and the president won't &mdash; up until recently, wouldn't sail a ship within 12 miles or fly a plane over it. I'll tell you this, the first thing I'll do with the Chinese is I'll throw &mdash; I'll fly Air Force One over those islands. They'll know we mean business. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Yeah, listen. We stopped Obamacare in New Jersey because we refused to participate in the federal exchange. But, here's the bigger issue. What do you think's going to happen when Hillary Clinton's elected president of the United States? The woman who tried to impose healthcare on this country over 20 years ago? And, she was stopped then by a strong group of republicans, and an American public that said, "No, thank you."What she will do &mdash; what she will do is move us towards a single payer system. She will completely nationalize the federal health care system. That's what she wanted to do 20 years ago, and I guarantee you that's what she'll do if you give her the keys to the White House one more time.The fact is we need someone who knows how to beat democrats, who knows how to beat democrats in a democratic area. I've done it twice as governor of New Jersey, and Hillary Clinton doesn't want one minute on that stage with me next September when I'm debating her, and prosecuting her for her vision for America
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Yes, sure. [laughter] If anybody believes the stuff they heard from that Democratic debate a few weeks ago, there's nothing for free. What they forgot to tell was that they're going to raise your tax rates to 70 or 80 percent in order to provide all of that stuff. But let me ask the folks at home one very simple question, do you want to give Washington more control over your life? Do you think they're doing such a great job that now let's have them control what our corporations pay their employees? Let's have them control every aspect of our economy?Is Washington doing that good a job for you right now? And the fact is that if you listen to Hillary Clinton, she has made it very clear, she believes that she can make decisions for you better than you can make them for yourself.She believes that Washington, D.C., should pick the winners and losers in our economy, and in our life. And here's what I believe as a Republican, I believe the greatness of America is not in its government. The greatness of America is in the American people. And what we need to do is get the government the hell out of the way and let the American people win once again. [cheering and applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Yes. You know, our tax plan puts forward a highest rate of 28 percent for those who are doing the most and making the most in this country and 8 percent on the low end. And I agree with Senator Santorum, we get rid of all of the deductions and loopholes, except for the home mortgage interest deduction and the charitable contribution deduction. That means getting rid of the state and local income tax deduction, as well, because that will put more pressure on governors and on local officials not to keep raising those taxes, saying we can deduct them.And so ours will be 28 on the high end, 8 on the low end. And I will tell you one other thing. Americans for Tax Reform came out with a report six weeks ago and said I vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history. I will do exactly the same thing as president of the United States. [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Absolutely. Absolutely, because what we need to is to make sure that they tie the monetary standard to something that makes sense, rather than to their own whims, because who's getting gut punched?It ain't the people in Wall Street, it's the folks on Main Street. They're the ones who's wages have been stagnant for 40 years. And the average American today has a total savings of 1,000 bucks. One root canal and they're in trouble. And if their car breaks down the same week [buzzer noise] they're out of business.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~I'd like to get that opportunity to go
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~In many ways, I feel like I'm the luckiest guy on Earth. I really do. It's a long way from a little brick rent house on second street in Hope, Arkansas to this stage where I'm running for President of the United States. It's not about me, not about these guys &mdash; 'ought to be about you, and I've never been the favorite of the people who have the most money.But, I want to be the favorite of the people who still want to believe the American dream can work for them. Today in our office, I got a letter from a third grader in North Dakota, her name is Reese.She sent $6 dollars from her allowance, and said, "I want to help you be president." You know, I'm going to keep standing on this stage, and keep fighting for one reason, because somewhere out there in North Dakota, and all over America, there are kids like Reese who need a president who will never forget where they came from, and I promise I won't. [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Let me finish, please. I'm going to ask you just this, what would happen if the Congress and the president had to get their health care from the VA? We would fix the problem and we would fix Congress. [cheering and applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Sandra, before we get too far away, he specifically brought out some things about the record that I need to correct.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Sandra, I've been concerned that this administration has not done anything to help stop the slaughter of Christians. We didn't help the Kurds, we said we would. But, the idea that we're just going to open our doors, and we have no idea who these people are &mdash; what we do know is that only one out of five of the so called, "Syrian Refugees", who went into Europe were actually Syrian. Many of them, we had no idea who they were. They weren't Syrian.Are we going to open the doors so that the ISIS people will come on in, and we'll give them a place to say, and a good sandwich, and medical benefits? My gosh, we have $19 trillion dollars in debt, we can't even afford to take care of Americans.So [applause] If we're going to do something for the Syrians [applause] let's find out who they really are, and the ones that are really in danger, let's help build an encampment for them, but closer to where they live, rather than bringing them here when they don't know the language, the culture &mdash; and, frankly, if we've got as many homeless people as we have, I'm not sure this makes any sense.So, let's do it where we can best help them. Send them some food. But, let's ask the Saudi's to step up. I'm really tired of Americans being the only ones asked to do all the heavy lifting when it comes to charity, and, quite frankly, my number one concern right now is taking care of the fact that Americans are taking it in the gut without jobs. Many of them working two and three part time jobs. And, if America wants to do something great, let's get our economy growing again, stabilize the dollar, and we'll be in a much better position to help people around the world.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, first of all, do you know an American that will just stop spending? I don't. [laughter] No, that's not going to be the problem. Look, Americans will go to the marketplace with more money they've ever had. For the first time they'll be having their whole paycheck. You see, most people don't understand that when you buy something that is made in America, 22 percent of the cost of it is the embedded tax they never even know they paid. It's why China has beaten the daylights out of us, they can build stuff that we can't because they're not taxing it, when they don't tax capital and labor and we do.They bring something over here, it's automatically cheaper even without the regulatory environment because they're not embedding the taxes, we are.Take the embedded taxes out. Give a person his whole paycheck because every American would no longer have a payroll tax taken out. It means they'd see their real paycheck for the first time. When they go to spend that money, they'll actually have it.And they only pay taxes on the stuff that's new. So a lot of Americans will buy used stuff. Look, here's the point, Americans are not going to quit shopping. Americans are not going to quit buying. But it would be nice if Americans could control how much they paid in tax, rather than having the government reach into their pockets and take it out before they ever had a chance to even see it, much less spend it. [applause] And that's why the fair tax makes a heck of a lot more sense than punishing productivity and rewarding irresponsibility.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, first of all, Trish, I don't know why we have to move away from manufacturing. The only reason we have is because  [applause]  we have a tax code that has punished manufacturing. I hear a lot of people talk about the plans to simplify the tax code. I've got one better than any of the simplifications, it's called a, "Fair Tax", and it eliminates all of the taxes on our productivity. Here's what would happen. We'd get rid of taxes on people's work, so, we wouldn't punish people for working anymore. Yeah, we've lost five million manufacturing jobs just since the year 2000 &mdash; 160,000 manufacturing plants have close in this country, which means a lot of people &mdash; that the governors talking about, he's exactly right. They don't have jobs anymore. And the reason they don't have jobs is because their jobs are in Mexico, they're in China, they're in Indonesia. Bring the jobs back. And with the fair tax, you do that, because you don't tax capital and labor and you bring a real sense of equity to the opportunity so that people will not only make it easier to function, they'll get the manufacturing jobs back. And here's the best part. We don't reduce the IRS, we get rid of the IRS. We completely eliminate them [applause] because the government has no business knowing how much money we make and how we made it. It's none of their business. And that's why I believe that manufacturing is critical. If we can't feed ourselves, fuel ourselves and fight for ourselves, we can't be free. And by the way, fighting for ourselves means manufacturing our own weapons of self-defense.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, I'd just like to respond, with all due respect to, to the Governor, to the state just south of me, I would say that a lot of us have cut things. And during the recession of 2001 to 2003, when 91 percent of our state budget was basically three things, educate, medicate and incarcerate, we ended up cutting 11 percent out of the state budget through that recession so we didn't have to go in and raise a bunch of taxes, and there were people who thought we should.So it's just not accurate to say that nobody else up here has ever cut. I believe every governor has probably had to make tough decisions. I'm, I'm guessing my colleague Governor Christie has, as I'm tossing him the ball like Arkansas did to Ol' Miss the other day.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, I think thanking our veterans is a wonderful thing to do, but, they sure appreciate a better paycheck. They'd appreciate the fact that we kept our promises to them. The men and women in uniform put on the uniform of our nation, they went halfway around the world, they face dangers on our behalf, and we promised them if they did that, when they came home we'd take care of their medical care, we'd make is possible for their kids to go to college, and they'd be able to bind to a home. They kept their promises to us. We have not kept our promises to them, and today, less than one percent of Americans go to the military for service. We're fighting wars with other people's kids in large measure because we've not taken seriously the moral, not the monetary, the moral obligation to take care of the veterans and to keep America's promise to the ones who kept their promise to America. [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, my wife's name is Janet and when you say Janet Yelling, I'm very familiar with what you mean. [laughter] But, look, I think the Fed is in a big trouble because they haven't addressed the number one issue that's hurting Americans and that's the fact that wages for the bottom 90 percent of the economy have been stagnant for 40 years. In the 25 years after World War II, up to 1971, wages grew by 85 percent in this country. People were &mdash; were moving up in the middle class. There was a middle class.That's not happening any more, and in large measure, the Fed has manipulated the dollar so it doesn't have a standard.Tie the dollar to something fixed and if it's not going to be gold, make it the commodity basket.But here's what we've got to do. We absolutely have to get it where the people who go out there and work get something in return.And if the dollar keeps fluctuating, and this is as crazy as &mdash; as is the price of bread, well, the fact is, people can't get ahead then.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, Sandra, first of all, let me mention the fact that I think there's a big difference between welfare programs and what some people call entitlements. Namely, Social Security and Medicare.I just want to remind everybody out there who has ever had a paycheck, the government didn't ask you if you wanted them to take money out of your check for Social Security and Medicare. They did that involuntarily.Those are not entitlements and that's not welfare. That's an earned benefit. And by gosh, you paid for it. And if the government screwed it up, you shouldn't have to pay the penalty because of an incompetent government.That's different than the social programs that we've spent $2 trillion on since the War on Poverty began exactly 50 years ago this year. Now the reason we still have so much poverty is because it was never designed to get people out of poverty. It was designed to make sure that there was an industry of poverty, so that the people in the poverty industry would have a lot of jobs. But the people who are poor haven't been benefited. Having grown up poor, I know a little something about it. Nobody who is poor wants to be. That's a nonsense statement and I hear it all the time. Well, poor people ought to work harder. They're working as hard as they can, for gosh sake.But the problem is the system keeps pushing them down because, if they work, then they get punished. They lose all the benefits. When we did welfare reform in the '90s, you know what we did? We said you're not going to lose everything at once. There's not an arbitrary threshold. So as you move up the ladder from work and training, you'll actually always be better off than you were before. That's the American way.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, since we're not going to answer the question, let me just remind everybody, tomorrow is Veterans Day. And here's what I would like to remind everybody. The VA has been a disaster in large part because the people in Congress have never bothered to fix it, and this president has certainly not
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, thank you very much.I still want to go back to the fact that if we got rid of all the taxes on our work, got rid of the taxes on our savings, investments, capital gains, and inheritance, and made a zero tax, we'd pay at the point of consumption.Because why should we punish people for their productivity? And the fair tax doesn't punish people for doing well and building the economy. There's $31 trillion parked offshore. What happens if that money comes back to America? You'd think it'd goose the economy? I guarantee you it would. And that's why the fair tax is the best solution we have for economic growth in this country. [applause]
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~&mdash; States Marine Corps.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Absolutely. I'm a capitalist, not a corporatist. I'm not someone who believes we should be bailing out corporations whether their auto industries, or banks. [applause]And, it is simply a matter that there's auto industry &mdash; the auto industry would have survived, it would have survived through a bankruptcy process of &mdash; instead of Washington picking a winner and a loser. And, in this case, the losers are the bondholders, and the winners were the unions. That's fine. They did it, the unions &mdash; the unions survived. We &mdash; we have not survived in continuing to grow manufacturing jobs. We have a &mdash; we have a president, and an economy right now, that is killing &mdash; choking our ability to be able to compete.I'm one of the few people up here who actually believes that we need a level playing field when it comes to manufacturing. That means a good tax code, a good regulatory environment, low energy prices, better opportunities for workers to get training, and, also, I'm &mdash; a supporter of the EXIM bank. Everybody else on this stage, everybody else, I think, in the entire field, is opposed to it.Why can you &mdash; how can you come out and say I'm for manufacturing when a majority of republican congressmen and senators supported the EXIM bank because it means jobs for American workers here in America. The fact is that we've seen already G.E. lose jobs here in America, and just move those jobs to France and Hungary. We have a right as a country to compete with other countries that have export financing. Every major manufacturer, 60 countries, competes against America, wants to take our jobs, and we have every Republican candidate &mdash; you want to talk about communicating to workers here in Wisconsin? [bell rings] Ask them why we're tying one hand behind our back and saying go out and compete. [applause]
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Happy Birthday.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~I'll answer that in a second, but, I want to answer this other problem because this is a real legitimate debate between Chris and Bobby, and if somebody says we need someone who can win in a blue state, and Bobby says we need a real principled conservative. [audience reaction] [applause] Ninety-two percent conservative voting record, unlike some of the other senators that Bobby mentioned who hasn't done anything to cut federal spending, I was actually the author of welfare reform, which is the only time we've ever seen a federal entitlement actually cut. We cut it. Senate did exactly what every conservative says they want to do. We took the program, we eliminated the federal entitlement, we blocked (ph) to the state, we capped the amount of money, cut it by about 10%, and then put two requirements, work, and time limits.We need to do that with the rest of the &mdash; means (ph) tested federal entitlements. I've done it. And I did it with a bipartisan support in the House and Senate, and after fighting two presidential vetoes by Bill Clinton. So I had a democratic president we had to get this through. No record of accomplishment. I agree with the folks who are from the Congress in this race. I have a record of accomplishment of being a conservative on everything.National security, on moral and cultural issues, on the economy, and twice won a blue state. The first time I beat the author of Hillarycare. I had Bill and Hillary in my state, James Carville managed the race against me, a state with a million more Democrats than Republicans.And I ran on health savings accounts, on private sector health care, as a conservative, pro-life, pro-family, and I won. And then in 2000, I was the only senator to win a state as a conservative that George Bush lost. You want someone who can win Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, with a conservative message, I'm your guy. [applause]
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~I'll be happy to answer that if you give me more time.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~I'm going to answer two questions for the price of one. The infrastructure question, the answer is [laughter] We need to get the federal government out of this infrastructure business, other than vital economic highways. It has been said that if we cut the gas tax to 3 to 5 cents and send the rest back to the states, and just take care of the federal infrastructure that's vital for our economy, let the &mdash; we don't need the federal government and the road business that it is today. Number one.Number two, you know who I respect in the Democratic Party? You know why I respect them? Because they fight! Because they're not willing to back down, and they're willing to stand up and fight and win. And so I respect them because they are willing to take it to us.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~I announced from a factory floor in Western Pennsylvania. This campaign has all been about two words for me, working families. Working. Getting people the opportunity to see those wages rise, to be on the side of the American workers so they can get good paying jobs, and that means we have to start making things in America again. We need a president who's going to not just put policies in place, but is going to stand up at the bully pulpit and talk about the dignity of being a welder. The dignity of being a carpenter, about going to work and earning success. And, also, the importance of families, the importance of families and fathers, and mothers raising their children, and committing to that so that they can give children in our country the best opportunity to success. Working families is the key for us to win this election. [applause]
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~It should come as no surprise to Chris, or anybody else, that Barack Obama doesn't stand behind our men and women in uniform here at home because he hasn't stood behind them overseas.The rules of engagement that we've allowed our soldiers to go and fight against have put them in harm's way for political purposes. This has been the most politicized wars that we've ever seen under this administration. He gets in, and gets out, based upon what the polls are saying, what pressure he's getting from groups. Talk about a Commander in Chief. We need a commander in chief who has a vision and plan of how we're going to execute the national security of our country. Commander in chief is not an entry level position. Experience matters, and that's why I would ask for your support as a Commander in Chief, because I have the experience against the enemy [bell ringing] to confront to do the job. [applause]
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Let me settle this argument
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~That's very personal to me. I grew up on a V.A. grounds. I lived in apartments on V.A. grounds my entire childhood. Both my Mom and Dad, after World War II, marry &mdash; met at a V.A., married, and that's where I lived. Kitchen table discussion was, particularly when I was growing up in the 1960's and 1970's, was the decline of the V.A.When they joined in the early 1950's, the V.A. was the top. They were the best, they were the best and brightest coming in after the war. And, we believed in the cause that we fought, and we invested in our hospitals to make sure that our veterans who left World War II were taken care of. But, after Vietnam, and during Vietnam, that began to change, and it really hasn't recovered since. The bottom line is the V.A. is antiquated. There's no need for a V.A. healthcare system as it existed after World War &mdash; why? Because we have the best private healthcare system in the world, we didn't need &mdash; we needed it in 1950's, hospitals were not particularly advanced, so, we built the best. We didn't maintain the best. Government didn't keep its promises to its veterans. So, what we need to do is two things. Number one, we need to allow veterans to go to private sector hospitals for their routine and ordinary care to get the best care in their community possible. [applause]And, there is a place for the Veterans Administration. There are injuries, and there are &mdash; things like PTSD, or prosthetics that are uniquely problems within the veterans community where we can develop centers of excellence within &mdash; and replace the V.A. with a group of [bell ringing] centers of excellence that can help our folks to come back
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~The middle of America is hollowing out. All you have to do is listen to the last Democratic debate and you would think there was a Republican president in office the way they complained about how bad things are in America and how the middle &mdash; the middle of America is hollowing out.I agree with Mike Huckabee. I spent this morning in Chicago at Fabtech, which is a sheet manufac &mdash; a sheet metal fabricators conference. Thousands of people there explained the latest and newest technologies.You know what I was told?I was told when I went to booth after booth that there are 250,000 welder jobs open in America &mdash; 250,000 welder jobs paying anywhere from $50,000 to $70,000 a year, and if you want to weld pipe on a, you know, for oil and gas pipelines, you can make $100,000 a year.Every manufacturer &mdash; I go to one every single week. In fact, I have with me in the &mdash; in the crowd here today a gentleman who is a supporter of mine from Rockwall, Texas, Ed Grand-Lienard. He runs Special Products.And he tells me he has jobs open in every skill that he &mdash; he &mdash; he could possibly hire for in Rockwall, Texas, but he can't find people.So the issue is, yes, we need a tax code. I &mdash; I propose a 20 percent flat tax &mdash; 20 percent on corporations, 20 percent on &mdash; on individuals, full expensing, which will be powerful for manufacturing, a 0 percent rate, initially, for manufacturers.We're going to have a very powerful tax code. We're going to do something about regulation. We're going to suspected every single ObamaCare regu &mdash; Obama regulation that cost over $100,000 to the economy. But we have to start doing something about training and employing people who are sitting on the sidelines because they don't see a path. And we have a &mdash; a bureaucracy in Washington and a president in Washington &mdash; and even among Republicans who think everybody has to go to college. People need to go to work and we need to provide [buzzer noise] opportunities for them to go to work out of high school. [applause]
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, I'll tell you, I have a 20 percent flat tax. That's one all income &mdash; so capital gains, corporations, individuals, 20 percent. I think that's a fair number, one out of five, to be able to &mdash; to help support the federal government.By the way it also approximates, if you take out some of the deductions, it approximates how much the federal government is, on average, spent of GDP, which is about 18 to 19 percent of GDP.So it actually fits with shrinking the size of government down to more like post-World War II levels.So the second thing we do is I don't allow for deductibility of state and local taxes, which will require state and local taxes to go down in order to be treated for their &mdash; for their people to be treated fairly.So the answer is, 20 percent and probably 33 percent overall.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, I don't &mdash; I agree with Governor Christie, I don't think you can make it any more political than it's been. They &mdash; they are protecting a president that is over-taxing and over- regulating, shutting down this economy. And he &mdash; and they're keeping it up like Atlas, trying to hold up the Earth by &mdash; by these ridiculously low interest rates.And it's hurting American seniors, who are seeing no Social Security increases, seeing no &mdash; no savings. They're &mdash; they're putting their money aside. They're getting nothing in their deposit accounts.This is hurting the people who have acted responsibly, all in favor of those who, um, you know, are &mdash; are speculators and &mdash; and those on Wall Street. It's not a good deal for &mdash; for the vast majority of responsible Americans.The other thing we have with the Fed is they've been given way too much authority. Under Dodd-Frank, they've been given this enormous new authority. I mean they &mdash; they now have almost become the most powerful entity in Washington, DC.We need to repeal Dodd-Frank, get away that authority from the Fed and put them under more &mdash; more scrutiny.That's only part of the problem. I understand the Fed is interesting for a business channel, but I think for most Americans, the most important business is the family. And we haven't really talked much about the importance of the family to the economy.And &mdash; and ladies and gentlemen, every single book, from left to right, that's been written over the last couple of years has said the biggest problem in America today at the hollowing out of the middle of America is the breakdown of the nuclear family in America. We'd better be the party that's out there talking about this issue and what we're going to do to help strengthen marriage and return dads into homes in all communities. [applause] You want to talk about the communities that are hurting the most, the ones you see the protests in [buzzer noise] there are no dads. And we need to do something about it. [applause]
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, the answer is first that we need to do something about a tax code that doesn't penalize. One thing that I'm excited about our tax code, proposed changes, is it's very pro-family.You have a $2,700 tax credit, period, for every person in that family, so that family, you know, would have about an $8,000 tax credit, which would be refundable. So every dollar she works, she's still only losing 20 cents.The problem with the tax code today, because of all the different provisions, you're right, you go back to work, you lose welfare benefits, you're losing money. Throw on top of that the &mdash; even a bigger problem, over 50 percent of children being raised in a home today of a single mom are raised in a home where the father is born &mdash; father is (sic) living at the child &mdash; the time the child is born.Now what does that mean? That means we have incentivized people not to marry. We've incentivized people to cohabitate instead of not marry, why? Because mom will lose welfare benefits if she marries father.It's not just mom going back to work, but it's mother and father marrying to form a more stable family for that child to be raised in a two-parent family. So we've got all sorts of really corrupt incentives that were put in place, well meaning by the left. But we need to remove those. We need to remove those incentives. We need to adopt a tax code that says we're going to be pro-family and pro-work. And that's what we'll do. [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~America must lead because when we do not lead, when this exceptional nation does not lead, the world is more dangerous and a more tragic place.Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, they all refuse to lead. Worse, they refuse to respond when this nation is provoked. Hillary Clinton famously asked what difference does it make how four Americans died in Benghazi?Mrs. Clinton, here's what difference it makes. When you do not stand up and say the truth, that this was a purposeful terrorist attack, when you do not say the United States of America will retaliate for that attack, terrorists assume it's open season.We have refused to respond to every provocation. The President wouldn't even mention the fact that Iran had taken two Navy boats and our sailors &mdash; hostage. He didn't mention the fact that they violated the Geneva convention. He didn't respond to the fact that Iran launched two ballistic missile just a short time ago, in direct violation of a deal they had just signed. We didn't respond to the fact that North Korea attacked Sony Pictures.When we refuse to respond over, and over to provocation and bad behavior, we will get more provocation and bad behavior. I know most of our allies personally. I have met many of our adversaries. I know our military and our intelligence capability, and I know this. When we will not stand with our allies, when we will not respond to our adversaries, when we do not lead in the world the world is a dangerous and tragic place. I will be a Commander in Chief who will lead. [applause]

Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~As CEO of Hewlett Packard
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~As CEO of Hewlett Packard, I was asked very specifically for some very real help. The help I was asked to provide, this is now public information. So I am not revealing what &mdash; something that was &mdash; was classified.We had a very large shipment of equipment, software and hardware, headed to a retail outlet. And I was called by the head of the NSA, who had an urgent need for that capability, to begin laying out a program to track terrorists.We turned that truck around on a highway and it was escorted to the headquarters in San Jose.In World War II, our government went to the private sector and said, help us do things that we cannot do.The private sector has capabilities that the government does not have. There are some legal authorities that are required.The Sony attack could have been detected and repelled, had legal authorities been passed in Congress allowing private networks and public networks to work together.Those legal authorities have not yet been passed.Yes, I was asked to help. [bell rings]I know the technology industry. They will help again. But they must be asked by a president who understands what they have.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~For decades, the professional political class in both parties has been talking about the middle class. For decades, Republicans in particular have been talking about reducing the size and scope of government, spending less money, reducing the complexity.And yet, for 40 years, the government has gotten bigger and more expensive.We now have a 75,000 plus page tax code, although politicians have run for office for decades promising reform. And all the while, middle class incomes have stagnated.You see, when government gets bigger and bigger, more powerful, the rich get richer, the poor get poorer and the middle class gets squeezed.We need to understand who the job creators are in this country, because we need more jobs to grow the middle class and to grow the wages of the middle class.Who creates jobs?Small businesses, new businesses, family-owned businesses. [applause] They create two thirds of the new jobs in this country and they employ half the people.I started out typing for a nine person real estate firm. My husband Frank started out driving a tow truck for a family-owned auto body shop. And we are crushing small businesses and destroying the middle class.So here's my blueprint to take back America. Let us first actually reform the tax code from 73,000 pages down to three. There's a 20-year-old plan to do exactly that.And then let us begin piece by piece to focus on every single dollar the government spends, so that we will spend less overall and still have enough for our priorities. And that requires the government to budget the way you do at home &mdash; examine every dollar, cut any dollar, move any dollar. The fancy term for that is zero- based budgeting, but I call it common sense.Citizens, we've got to take our country back. [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~My husband Frank, that I mentioned, I love spending time with. He's down there. He was real excited the other day because in New Hampshire, he was introduced as my eye candy. [laughter]You know, everybody out there watching knows this. You cannot wait to see the debate between me and Hillary Clinton. You would pay to see that fight. [applause] And that's because you know I will win. And that's important. We've got to start by beating Hillary Clinton.All of my life, I have been told to sit down and be quiet. Settle. Settle. Don't challenge the system.That's what the American people are being told now and we have been told that for way too long &mdash; sit down and be quiet about our God, about our guns, about the abortion industry, settle for illegal immigration that's been a problem for decades, as so many of our problems have festered for decades. Accept a system of government and politics that no longer works for us.I will not sit down and be quiet. And neither will you.So I ask you to stand with me, fight with me, vote for me, citizens. It is time to take our future back, time to take our politics back. It is time to take our government back. Citizens, it is time. We must take our country back. [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Of course I'm worried about similar problems in the United States. We can not allow refugees to enter this country unless we can adequately vet them and we know we can't. Therefore we should stop allowing refugees into this country. [applause] And by the way, we do not need to be lectured about why we're angry and frustrated and fearful because we've had an illegal immigration problem in this country for 25 years. [applause] And we have every right to be frustrated about the fact that politicians stand up in election after election after election and promise us to fix the problem and yet, it has never been fixed.I offer leadership that understands that actions speak louder than words, that results count. We must secure our border. We must fix our broken immigration system. We must enforce a pro-American immigration system that serves our interests, not the rest of the world. I understand what it takes to translate goals into results and that is what I will do as president of the United States. Of course, we should be worried, for heavens sakes.This administration has now told us they don't know who has overstayed a visa. This administration has told us they don't even bother to check Facebook or Twitter to find out who's pledging allegiance to jihadis. We can do better than this, citizens. We need to take our country back. [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Oh, it's a problem for so many reasons.First of all, it is yet another lawless executive order. You see, he doesn't like the fact that Congress has rejected his ideas twice on a bipartisan basis, so he's decided he just gets to override them.Sorry, Mr. President, not the way "The Constitution" works.Secondly [applause] secondly, he basically admitted in that speech that he hasn't been paying much attention to enforcing the laws we have. He said, gee, we need a few more FBI agents. That would have helped, perhaps, stop a tragedy here in South Carolina with Dylann Roof, a guy who clearly never should have been sold a gun.In other words, Mr. President, you're right, we need to enforce the laws we have. Let's enforce the laws we have. There are criminals running around with guns who shouldn't have them. We don't prosecute any of them. Less than 1 percent.But I want to go back to the technology issue for a moment, if I may, as well, because in this regard, I disagree with Senator Santorum. Look, I come from the technology industry and I can tell you there is one thing that bureaucracies don't know how to do. They do not know how to innovate.We have come seven generations of technology since 2011. We have bureaucracies that are incapable of bringing in that innovation.So, yes, there are some very specific things that we should ask the private sector to help us with, including making sure we have the latest and greatest in algorithms to search through all these databases so that we find terrorists before they attack us, not after it's too late.And, finally, when a president who understands technology in the Oval Office. Mrs. Clinton, actually, you cannot wipe a server with a towel. [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~We need to be very clear-eyed now about who are our allies and who are our adversaries. In the fight against ISIS, Saudi Arabia is our ally. Iran is our adversary. And despite Donald trump's bromance with Vladmir Putin, Vladmir Putin and Russia are our adversary. We can not [applause] we can not outsource leadership in the Middle East to Iran and Russia. We must stand and lead. The Kuwaitis, the Jordanians, the Saudis, Egyptians, Bahrainis, the Emirates, the Kurds. I know virtually all of these nations and their leaders. And they have asked us for very specific kinds of support: bombs, material, arms, intelligence.We are not providing any of it today. I will provide all of it. We have allies who will stand up and help us deny ISIS territory, which is what we must do to defeat them. We must deny them territory. They will help us do this. And yes, we need a coalition.But only in the United States of America can lead such a coalition. I will lead it. But we must be clear-eyed through this fight. Iran is our adversary. Russia is our adversary. We can never outsource our leadership. Only the United States of America can lead to defeat ISIS. I will. [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, thank you. Good evening. If I may begin by saying how honored I am to be standing here with two former Iowa Caucus winners.Governor, Senator.And how honored I am to be talking with all of you. You know, I'm not a political insider. I haven't spent my lifetime running for office. The truth is I have had and been blessed by a lot of opportunities to do a lot of things in my life.And unlike another woman in this race, I actually love spending time with my husband. [laughter and applause]I'm standing here because I think we have to restore a citizen government in this country. I think we have to end crony capitalism. The crony capitalism that starts with both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.You know, Hillary Clinton sits inside government and rakes in millions, handing out access and favors. And Donald Trump sits outside government and rakes in billions buying people like Hillary Clinton.The state of our economy is not strong. We have record numbers of men out of work. We have record numbers of women living in poverty. We have young people who no longer believe that the American dream applies to them.We have working families whose wages have stagnated for decades, all while the rich get richer, the powerful get more powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected get more connected.Citizens, it's time to take our country back. [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Yes, and see
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~[laughing] Yes, I did.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~And, I've bought more weapons at them, and you fill out forms. The President also says things that it's easier to get a gun now than it is to grow trees. Again, I purchase guns, and I can assure you that it is much more difficult to purchase a firearm than it is to get the ingredients of a salad at the supermarket.What the President keeps pushing are ideas that have never worked. Ideas that would not have stopped San Bernadino, Sandy Hook, Aurora, and at some point you wonder if you keep retrying things that don't work, maybe we should just see if we could resell all those used lottery tickets that didn't work real well because that's the logic of just keep doing the same thing, but something that has failed. Of course, we want to stop gun violence, but the one common thing that has happened in most mass shootings is that they happened in gun- free zones where people who would have been law abiding citizens, who could have stood up and at least tried to stop it and we're not allowed to under the law. [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~I wish I saw the country in the same place that the president presented it to be the other night in the State of the Union. He talked about how great the economy was doing. And I guess for the people he hangs out with, it's probably doing great.But the president should've stood in the line at the layaway counter at Walmart just before Christmas. He would have heard a very different story about the economy of America.I wish I could introduce him the lady who cleans the building where our campaign headquarters is located in Little Rock. Her name is Kathleen. She works all day at a local hospital cleaning, and then she goes to the building where a bank, and our headquarters, and other offices are she spends another seven hours. She works 15 hours a day.I guarantee you she's not working 15 hours a day because she loves scrubbing toilets, and sweeping floors. She's working that many hours because that's what it takes for her to make it work.And, she's not alone. There are people all over this country who are working like that. Many of them working two jobs &mdash; and they used to have one job, and that would take care of them. But, because of wage stagnation, which we've had for 40 years, because the fact that they're punished for working harder if they work that many hours. The government gets more of their second shift than they do.And, as a result there are a lot of people who are hurting today. I wish the President knew more of them. He might make a change in the economy and the way he's managing it. [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~It does not shut down international commerce, but it may slow it down. And, you don't want to slowdown commerce that is making us safer. It's worth it. This lady who came and joined with the San Bernardino killer had passed three background checks, and that's why a lot of Americans didn't buy it when the President said we'll bring in Syrian refugees, but don't worry we'll check them out.We have a lot of confidence in a president who told us that we could keep our doctor, we could keep our health insurance, and cost us less, and now the latest is if you like your gun you can keep it too, and frankly, we don't buy it. We don't believe it. He's lost his credibility, and his inept  [applause] inability to work with Congress and pass legislation has led him to do what I never even imagined doing as a governor, and that's just going and doing it my own way.That's why we elect a president, is to lead, is to be able to shepherd things through. And if I can do it with a 90 percent Democrat legislature in Arkansas, there is no excuse for any president not being able to lead in Washington if he knows what the heck he is doing when he gets there. [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Let me go back to the reason so many people are having a hard time getting ahead. The tax system punishes them.Think about this. If you work really hard and you start moving up the economic ladder, you get bumped into a different tax bracket. So the government thinks it deserves more of your hard work than you do.And it's one of the reasons that no matter how many different reforms you have to a tax on people's productivity, you're still taxing their work, their savings. You're taxing their capital gains, inheritance, dividends, you're taxing everything that produces something.And it's way I really believe it's time to do something bold, not something minute. This is no time for a tap of the hammer, a twist of the screwdriver. It's time for something big. That's why the fair tax transforms our economy. [applause]And we don't punish workers. It's the only way we're going to get middle class people moving ahead again, because the harder they work, the more they keep. No payroll tax deducted from their checks. They get their entire paycheck. [applause]And, one of the most important parts, it's built on the common sense with which we raised our kids, and trained dogs. You reward behavior you want more of. And, you punish behavior you want less of. That's how I raise kids, it's how I trained our dogs, and folks, it's not that difficult.We now punish the behavior we say we want more of by taxing it, and we reward the behavior that we say we want less of, so if you make a good investment, we punish you with a tax. If you make a bad investment you can write that off and the rest of the taxpayers will help subsidize you, and bail you out. [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Let me put that in context. When I went to Afghanistan, I saw a land that looked like the land of the Flintstones. It was desolate. It was barren. It was primitive.And it's been that way for thousands of years. They want to take the world back to be just like that.We don't.We need to make a clear goal as to why we want to be anywhere in the Middle East, and I'll tell you why we want to be and need to be, is to destroy radical Islam and everything that threatens civilization. It's not just a threat [applause] to Israel or to America, it's a threat to every civilized person on this Earth. And we need to be equipping not only the Kurds in Iraq, we need to be making sure that those who are willing to fight radical Muslims will do it, but we need to never ever spend a drop of American blood unless there is a clearly defined goal and we can't make sure we win unless we have a military that's the strongest in the history of mankind.We've got to rebuild our navy. It's the smallest navy we've had since 1915, when my grandfather got on a destroyer in World War I when he was in the U.S. Navy. We've got young men in Air Force B-52s, one in particular, he's flying a B-52 that his father flew in the '80s and his grandfather flew in the '50s. Those planes are older than me.We've got to have a military that the world is afraid of, use it sparingly, but when we do, the whole world will know that America is on their tail and they will be on their tail on the ground, never ever to rise up again. [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Only if there is a concerted effort to destroy the advance of radical Islamists who are against us. As far as what are we going to make it look like. Frankly, I don't know what we can make it look like. You can't create for other people a desire for freedom and democracy.And frankly, that is not the role of the United States. The role of the United States military is not to build schools, it is not to build bridges, it is not to go around and pass out food packets.It is to kill and destroy our enemy and make America safe and that is the purpose we should be there if we're going to be there.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, first of all, let's just remember that Social Security is not the government's money, it belongs to the people who had it taken out of their checks involuntarily their entire working lives. [applause]For the government to say, well it is fault of working people that we have a Social Security problem, no. It is the fault of a government that used those people's money for something other than protecting those people's accounts. So let's not blame them and punish them. [applause]But here is a fact, and I sometimes hear Republicans say well, we're going to have to cut this and extend the age. You know what I think a lot of times when I hear people say, well, let's make people work to their 70. That sounds great for white-collar people who sat at a desk most of their lives. You ever talk to somebody that stood on concrete floor for the first 40 years of their working life? Do you think they can stand another five years or 10 years, many of them will retired virtually crippled because they worked hard. And we're going to punish them some more? I don't think so. Here's the fact. [applause]Four percent economic growth, we fully fund Social Security and Medicare. Our problem is not that Social Security is just too generous to seniors. It isn't. Our problem is that our politicians have not created the kind of policies that would bring economic growth.And I still support strongly that we get rid of the 77,000 pages of the monstrous tax code [applause] pass the fair tax, supercharge this economy with the rocket fuel that happens with the consumption tax and we don't have to cut Social Security to any senior who has worked their lifetime for it. [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, Rick, I'm pretty sure I did also fight the Clinton machine because every election I was ever in in Arkansas, I assure you, they were behind it, helping finance and campaign for every opponent.And I share with you the understanding that it's going to be a tough battle. But I spent the first half of my adult life in the private and nonprofit sector, raising a family, understanding how tough it is for people to make it.And that first half of my life is what led me to believe that America needs a different kind of leadership, not people who spent their whole life running from one office to the next, and living off the government dime. And I got involved because I got sick of what I saw.I also believe that there's got to be some leadership that not only addresses the monetary and military issues of this country, but the moral issues of this country. At the end of every political speech, most of us say, God bless America.But how can he do that when we continue to slaughter 4,000 babies a day? [applause]And I want to be the president that treats every person, including the unborn, as a person. And protect them under the 5th and 14th amendments of the constitution. I close with this word from a gentleman in East Texas named Butel Lucre. He's 100 years old and I met him down in East Texas. And he said this to me. "I sure wish, Mike, we had the days when The Ten Commandments were in all of our capitals and in every school, and we prayed again.You know, he may be 100 years old, but I believe some of those old ideas to get this country back where we unapologetically get on our knees before we get on our feet might be the best solutions we've ever sought as a country. [applause] And I ask for your support and your vote.Thank you. [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, we shouldn't be and that's one of the reasons that I think there a lot of voices in our country who are saying it's time to relook at the visa program. The European Union is a failure, it's not allowed for even the economic goals that they were trying to achieve.But, what we're not seeing is that it's making Europe less safe, and it's proven not to be exactly what they all thought it was going to be.Our first and foremost responsibility in this country, and the first responsibility of the President of the United States is protect America, and protect Americans. We have a President who seems to be more interested in protecting the reputation and image of Islam than he is protecting us. And, I want to be very clear [applause] that this President. [cheering]Makes comments like he did the other night, that we have to be so careful because we don't want to offend Muslims. He needs to read his own FBI crime stats from last year which would show him that of the hate crimes in the country, over 5,500, about 1,100 were religious hate crimes. And, of those, 58% were directed toward Jews. Only 16% directed toward Muslims.Maybe what the President should have talked about the other night is how we ought to be more careful in the anti-semitic comments that are going toward American Jews than toward Muslims because by three times as many [applause] they're being targeted for religious hate crime.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, why don't we start by making sure the Justice Department never does an idiotic program like Fast and Furious where the U.S. Government put guns [cheering] in the hands of Mexican drug lords [applause] and end up killing one of our border agents. You know, they want to talk about law abiding citizens, I just find it amazing the President keeps saying the gun show loophole. There is no gun show loophole. I promise you I've been to more gun shows than President Obama.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~I would just say that if we were doing a better job within the government, we wouldn't need the private sector to do the things that we're asking them to do. [applause]I've had a little experience in this in the private sector myself. And what I found was a government with layers and layers of bureaucracy, of people who had some technical expertise but they had no authority, number one.And one of the things I found out about in the bureaucracy is if a lot of people have authority, nobody has authority, number one. And number two, that if you don't do anything, you don't get fired.It's only when you do something and something goes wrong, you get fired. So they do nothing. And that's what is happening in our Defense Department right now. We have a capability that they're trying to develop to play defense.We have a lot of technologists that are very skilled. And they're trying to figure out how to play defense. But what we don't have is we don't have folks who are thinking about offense.We don't have war-fighters. We have technologists. Technologists are not war-fighters. Technologists are thinking, how do I protect cyber-security, how do I secure, how do I protect? And we need to have a much more dynamic, how do we &mdash; how do we go after them? How do we respond?And we need leadership that's willing to make sure that when someone attacks us &mdash; and ladies and gentlemen, they're attacking us as we speak. They're attacking us all day every day, not just the government, but they're attacking private sector companies all day every day.They have to learn that we're going to pay &mdash; they're going to pay a price when they do so.And then right now, just like in every other aspect of our national security, people who attack us are not paying a price. We need a leader who will make sure that they know when they mess with America, they're going to pay a price.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Ladies and gentlemen, America is frustrated and angry and looking for someone who's a fighter, but I also think they're looking for someone who's a winner. Somebody who can go out there and take on the establishment and make a difference. And take on someone who's going to be the person who's going to be between a Republican holding the presidency and that's Hillary Clinton.And there's one person on this stage, one person in the race who's done it and done it repeatedly. I've taken on Hillary Clinton on the issues you care about. Partial-birth abortion.Go and google Rick Santorum and Hillary Clinton and there you'll see a five-minute debate. I'll let you decide who won the debate. I'll tell you who won, because we passed the bill and I know I'm out of time but I'm going to take some of Rand Paul's time here for a second. [applause]If you're looking for someone who fought Hillary Clinton on Iran's sanctions, she was one of four who voted &mdash; who's deciding vote who voted against Iran's sanctions, so we didn't get it in place as earlier as we should have.I've fought battles against her. In 1994, I ran against the Clinton machine. James Carville and Paul Begala, ran the race against me when I took on the author of Hillary care.And each one of those battles, I won. You want a fighter, you want a winner, I'd appreciate your vote. Thank you. [applause]
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Look, Facebook and Twitter can teach us things. We can cooperate with them. We can share ideas and information. But this is a &mdash; and this is a very dicey area for the government to go in and require the industry to do its job.It needs to develop that capability. We need to be &mdash; have responsible dialogue, but I don't think requirements are the order of the day.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, all he has to do is listen to the Democratic debate and find out how bad the economy is. All they do is complain about the hollowing out of the middle of America, and how America is struggling so badly, and have to make these radical changes in Washington.But they've been in control for the last seven years, and what have we seen? The most important jobs, I believe, in this country are the ones that fill the middle. For the 74% of Americans who don't have a college degree between the age of 25 and 65 are manufacturing jobs. Your governor, and your legislature, and your team here have done an amazing job of bringing manufacturing jobs back to South Carolina. [applause and cheering]Right here. Right here in Charleston, right down in the street in Boeing. You've done a great job, and what's happened? You've grown this economy, you've strengthened the center of your state, the middle. That's because you know that if you're really going to create wealth and opportunity, you got to get jobs, and good paying jobs for everybody.And, so what's happened? Two million jobs, manufacturing jobs, have left this country because of Barack Obama. Regulations, EPA, workplace regulations, things driving people off-shore all because of his number one priority, global climate change.Well, let me tell you this, Mr. President. For every dollar of GDP, China creates five times as much pollution as we do here. You want to &mdash; lower global climate change, bring those jobs back to America and let American workers do that job with less pollution. [applause]
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, the historic promises that we have made to &mdash; to Iran in this agreement need to be torn up on the first day in office of the next president. [applause] And let me tell you why, because Iran has already torn it up. Iran has not approved the agreement that President Obama has said that they have approved. They have approved a different agreement in their parliament.The fact of the matter is they have violated this agreement. Carly just mentioned some of those violations.They have launched ballistic missiles, tested them, in clear violation.And here's the pathetic part. The president announced that they were going to impose sanctions. And then President Rouhani went on Twitter and said there would be retaliation.And what did we do?We backed down.Ladies and gentlemen, there are 50 some Citadel cadets in this audience tonight. [applause] I would ask them to stand up if they will. And here's what I want to tell each and every one of them, as you stand. Here's what I want to tell them. [applause] Whether it's you're watching that movie this weekend that just came out when we abandoned our men and women in Benghazi, or whether it's we treat Iran, that gave courtesies to our sailors, as they made them record a hostage video, let me tell you this, if you choose to serve this country, I will have your back. I will not let America be trampled upon anymore by these radical jihadists.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, the most devastating attack that could occur is an electromagnetic pulse attack, and that would be an attack that would be triggered by a nuclear explosion in the upper atmosphere of our country.The best way to stop that from happening is to make sure that those who contemplating and actually war-gaming and talking about using it, Iran, doesn't get a nuclear weapon so they can't explode that device. [applause] And the president of the United States has put Iran on a path to a nuclear weapon. And we have done nothing to do anything to harden our grid. There is actually a bill in Congress that would put money forward to try to put redundancy and harden our electric grid so it could actually survive an EMP.An EMP is a devastating explosion that sends a pulse that knocks out all electric, everything, everything that is connected to any kind &mdash; that is wired, that has a circuit board gets fried out. Everything is gone. Cars stop. Planes fall out of the sky.This is a devastating attack. And this president has done nothing, number one, to take the most probable person to &mdash; probable country to launch an attack and stop them, and has done nothing to try to defend us, particularly our electric grid. The bottom line is, I put the original sanctions on the Iranian nuclear program when I was in the United States Senate. I've been fighting for 12 years with one thing in mind, that we must stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. And [applause] because they're different than every other country. They do not want a nuclear weapon to defend themselves. They want a nuclear weapon to have theological ends to bring about their mahdi so they can control the world. And that is the most serious threat facing this country right now. [applause]
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, the numbers just don't add up. I mean, they have not added manufacturing jobs. Manufacturing jobs have been lost in this country, 2 million of them. The bottom line is that this president has done more to take jobs away from the hard-working people who are struggling the most.And that's folks who are, as I said, the 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree. And they're out there talking about, well, we're going to provide free college for everybody. Well, who is going to pay for it? The 74 percent that don't have a college degree.They're not &mdash; nobody is focused. Let's just be honest, nobody is focused on the people who are struggling the most in America today. We talk about immigration. Talk about the president's immigration plan. He wants to bring in more and more people into this country. Let people who are here illegally stay in this country.Almost all of the people who are here illegally, and most of the people who came here legally over the last 20 years, they're working in wage-earning jobs. That is why wages have flat-lined.And we have unfortunately two political parties with most of the candidates in this field for some form of amnesty, some form of allowing people to stay here even though they're here illegally and for increasing levels of legal immigration.I'm someone who believes that we need to be the party that stands for the American worker. And when we say we need to send people back, I mean we send people back.And let me just make one point. I was in Storm Lake, Iowa, the other day, near a Tyson's plant, 91 percent of the kids that go to the elementary school there are minority kids. And they said, well, what are you going to do with all of these people, their families, they've lived here for a long time?I said, I'm going to give them a gift. I'm going to give them a gift of being able to help the country they were born in. And I'm going to export America, the education they were able to see. They learned English language. They learned about capitalism. They learned about democracy. You want to stop flow of immigrants?Let's send six million Mexicans, Hondurans, Guatemalans, El Savadorians [bell rings] back into their country, so they can start a renaissance in their country so they won't be coming over here anymore. [applause]
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~You know, we've had this debate about the economy, and we haven't talked the one issue now increasingly even the right, and even the are coming to agreement. I've run around doing 300 town hall meetings talking about a book written by a liberal Harvard sociologist, not a normal thing for me to be talking about, but I now name Robert Putnam who wrote a book called, "Our Kids".And, he wrote this book, I think, ostensibly to support the Democratic argument that the middle of America's hollowing out, and income gap is widening, and rich are getting richer. When he studied all the information as to what was going on, he realized that the biggest reason that we're seeing the hollowing out of the middle of America is the breakdown of the American family.The reality is that if you're a single parent &mdash; a child of a single parent, and you grew up in a single parent family neighborhood, you went to that single parent family school, the chance of you ever, ever reaching the top 20% of income earners is 3% in America. At least &mdash; I don't know about you, but that's not good enough. And, we have been too politically correct in this country because we don't want to offend anybody to fight for the lives of our children. [applause]You want &mdash; You want to be shocked? You read the first few chapters of Mr. &mdash; Dr. Putnam' book. He talks about Port Clinton, Ohio and growing up there in the 1950's, and how poor kids actually survived and did well, even though they were poor and disadvantaged. But, then he goes to the towns today and these kids are failing, and failing miserably. They don't even have a shot, and we won't even have the courage to have leadership at the federal level &mdash; not with legislation, but the most powerful tool a president have, the bully pulpit to encourage each and everyone of you, churches and businesses, and educators, and community leaders to let's have a national campaign to rebuild the American family, and give every child its birthright which is a Mom and a Dad who loves them.That will change this economy.

Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~-- on that issue, there is no point for being cheaper Democrats, no point grabbing a second liberal party. It is time to get rid of the Republican Party, start over with a new one that's at least conservative. Give Harry Reid and Pelosi credit. At least they fight for what they believe in. I want senators and House members in DC to fight for what we believe in, as well. It's time to have Republican

Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~"  we can't get rid of Obamacare" -- Lindsey, let me answer this question now. I wish the Senate Republicans had half the fight in them the Senate Democrats did. Look, President Obama didn't give up on Obamacare when they lost the Senate election in Massachusetts. I want my side to follow the Constitution. They broke the Constitution, they broke the law, but they forced Obamacare down our throats, even when they didn't have 60 votes. I wish Republicans in D.C. had half the fight of the Senate Democrats to get rid of Obamacare, to defund Planned Parenthood. [applause] If we can't defund Planned Parenthood now, if we can't stand for innocent human life after these barbaric videos, it is time to be done with the Republican Party. We defunded them in Louisiana. Let's defund them in D.C. If we can't win
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~"We can't -- we can't "
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Absolutely. Look, the reality is, Hillary Clinton is gift-wrapping this election to us. They are running their weakest candidate. They have got a socialist that is gaining on Hillary Clinton. Folks, you can't make that up. A socialist is doing well in the Democratic primary. The best way for us to give this election back would be to nominate a Donald Trump. He'll implode in the general election, or if, God forbid, if he were in the White House, we have no idea what he would do. You can't just attack him on policy. He doesn't care about policy. It's not enough to say he was for socialized medicine or higher taxes
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Dana, that's not right. What I've said consistently is secure the border. I've said after that is done, the American people will deal with the folks that are here pragmatically and compassionately. Now, Rick, if he wants to say that Rubio, Senator Rubio, or Jeb or others are for amnesty, that's his right. I'm not for amnesty. I've never been for amnesty, will never be for amnesty. Secure the border. We don't need to do that as a comprehensive -- I've also said we need to put an end to sanctuary cities. It's not enough to defund them; I think we need to criminalize, accuse and jail those mayors and councilman as accessories  ( UNKNOWN ): Thank you, Governor.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~for the crimes committed by people who shouldn't be here in the first place. [applause]

Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Hi, I'm Bobby Jindal. Now, look, I don't have a famous last name. My daddy didn't run for president. I don't have a reality TV show. I'll tell you what I do have, I've got the backbone, I've got the bandwidth, I've got the experience to get us through these tough times, to make sure that we don't turn the American dream into the European nightmare. Thank you for having me today. [applause]
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I've got a practical question. I'd like the left to give us a list of jobs that Christians aren't allowed to have. If we're not allowed to be clerks, bakers, musicians, caterers, are we allowed to be pastors [inaudible]?
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I think actually putting Roberts, I think putting Kennedy, I think putting -- before them, I think putting Souter on the bench was a mistake. But look, I think the -- the first responsibility starts in the White House. The reality is conservatives have not been willing to stand up for our beliefs, unlike the liberals -- look, you never worry about where the Democratic judges are going to vote, it's always the conservatives. You've never had a Democratic judge wake up and say, surprise, I've evolved, I've become a conservative. It's always the Republicans, because we have presidents that try to find judges with no records, no rulings, no writings. I'll tell you, I am going to have a litmus test. For judges, I'm going to find judges that are conservative, judges that are going to be pro-life, judges that are going to follow "The Constitution," judges, by the way, that are going to follow the American law, not international law. They're not appointed there to interpret international law, they're there to apply "The United States Constitution." Judges understand, their job is not to write law. If they want to write law, they should run for the Senate or the House. It's time for a Republican president as the next commander in chief, I will do as the Democrats have done. I will appoint bold judges that are actually consistent with my values that will be conservatives and enforce the Senate --
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake -- Jake  [crosstalk]
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake, I'd like to answer that question.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake, I'm a doer, not a talker. Look, the idea of America is slipping away from us. If you want somebody who is going to manage the slow decline of this country, makes incremental changes, vote for somebody else. If you want to vote for somebody who understands what is at stake -- Planned Parenthood is selling baby parts across this country, and the Senate Republicans have already given up, even without a fight. I am tired of this surrender (ph) caucus, I am angrier at the Republicans in D.C. than I am at the president. The president is a socialist. At least he fights for what we believe in. We don't need to just send any Republican to the White House. We need to sent somebody who understands that it's time to make big changes. It's time to take on the establishment, it's time to take on the D.C. permanent governing class. Every Republican says they will shrink the size of the government. I'm the only one that has done it. Cut our budget 26 percent. If you want somebody that's going to make incremental change, vote for somebody else. It's time to get the idea of America back. At some point, we're going to be held -- we'll be asked, what did you do when the idea of America was slipping away? I'll promise you this. I will give every ounce of blood, energy, sweat I've got to save the idea of America, the greatest country in the history of the world. [applause]
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake, I've got a practical question.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake, look, America's the most compassionate country in the entire world. We do more for folks around this world, and that's the nature of the American people. Two things. One, let us draw line, a direct line, between this refugee crisis, and this president's failed foreign policy. Jake, look, America is the most compassionate country in the entire world. We do more for folks around this world. And that's the nature of the American people. Two things: one, let us draw a line, a direct line between this refugee crisis and this president's failed foreign policy. He drew a red line in Syria and did not enforce it and now we're seeing millions of refugees potentially, hundreds of thousands going into Europe. The answer is not to put a Band-aid on this and allow even more people to come into America. We should not short-circuit; we have got a vetting process, we've got a normal refugee process. Simply allowing more into our country doesn't solve this problem. The way to solve this problem is for us to be clear to our friends and allies that we're going to replace Assad, we're going to hunt down and destroy ISIS; our friends don't trust us, our enemies don't fear and respect us. But I want to go back on immigration. Let me be very clear. Immigration, we need to insist on assimilation in immigration. My parents came here legally almost 45 years ago. They came here, they followed the rule of law. They knew English, they adopted the values. They didn't come here to be hyphenated Americans. They're not Indian Americans. They're not Asian Americans. They're --
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Lindsey
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Lindsey, well, that's my frustration. [applause] Listen to what you've heard. You -- you basically heard a Senate Republican say, "We can't defund Planned Parenthood, despite these barbaric videos."
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Look, absolutely. We need to do whatever is necessary to hunt down and kill these radical Islamic terrorists but this president has helped -- his policies have helped to contribute to this problem. He went to the Pentagon the same week they announced they were cutting back the number of troops in the Army to say that we're not going to win this through guns, it's going to be a change of hearts and minds. This will be a generational conflict, that is nonsense. These are barbarians. They are burning, crucifying people alive, Christians and other Muslims. We need to hunt them down and --
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~No. And it's not only whether they can win. They shouldn't win this election cycle. One of the things I do agree -- and I want to thank Donald Trump after I've criticized him for everything from being a narcissist to an egomaniac -- one of the things he was right about was to say nonsense to the D.C. establishment. It is time to fire all of them. You've got a choice between honest Socialists on the Left, like Bernie Sanders, and lying conservatives on the Right. We have got the majority; what good has it done us? See, they said they were going to stop amnesty. They said they were going to repeal ObamaCare. They didn't do either. Now they're not even willing to fight to defund Planned Parenthood. They've already -- McConnell has already waved the white flag of defeat. They are not willing to stand up to fight for the issues that count. I think it is time to have term limits. I think it's time to have part-time citizen legislators. Let's pay them a per diem instead of a six-figure salary, stop them from being seven-figure lobbyists. Let's also pay them a per diem for every day they don't go to D.C. Let's keep them out of D.C., working in the real -- [crosstalk]   -- let's make them live under the same rules and laws they apply to the rest of us. Not only shouldn't they be elected, they can't be elected. Let's fire all of them from their current positions. [applause]
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Sure, I don't think a 14-year-old should ever get arrested for bringing a clock to school. So, if you're asking me I'm glad he wasn't -- he was released. I'm glad that police are careful. I'm glad they are worried about security and safety issues. Look, in America we don't tolerate them. The biggest discrimination is going on against Christian business owners and individuals who believe in traditional forms of marriage. They are throwing this woman in jail in Kentucky. [applause] Let's talk about that. Let's talk about the Christian florist, the caterer, the musician, who simply want to say, don't arrest us for having -- or don't discriminate against us, don't shut down our businesses, don't fine us thousands of dollars for believing marriage is between a man and a woman. Lets talk about not discriminating against Christians.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Thank you, Jake. [applause]
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Thank you, Jake. But look, it's not a minor ruling. Justice Roberts twice rewrote the law to save ObamaCare, the biggest expansion of government, creating a new entitlement when we can't afford the government we've got today, an expansion of socialism in our country. It's not that he got a minor ruling wrong. This is twice he rewrote the law. Now, look, I have a lot of respect for these senators that have big bladders. They give great speeches in the Senate. And I respect that. I've actually signed the executive order. I've actually signed a law protecting religious liberty in the state of Louisiana. It's not 99-1. The one that he got wrong was a big one. Twice he bent over backwards to save ObamaCare. If the Republicans had voted the way that we should -- they should have, we would still have our 19th Amendment rights and ObamaCare would not be the law of the land.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Two things, Jake. One, I'm absolutely for all of these carve-outs and loopholes and special interests for as -- they get lobbyists. They get sweetheart deals you and I and the rest of this audience couldn't get. So as part of an overall comprehensive tax reform that has a lower, flatter tax code, sure. As a single, I am just to raise taxes, no. I don't want to give the government more money. The government has grown over this president where now, it's going to overwhelm the American economy. We've got to cut the size of the government economy. Nobody else running for president has done that. I'm the only candidate. I've cut my state budget 26 percent. Everybody else talks about it, we have done it. So, there's a part of overall tax reform that cuts rates, flattens and lowers the tax code, sure. But I'm not for raising taxes on anybody. We already have too much money going to D.C.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~We're not allowed to be elected officials. I firmly -- this is an important point. The First Amendment rights, the right to religious freedom is in the First Amendment of "The Constitution." It isn't breaking the law to exercise our constitutional rights. America did not create religious liberty, religious liberty created the United States of America. It is the reason we're here today. [applause]
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~We -- it is important we insist on that in immigration going --
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, Jake, I'm in compliance with the 11th Commandment, and I would tell my fellow Republicans, let's stop treating Donald Trump like a Republican. If he were really a conservative  [applause] If he were really a conservative and 30 points ahead, I would endorse him. He's not a conservative. He's not a liberal. He's not a Democrat. He's not a Republican. He's not an independent. He believes in Donald Trump. Here is the reality, the idea of America is slipping away. Eighteen trillion dollars of debt, Planned Parenthood selling baby parts across our country. Our government is creating a new entitlement program, when we can't afford the government we've got today. We've got a president who won't even say the words radical Islamic terrorism. He has declared war on trans fats and a truce with Iran. Think about that. He's more worried about Twinkies than he is about the ayatollahs having a nuclear weapon. [applause] That's what is happening, the idea of America is slipping away. We must not let that happen on our watch. We have a once in a lifetime opportunity to rescue the idea of America, the choice for conservatives. Do we depend on proven conservative principles like Ronald Reagan did, or do we turn this over to a narcissist who only believes in himself
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, Jake, I want to answer that question. I want to go back to Iran. I didn't get a chance to answer that as well. Look, on Russia, across the world, dictators walk all over this president. He treats our friends like dirt. He lets our enemies walk all over us. The only group he's able to out-negotiate are the Senate Republicans. They never should've passed this bad Corker bill. Instead of a two-thirds vote to reject -- to approve the Iran deal, now it takes a two-thirds vote to reject the Iran deal. I want to ask Lindsey a question. Will the Senate Republicans -- they still have time -- are they willing to use the nuclear option, meaning get rid of the filibusters, stop Iran from becoming a nuclear power? Now is the time for the Senate Republicans to stand up and fight. We are tired of the establishment saying there's nothing we can do. [applause] All night tonight, we've heard Republicans say things like, "Well, if the Supreme Court's ruled, there's nothing I can do about religious liberty," you know. "The president did this. There's nothing we can do about it for two more years." There is something we can do. We won the Senate. We won the House. What was the point of winning those chambers if we're not going to do anything with them? You're going back tonight. You still have time before the Thursday deadline. Will y'all use the nuclear option to stop Iran from becoming a nuclear power? [applause]
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, Jake, look, I think the American people -- we don't discriminate anybody based on the color of their skin or their creed. I think the way you strike that balance, you say to Muslim leaders, they have got two responsibilities. One, it's not enough to denounce just simply generic acts of violence. They have got to denounce the individuals by name, and say these are not martyrs. These terrorists are not martyrs; rather, they are going straight to hell. They are not going to enjoy a reward in their afterlife. Secondly, they have to explicitly embrace the same freedoms for everybody else they want for themselves. Look, I know it's politically incorrect to say this, the president says Fort Hood was an issue of workplace violence. We are at war with radical Islam. Our president loves to apologize for America, he goes to the National Prayer Breakfast, brings up the Crusades, criticizes Christians. We're at war today with radical Islamic extremists. It's not politically correct to say that, but the way you strike that balance, you say to Muslim leaders, denounce these fools, these radical terrorists by name, say they are not martyrs.
Bobby Jindal~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Yeah, I wanted to clarify -- I want to make very clear that everybody understands my position is, we need to secure the border, period. Any talk of doing any more -- we don't need a comprehensive plan, don't need an 1,000-page bill, like the Gang of Eight. We don't need amnesty. Everybody in D.C. talks about it. We need to get it done. As president, I'll get it done in six months. It won't be perfect, but we can get it done. I'm not for amnesty. We do need to secure the border. A smart immigration makes our -- our country stronger. Right now, we've got a weak one. One of the things I've said -- I know the left -- I know Hillary didn't like this -- immigration without assimilation is invasion. We need to insist the people who come here come here legally, learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work. We do need to secure the border. [applause]

George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~103-47. I got them to support a conservative agenda. If I get elected president, I will make things work in Washington.

George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~But there's a huge difference between an individual standing up and saying I am going to stand for my religious freedom and my religious rights. I applaud that. This is America. You should be able to engage in your religious belief in the way you see fit. But when you are an elected official and you take an oath of office to uphold the law, all the laws, you cannot pick and choose or you no longer have a society that depends on the rule of law.

George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~He's not going to be the nominee, Hugh. And let me just say one word here. This is an important election with an enormous number of challenges facing the American people. And the first four questions are about Donald Trump. [crosstalk]
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~He's not going to be the nominee.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I don't -- I don't think that we should tell that child born in America that we're going to send them back. The way to avoid that is to have an intelligent immigration policy where we know who is coming here, why they are coming here, so we don't have this flood of people coming here for the wrong reasons.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I think there are two things, Jake. Two things that we need as Republicans. First, we have to win the election. You're going to hear a lot of great ideas, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that. None of it matters unless you win the election. And the second is, once you win, you have to be able to govern successfully. You've heard a lot of fighting back and forth, you didn't get this done, you didn't get that done. That's the way Washington is today. You have to have a leader, a president, who will actually get a conservative agenda through. I'm running because I have done both those things, and I did them in one of the most liberal states in America. I got elected three times in the state of New York. Twice by the largest pluralities ever for a Republican. I ran as a Republican conservative. If I get the nomination, I will be able to get broad support and win this election, and take the White House back for our party. But more importantly, once I've won, I will put in place a sweeping conservative agenda. I did that in New York. Over $143 billion in tax cuts. More than the other 49 states combined. Taking one million people off welfare and putting them into jobs, in a state where the Democrats control the state assembly.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I would throw out the entire corrupt tax code. [applause] It's a symbol of the corruption and the power of the lobbyists and the special interests in Washington. It is 74,000 pages of incomprehensible gobbledygook. What I would do is get rid of the 1.4 million every year in exemptions and loopholes, dramatically lower the rates. The normal American person is paying higher taxes than they should because of loopholes, and one of them is that carried interest loophole. I would tax that income the same as ordinary income. I'd lower the rate to 24 percent for all Americans, but I would not give a special break to the Wall Street fat caps -- fat cats.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~If we're going to make this America
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Imagine one minute -- Jake, imagine one minute that was a Muslim who said I don't believe in gay marriage, and refused to perform that wedding. We wouldn't have had that outrage. There's a place where religion supersedes the rule of law. It's called Iran. It shouldn't be the United States.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~It's hard for me to say I'm with Donald trump on anything, but on this issue, I agree with him. But let me just make one other point. It's not just throwing out the tax code to break the back of the special interests that control Washington. It's other reforms. I would propose a law -- right now there are over 400 former members of the House and Senate who are registered lobbyists in Washington. I would propose a law on day one, you serve one day in the House or Senate, there's a lifetime ban on you ever being a lobbyist in Washington, D.C. You get elected, you go back home. You don't stay and support the special interests. [applause]
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake, if I can comment on this. Yes, Kim Davis is different from Islamist radicalists from the Middle East. But on the other hand, we have run rule in America, an elected official can't say I'm not going to follow that law if it conflicts with my beliefs. I think she should have been fired and if she worked for me, I would have fired her. We have to uphold the rule of law. [applause]
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Lindsey, let me comment on this. Last week was the anniversary of September 11th and I was governor of New York on September 11th and led us through that horrible day. And I learned that we cannot assume that because radical Islam is a continent away, it doesn't pose a threat to us here in America. It did then, and today, I think, we are at greater risk of an attack than at any time since. We have got to destroy ISIS's ability to attack us here. But it's not 10,000 troops. It's not 20,000 troops. In my view, it's three things. First, we have to directly arm those fighting ISIS on the ground now. The Kurds
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~My response is kind of, "Wow." You know, we're going to have a president who defies the Supreme Court because they don't agree?
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~No, I will vote for the Republican nominee. But let me say this flat out, Donald Trump is unfit to be president of the United States or the Republican Party's nominee. Look at what he did in Atlantic City. He says he's going to make America great again? He invested four casinos in Atlantic City and he said, essentially, I'm going to make Atlantic City great again. Every one of those casinos went bankrupt. Over 5,000 Americans lost their job. And you know people who, in this difficult economic time, have lost their job and the pain that causes. He didn't lose anything, 5,000 lost their jobs. He will do for America what he did for Atlantic City and that is not someone we will nominate.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~No, I would not vote for Hillary Clinton.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~No, I would not. I would keep that deduction. I would lower the rates dramatically, so, yes, that root that has a special carve out would pay more, but everybody else is going to pay less. I would keep the home mortgage deduction, the charitable deduction, and others. And, by the way, you know, I agree with Rick on manufacturing, but my approach is different. I would pass a rate on manufacturing of 12 percent, the lowest in the developed world so we can make this America again. I know how important those jobs are. When I work -- went through college, Christmas and summer vacations, I worked in a factory. My grandparents worked in a factory. We have the opportunity now with lower energy costs, with the world labor cost getting higher, to make things in America so we don't have to worry about China. Lower the tax burden on manufacturing, improve the work skills
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~No. Hugh, not at all. I have not broken the pledge because Donald Trump is not going to be the Republican nominee, period, flat out, I guarantee you that. I would vote
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Not on the table but I think there's a lot that does work. And that is to have a strong America, a strong military and a resolve where the Iranians know that not only are we going to reject this deal on day one and reimpose sanctions but, if they move forward with the nuclear program, their safety for those facilities will be at risk. I'll tell you a couple of things I'd do. I'd give the Israelis bombs called MOPs, massive ordnance penetrators. Give them to Israel. Let the Iranians know we're prepared to work with Israel to make sure they never have a nuclear weapon. And let me point out that Hillary Clinton, supporting this deal, she was the senator from New York on September 11th, she saw what happened at the hands of radical Islam. This is the senator who did the reset program with Russia, who allowed the Middle East to deteriorate to flames, who has lied about Benghazi and is now supporting the Iranian deal. That's the opponent we're going to have next November. We have got to win this election. Everything we say is wonderful. But we have to win and, once we win, we have to actually do what we say. I can do this.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~of Americans. Get rid of job killing regulations. If we're going to
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~OK. All right. Thank you.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Thank you, Jake. Hi, I'm George Pataki, and I am honored to be here this afternoon with all of you at the Reagan Library. You know, when I think of Ronald Reagan, I think of his tremendous smile, a smile that reflected his optimism and his unending belief and faith in America and in Americans. And it was that belief in America that led to a great presidency, a presidency that led to decades of safety, security and prosperity for America. That's exactly the type of leadership we need in Washington today and that's why I'm running for President of the United States. Thank you. [applause]
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Thank you.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~The -- the elected representatives of the people always have the opportunity to change that law. The Supreme Court makes a determination, but it's ultimately the elected officials who decide whether or not that would be accepted. By the way, if I have a chance to lead this country, I will appoint judges who understand their role. They're not going to be making the law; they're going to be interpreting law that the elected officials passed.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Then you don't have the rule of law
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~We have to deal with the people who are here illegally. We can't just ignore them, or send them back. I think my policy would work to give them legal status, make them a part of an economy that will grow, and help America.  TAPPER:  I want to turn to another pressing immigration issue. Governor Jindal, over the next year, at least 10,000 Syrian refugees will be allowed to enter the United States. Governor Jindal, you've said it's ridiculous for America to let more refugees in from Syria, and you've expressed concerns about security. Senator Graham says that the United States has a moral obligation to these Syrian refugees. Governor Jindal, does the United States have any obligation to them?
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~working in a school, and then they could have legal
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Yeah, it's a small part of a very important issue, and let me comment on what my colleagues were saying here. We all agree you have to secure the border. We have to make sure that people come to America legally. That has got to be step one. Step two is, we have to stop releasing criminals into the communities. If you are charged with a crime as an illegal alien, you should either be in jail or be deported. You should not released, as the Obama administration has done. Of course, we should outlaw sanctuary cities and hold them responsible. But we can't ignore 11 million people who are here. What are we going to do? We're not going to send them back, despite somebody saying we're going to drag kids out of classrooms and send them back. But we have to send a message that we are a nation that depends on the rule of law, and when your first act is to break the law, there has to be a consequence. So what I would do is require those who want to have legal status, not citizenship, come forward, acknowledge they broke the law, and if they do it again, they can be immediately deported, and then do what we do in communities across America when we want to sanction someone
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Yes, I -- I didn't agree with the Supreme Court's decision, but it is the law of this land. And I am a great admirer of Martin Luther King. And he was prepared to break the law. But it wasn't in an office of political power. It was civil disobedience, where what he was willing to do is voluntarily go to jail with his followers to send a message to the elected representatives that these laws were wrong and had to be changed. And because of his courage, we didn't ignore the courts, we changed the laws and made America a better place. That's the way to do it.
George Pataki~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Yes?
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~-- and if we don't get on with this, they are coming here.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~-- does that include American ground forces in Syria as part of a regional army? Are all of you willing to commit to American ground forces going into Syria as part of a regional army to destroy the caliphate and its headquarters?
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~-- I could win this war without more American ground forces in Iraq and Syria, I would tell you, but we can't
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~-- the Republican Party in a position
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~-- to win. That's what I'm trying to do. And that does matter to me [inaudible]
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~[applause] In my world, hispanics are Americans
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~and if the war in Syria continues, it is coming here. For God's sakes, let's get on with
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~And if you are on one, I want to know what you're doing.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Are Americans
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Are you going to shut the government
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Are you going to shut the government down?
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Bobby, you were in the Congress, and all I can tell you, to everybody here, if you want to repeal Obamacare, get a new president. If you want to defund Planned Parenthood, elect a pro-life president, because that's the only way. If we pass the Cardin bill, Graham, Menendez, it would go to the president. He would veto it. 67 votes are required to override the veto.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Can I just say something? [applause] You know, Bobby, we're running to be president of the United States, the most important job in the free world. With it comes a certain amount of honesty. I'm tired of telling people things they want to hear that I know we can't do. He is not going to sign a bill that would defund ObamaCare. If I am president of the United States, I wouldn't put one penny in -- in my budget for Planned Parenthood, not one penny. I'm as offended by these videos as you are. But the one thing I'm not going to do going into 2016 is shut the government down and tank our ability to win. What you're saying and what Senator Cruz is saying, I am really sick of hearing, trying to get the bottom
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Compared to what we're doing
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Do you think Putin would be in the Ukraine or Syria today if Ronald Reagan were president? No. This is what happens when you have a weak, unqualified commander- in-chief who doesn't understand the role America plays in the world. Why is it bad for you that Russia's helping Assad? He's the magnet for Sunni extremists. The Syrian people are not going to accept him as their legitimate leader. By Assad being helped by Russia, it means the war never ends. It means the next 9/11, which is most likely to occur from an attack from Syria. It's more likely. At the end of the day, if I'm president of the United States, I've told you what I'm going to do. There's nobody left in Syria to train. We're going to get a regional army who doesn't like ISIL, who won't accept Assad, because he's a puppet of Iran. We're going in the ground, and we're going to destroy the caliphate, pull it up by roots, and we're going to hold the territory. This is a slap in a face from Putin to Kerry and Obama. Assad must go. If he doesn't go, this war never ends
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~George W. Bush
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Have you ever thought why all of us say that
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~He's one of the most qualified men to ever come before the United States Senate and I don't agree with his decision, but 99 times out of 100, I will. To the Republicans, the biggest prize on the table in 2017 is the presidency. If it is Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders, they are going to pick people that we will disagree with all the time. Please understand, we have to win this election. The court's at stake. It is the most important reason for us to turn out, to make sure we don't lose the judiciary for decades to come. [applause]
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Hispanics
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~How many democrats did you have on your bill?
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~How many democrats support yourplan
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I'm saying this, if they don't understand that Barack Obama's policies are not working, that we're not going to destroy ISIL in Iraq and Syria from the air, they are not ready. What have I learned in 35 trips? I learned what works and what doesn't. We were in a good spot in Iraq, President Bush made mistakes but he adjusted. To those who fought in Iraq, you did your job and Barack Obama wasted it all. Now we're in a spot where, if we don't destroy ISIL soon, they are coming here. There are 3,500 American boots on the ground. You would never know it, hearing your president, but we need about 10,000 to turn the tide of battle in Iraq. Then there is nobody left, Dana, to train inside of Syria. We spent $50 million training 54 people and they are down to four or five. They have been slaughtered. So we're going to need a regional army, the turks, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians get their armies up together and 90 percent of it will be them. They're going to pay for this war because we paid for the last two. But 10 percent at least will have to be us and we're going in on the ground and we're going to pull the caliphate up by its roots and we're going to kill every one of these bastards we can find because, if we don't, they are coming here. [applause]
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I've been called a lot of things but never elite before. My dad owned a liquor store, a bar and a poolroom. So only in America can you go from the back of a liquor store to being an elite.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I can tell you. None.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I have a little different take on where the country is going on this issue. Number one, in 1950, there were 16 workers for every retiree. How many are there today? There's three. In 20 years, there's going to be two, and you're going to have 80 million baby boomers like me retiree in mass wanting a Social Security check, and their Medicare bills paid. We're going to need more legal immigration. Let's just make it logical. Let's pick people from all over the world on our terms, not just somebody from Mexico. Let's create a rational, legal immigration system because we have a declining workforce.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I introduced her at a conference about Africa. I thought Secretary Clinton did a good job when it came to dealing with our problems in Africa, particularly among women. George W. Bush set $40 billion aside and Rick Santorum helped him and President Bush wiped out an entire -- wiped out AIDS and malaria for an entire generation of young African children. Secretary Clinton -- [applause]   -- Secretary Clinton did a good -- here's my problem with Secretary Clinton. Where the hell were you on the night of the Benghazi attack? How did you let it become a death threat to begin with? And why did you lie about what happened to these people? And if you want a new change in terms of foreign policy, don't pick her, because she's his secretary of state. I've got a real good chance of beating her, because I don't say things bad about her all the time -- just when she deserves it. And her definition of flat broke and mine are a little bit different.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I want to save it, just like Ronald Reagan did. [applause]
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I wasn't the best law student. By the end of this debate, it would be the most time I've ever spent in any library. [laughter] But on the first day in law school view (ph), it's called "Marbury v. Madison." The group in our constitutional democracy that interprets "The Constitution" as to what it means is the Supreme Court. In a 5-4 decision by the Supreme Court, they have ruled that same-sex marriage bans at the state level violate the Fourteenth Amendment to "The United States Constitution" equal protection clause. I don't agree with it, but that is the law of the land. But as president, what I want make sure of is that everybody in this room, Christian, Jewish, Muslim, whatever religion that you can practice your faith without government interference, you can marry people consistent with the tenets of your faith. That's the number one obligation of my presidency, is to protect religious people when they exercise their religious rights. But this decision is the law as it is of right now. And here's the one thing I want to tell you, Jake.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~If I believed they were trying to break out and get a bomb, absolutely. And here's the most important thing: they know I would if I had to. And none of us are going to be able to defend this country adequately until we rebuild our military. A weak economy, a military in decline, the world on fire, does that sound familiar to you? Michael, does that sound familiar to you? The first thing I'm going to do as commander in chief on day one is call the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and say, what do you need that you don't have? We're cutting our military; we're on track to have the smallest Army since 1940, the smallest Navy since 1915 and John Kasich says he wants to close more bases. I want to rebuild our military and I want the Iranians to know that, if I had to, I would use it. The worst nightmare in the world is a radical Islamic regime with a weapon of mass destruction. The only reason 3,000 of us died on 9/11 is not 3 million, not 3 million is because they couldn't get the weapons to kill us. They're on track to get a bomb even if they don't cheat. This deal is a nightmare for Israel. They are coming here if we don't watch it terrorism with a nuclear capability sponsored by Iran. So, yes, I would use military force to stop them. I would set this deal aside and I would get you a better deal. If you gave $100 billion, I could get almost anybody out of jail. We couldn't even get our hostages out of jail.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~If you want to see manufacturing, come to South Carolina
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Islamic websites need to be monitored.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~It's probably a small bit, but the ones that get it
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~It matters a lot.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Let's don't lose sight of the big picture here.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~One, thanks, CNN, for having people at this debate. [laughter]   I'm Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, in case you can't tell. I want to thank Ms. Reagan (ph) for inviting me. It means the world to me. I'm the only candidate tonight who served in the military while Ronald Reagan was our president and our commander in chief. It was one of the highlights of my life. I'm running for president to destroy radical Islam, to win the war on terror, to protect you and your family. And in that quest, I have an uncompromising determination to win this war, just like President Reagan had an uncompromising determination to destroy the evil empire, and win the Cold War. Above all others on both sides of the isle, I'm most qualified to be commander and chief on day one -- 33 years in the Air Force, 35 trips to Iraq and Afghanistan, I understand this war. I have a plan to win it, and I intend to win it. [applause]
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Probably for a good reason.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Right.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Strom Thurmond had four kids after he was 67, if you're not willing to do that, we've got to come up with a new legal immigration system. [applause]
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Thank you.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~That's not foreign policy. That's a cartoon character. John Kasich, a good friend of mine, said in New Hampshire, we're going to close more bases on his watch. On my watch, we're going to open up more bases. The military is in decline, folks. We're going to have the smallest military in modern times, spending half of what we'd normally spend by the end of this decade.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~That to me is bastardizing citizenship
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~That went nowhere.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~The bottom line, I'm trying to pitch the problem. We're not going to deport 11 million people here illegally, but we'll start with felons, and off they go. And, as to the rest, you can stay, but you got to learn our language. I don't speak it very well, well, look how far I've come? [laughter] Speaking English is a good thing. You got to pay taxes, you got to pay a fine, you got to get in the back of the line. You've got to secure your border or they'll keep coming. If you don't control who gets a job that never ends -- so (ph) got two borders. One with Canadia -- Canada, one with Mexico. I never met an illegal Canadian. This is an economic problem, so, folks, let's solve it. Amnesty is doing nothing, and that's what we've been doing. As to birthright citizenship, once we clean up this mess, in the future, prospectively, I'm going to look at the following. There are people buying tourist visas that go to resorts with maternity wards with the expressed purpose of having a children here in America. There are rich Asians, there are rich people up in the Mid-East
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Wait -- wait a minute. Whether you're the wedding cake baker or the gay couple or the Baptist preacher, radical Islam would kill you all if they could.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Wait a minute. Now, you asked me a question. So I don't want to take off the table the ability to slow down Obama in his last 13 to 14 months, because I want 60 votes to stop what I think he's going to do between now and January 2017. Five Republicans deflect -- leave -- we're in trouble. So folks, the world really is the way it is. President Obama is president. The goal is to get him out of there and pick somebody who would actually do something to repeal Obamacare, who would get you a better agreement. So Bobby, he would veto the bill, we don't have 67 votes, and you're giving away a defense against Obama for the rest of his presidency. No, I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to tell you things I can't do. I'm not going to tell you by shutting the government down, we're going to defund Obamacare as long as he's president. All that does is hurt us. I am trying to lead this party to winning.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~We'll show 'ya.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, all I can say, if you looked at polling in 2012 and 2008 at this level, we'd have -- at this stage, we would have President Perry and President Giuliani. I have a long way to go. And here's what I'm going to try to do tonight -- convince you that I'm best qualified to be the commander-in-chief of the one percent who are doing the fighting for the rest of us. And we'll have a serious discussion tonight. All of us are going to say we want to destroy ISIL. But here's what I'm going to tell you. What we're doing is not working. I have a plan to do it. If I'm president of the United States, we're going to send more ground forces into Iraq because we have to. President Obama made a huge mistake by leaving too soon against sound military advice. To every candidate tonight, are you willing to commit before the American people that you will destroy ISIL and you understand we need a ground force to do it? Are you willing -- Jake, please ask everybody the following question. Would you go from 3,500 to 10,000 American boots on the ground in Iraq to destroy ISIL? Because if you don't, we're going to lose. Are you willing to send American combat forces into Syria as part of a regional army, because if you don't, we'll never destroy ISIL in Syria. If you're not ready to these things you're not ready to be commander-in-chief.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, I know this. That when my mom and dad owned a restaurant, the bar, the pool room, that if you increased the minimum wage it'd been hard to hire more people. Hillary Clinton has a list a mile long to help the middle class. We're talking all around this. The middle class for the last six and a half years has been squeezed, and squeezed hard. To the middle class, I understand who you are. You're one broken down car from not going on vacation. You're from one sick child away from having to change your whole budget. Here's what I want to do as your president. I want to grow this economy. When Boeing came to South Carolina to build a 787, everybody paid more they would have lost their employees to Boeing. If you're a waitress out there wanting more money, I'm not going to increase the minimum wage, I'm going to try to create an environment where somebody else will open up a restaurant across the street to hire you away at a higher rate, or they'll have to pay you more to keep you. You got to borrow money to create jobs in this country. Banking is locked down because of Dodd-Frank. The tax code is a complete mess, but nobody's talked about the elephant in the room, which is debt. Not one more penny to the federal government until w2e come up with a plan to get out of debt.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, let's talk about immigration. Number one, I like Rick. I don't remember the Santorum plan when I was in the Senate. The peanut gallery on this is interesting. I have been trying to solve this problem for a decade. There are no democrats here tonight. If you're here, raise your hand. You went to the wrong -- we'll, welcome. Thank you very much for coming. [laughter] [crosstalk]
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, number one, I will win a war that we can't afford to lose. I have a plan to destroy radical Islam because it has to be. These are religious Nazis running while President Obama has made one mistake after another and it's caught up with us. What do I have to offer that's different? I get my foreign policy from being in on the ground. I've been to Iraq and Afghanistan in the Middle East 35 times in the last decade, trying to understand how we got in this mess. Our leading candidate gets his foreign policy from watching television. And what I heard last night is the Cartoon Network, oh, I'm big, I'm strong, we're going to hit them in the head. [laughter]
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, Ronald Reagan did a couple of really big things that we should all remember. He sat down with Tip O'Neill, the most liberal guy in the entire House. They started drinking together. That's the first thing I'm going to do as president. We're going to drink more. [applause] And what did this -- two great Irishmen do? They found a way to save Social Security from bankruptcy by adjusting the age of retirement from 65 to 67. So, yes, I will say nice things at times about Democrats. Yes, I will work them -- work with them. [laughter] I will put the country ahead of party. Absolutely I want to work with them. At the end of the day, Hugh, I'm lucky to be standing here. I'm the first in my family to ever go to college. Neither one of my parents finished high school. Darline's here with me tonight. We owned a restaurant
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, wait a minute. We
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, what about the other half
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, what I hope Republican voters, libertarian, vegetarians, Democrats, you name it, will look for somebody to lead us in a new direction, domestically, but particularly on the foreign policy front. President Obama is making a mess of the world. What I'm trying to tell you here tonight, that Syria is hell on Earth and it's not going to get fixed by insulting each other. I've been there 35 times to Iraq and Afghanistan. I am ready to be commander-in-chief on day one. I've been in the military 33 years, 140 days on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan. I am so ready to get on with winning a war that we can't afford to lose. I hope you believe that experience matters. It's an all- volunteer force of -- when you vote for commander-in-chief, they are stuck with your choice. We've had one novice being commander-in- chief. Let's don't replace one novice with another. And if I thought
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, you know, Kim Davis, I'm not worried about her attacking me. I am worried about radical Islamic terrorists who are already here planning another 9/11. We're at war, folks. I'm not fighting a crime. I want to have a legal system that understands the difference between fighting a war and fighting a crime, and here's the reality. Young men from the Mid- East are different than Kim Davis. And we've got to understand that.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~What are you going to do with the 11 million?
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~What do I offer? What do I offer? To make your families safe and our country strong again, a vision and a determination to win a war that we cannot afford to lose.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~What do you do with the 11 million?
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Who won with hispanics.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~with fixing the problem in Syria.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Yeah, but I
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Yeah, I'd like to stop that in the future
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Yes, number one, how does President Obama sleep at night? Look what you let happen on your watch. Your commanders told you, don't withdrawal from Iraq because we'll lose of our gains. Three years ago your entire national security team, Senator McCain and I begged you to do a no-fly zone and help the Free Syrian Army while it would matter. But you said no. I'm not blaming Bobby, I'm not blaming Rick, I'm not blaming anybody, I'm blaming Barack Obama for this mess.
Lindsey Graham~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~You asked me a question. This is important. Republicans need to tell the American people we get it as to who you are. When my mom died, I was 21. When my dad died, when I was 22. We were wiped out financially. If it weren't for Social Security survivor benefit check coming into Darline, we wouldn't have made it. I don't need a lecture from Democrats about Social Security.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~-- my response is, no, I'm going to stop a war because a nuclear Iran is the end.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~16 years ago, this country was tremendously inspired by a young woman who faced a gunman in Columbine and was challenged about her faith and she refused to deny God. We saw her as a hero. Today, someone who refuses to defy (sic) a judge's unconstitutional verdict is ridiculed and criticized, chastised because she's standing up and denying -- not denying her God and her faith. That is a huge difference in 16 years. People have a fundamental right in the First Amendment. There's no more important right. It is the right that is the trunk that all other rights come from, and that's the freedom of conscience. And when we say in America that we have no room -- how many bakers, how many florists, how many pastors, how many clerks are we going to throw in jail because they stand up and say, "I cannot violate what my faith says is against its teachings"? Is there not room in America? I believe there has to be room. First, I believe we have to pass the First Amendment Defense Act, which provides that room for government officials and others who do not want to be complicit in what they believe is against their faith. Second, we need as a president who's going to fight a court that is abusive, that has superseded their authority. Judicial supremacy is not in the Constitution, and we need a president and a Congress to stand up to a court when it exceeds its constitutional authority. [applause]
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~about them and their chance to rise
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Actually, I'm going to be proposing a plan, I call it the 20/20 perfect vision for America as flat tax, a 20 percent flat tax on income, 20 percent flat tax on capital gains and on corporations. We eliminate all the deductions, special interest provisions and corporations. We deal with the carried interest issue, because everybody pays the same 20 percent. So, there's no advantage as to how you take your income. That will create growth. We're going to allow expensing for corporations. For manufacturing, again, I print -- I pledged, when I announced that I was going to run for president on the factory floor that I would make America the number one manufacturer in the world. Why? Because we need to put Americans back to work. Hard working Americans, who are not doing well in this economy, and we start creating jobs here, and manufacturing. These people from all skill levels are going to be able to work. We put a 20 percent rate on corporations, we're competitive with almost every country in the world. We allow for expensing, we have a three year phase in. We start at zero for manufacturers, phase it up to 20. You're going to see an enormous investment of capital, and equipment. You're going to see people -- you're going to have problems finding folks are going to be able to work in manufacturing. That's how many jobs we're going to create. So, the answer is, you know, we're going to lower, and flatten taxes. We're going to put government on a -- on a budget. A 10 percent across the board cut
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~and that's why they're upset.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~And that's why you can trust me to do it again. [applause]
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~As you know, 40 to 60 percent of the 11 million are here on visa overstays. We know exactly who they are, we should know where they are, but we have a government that doesn't tell them to return home. You can solve half of the problem of the 11 million
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~As you know, Hugh, 12 years ago I authored the Iran Freedom Support Act, which put sanctions on the Iran nuclear program as we came within four votes of passing a very strong version of that. The four people who opposed on the floor: Joe Biden, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. And we came four votes short. But for 12 years, I have been laser-beam focused on the issue of Iran with a nuclear weapon. Why? Because I understand who they are. Yes, they are radical Islamists, that's true. But their particular version of it, which is an apocalyptic version, which is a death cult, they believe in bringing about the end of the -- end of the world. If you -- if you poll Iranians and Iraqis, Shiites in the region, more than two-thirds of them believe that the end of the world is going to come within their lifetime. Why? Because their regime preaches it. They believe in bringing about the end of times. That's their theological goal and we are in the process of giving them a nuclear weapon to do just that. That's why, on day one, I would say to the Iranian government, you open up all of these facilities for inspection, you make them available to the U.N. and to the U.S., everything, we can go everywhere or else we will take out those facilities. And when people say, you're going to start a war --
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~As you know, Lindsay
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~But, the point is -- the point is is that I had a bill
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~by simply telling the 11 million that they have to return to their country of origin, so, that's half your problem
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~employment. We've got a lot of plans.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~He mentioned my name, and that i didn't have a plan. And, the fact of the matter is
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~He talked about manufacturing, and the fact is that we have a zero percent rate that faces the 20, we'd have a seven percent repatriation, so money -- about two trillion dollars over seas
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Hi, I'm Rick Santorum. Some of you may know me because I led the fight to end partial birth abortion. Some of you may know me because the I led the fight to end welfare as we know it, put people back to work, reduce poverty and reduce the federal budget. Some of you may know me because I successfully put sanctions on the Iranian nuclear program in Congress, over opposition of both parties initially. But hopefully, most of you know me most because I'm the proud father of seven children with particularly a special little disabled girl, who is the heart and core of my heart and married to a wonderful woman named Karen for 25 years, who is the love of my life. [applause]
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Hold on, hold on, hold on
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I've said -- I've said 10,000 and, if more is necessary, look, the answer is this, once ISIS established a caliphate, the game changed because once you establish a caliphate, you have an area of control, you have to take ground from that caliphate, because if you don't, then, in the Islamic world, it's seen as a legitimate caliphate. As long as they have territorial integrity, and even expand it, they have legitimacy and much of the Muslim world to call people to join their jihad here in America as well as in Iraq and in Syria. So we must take their ground.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I came to Washington in the most unlikely way. I defeated a 14-year incumbent, a 60 percent Democratic district. I went to Washington thinking I was only going to be there for one term, and so I just shook things up. We sent the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee to jail. We ended 40 years, 40 years of Democratic control of the Congress. And I led that fight with reforms, substantive reforms, welfare reform. I led the charge -- I wrote the bill when I was in the House. I led the charge in the United States Senate. Partial-birth abortion -- in fact, three pro-life bills, bipartisan pro-life bills. I mentioned the Iran bill. We also passed one on Syria. Health savings accounts, as many of you know, I authored the original bill on health savings accounts, pushed that through the Congress for private sector health care reform. An outsider who came to Washington from the tough state of Pennsylvania, and we got conservative things done. I made things happen in a town where things don't happen very much. Now, after 10 years of seeing the mess, the retreat that we see in the Republican party in Washington, D.C., it's time to get someone who is an outsider.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I don't know how many democrats I had on my bill
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I have proposed 10,000 troops, I did so about six or seven months ago, that we needed to deploy additional troops to do exactly what Lindsey said, arm the Kurds, arm -- [crosstalk]
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I hope so. If they're wrong.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I just want to say -- I just want to say, I have seven kids, I've done my part.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I think personal attacks, just please one person, Hillary Clinton. And all we do when we go after each other -- and we've seen a bunch of it, from people up on this stage, people who are going to be on the stage afterwards, who go after and make personal attacks on people. There are plenty of policy differences between the candidates up here and the candidates later. Donald Trump has ever right to run for president as a Republican, as anybody else in this audience, and he may have positions I disagree with, but he has the right to do that and the people should be given the benefit of the doubt for people to see through these things. I don't think it helps when Republicans attack Republicans personally. I'll say some things tonight which will be very big differences. The issue of immigration is one that there are huge differences in this field, and I will be out there talking about how we have to control immigration. How we have to look after the American worker. The focus of this debate should be on how we're going to win this election and help improve the quality of life for American workers, and we aren't doing that, when we're out there picking at each other and calling each other names. The name we should call out is, what are we going to do for average Americans losing ground in America today. And that should be our focus.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~It's less than one percent.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Let me just
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Lindsay, is we need to win -- we need to win fighting for Americans. We need to win fighting for the workers in this country
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Lindsay, what percentage of American workers make the minimum wage right now?
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Martin Luther King wrote a letter from the Birmingham jail. And he said in that letter that there are just laws and there are unjust laws. And we have no obligation to -- to condone and accept unjust laws. And he -- and they -- then he followed up and said what's an unjust law? An unjust law is a job that -- a law that go against the moral code or God's law or the natural law. I would argue that what the Supreme Court did is against the natural law, it's against God's law and we have every obligation to stand in opposition to it.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~No, what you have is judicial supremacy. You don't have a rule of law when the court has the final say on everything.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Not from a party that supports special interest tax provisions for a whole bunch of other businesses, and, but, when it comes to hardworking Americans who are at the bottom of the income scale, we can't provide some level of income support? What I've proposed is not anything but the (ph) presidents (ph) proposed (ph) I believe that would be harmful to the American public, but a $.50 cents an hour increase over three years, which is what I'm proposing. So we would have a minimum wage which would be roughly in the area of what it's been historically, about 5 percent of wages. To me, if you're going to talk to 90 percent of American workers -- by the way, 90 percent of American workers don't own a bar. They don't own a business. They work for a living. They're wage -- most of them are wage earners. And Republicans are losing elections because we're not talking about them. All we want to talk about is, what happened to our business? There are people who work in that business. I was at a -- I was at the convention four years ago, and on the signs -- on all of the seats the night I spoke was a sign that said, "We built that," because Barack Obama had talked about how businesses didn't build their own businesses. Then we trotted out one small-business person after another for almost an hour that night talking about how they built their businesses. And that's wonderful. But you know what we didn't do? We didn't bring one worker on that stage. How are you going to win, ladies and gentlemen? How are we going to win if 90 percent of Americans don't think we care at all
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Now, it's not 11 million
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Shook things up, got things done.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~So, what you're saying, what every Republican's up here saying is we're against the minimum wage because, if you're not for increasing it, than whoevers making the minimum wage right now
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~That's right
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~that I did have a plan back in 2006. I introduced a plan called, A Comprehensive Border Security Bill, which did, in fact, put the resources to build the fencing, and deploy the troops, and the technology necessary which
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~The answer is Republicans don't believe in a floor wage in America. Fine, you go ahead and make that case to the American public, I'm not going to. Not from a party that supported bailouts. I didn't, but this party did.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~The folks -- the folks who are -- hurt the worst are recent immigrants. By illegal immigrants coming to this country last year alone, 700,000 illegal immigrants came into this country. Who do you think are most impacted? It's the folks who came into this country, played by the rules, did what they were supposed to do. Came here, and went to work, and now they're finding themselves out of work because someone illegally is willing to come in and work for less
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~the people who are hurt the most by illegal immigration are hispanics.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, contrary to what Governor Jindal said, Governor -- Justice Roberts had a long record and it was a long, good record. And so he made a bad decision on -- a couple of bad decisions on ObamaCare but he's made a lot of great decisions, too. And so I don't -- I don't regret at all standing up for John Roberts but, you know, it's easy to sit out in Louisiana and talk about how, you know, well, I'd be tougher. I fought when I was in the United States Senate. We fought, for the first time, to defeat justices and judges that Bill Clinton nominated and I fought with President Bush to defend his nominees, to push even a filibuster, breaking the filibuster. I led that fight against someone who didn't want to end the filibuster in order for us to get good, conservative justices. So I have been there on the front line, fighting for judges and conservative justices and I will do so as president like none other.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, in fact, just about everybody in this field supports some pathway to citizenship. There are just a few, Governor Jindal, Senator Cruz, Senator Rubio, Jeb Bush, a lot of others, Senator Graham, all support some sort of amnesty at some point in time or another. And this is really the interesting thing about this whole debate. This debate should not be about what we're going to do with someone who's here illegally. This debate should not be about what we're going to do with someone who's here illegally; This debate should be about what -- what every other debate on every other policy issue is in America. What's in the best interest of hardworking Americans? What's in the best interest of our country. We've had to focus because the other side has set up for us, here is who we have to be concerned about on the issue of immigration, someone who's here illegally and their family, and what are we going to do about it? A greater leader will see that the objection of every law in America is to do what's in the best interest of America. And what's in the best interest of America right now is to look at wages, look at employment among wager earners. 70 to 90 percent of people who've come into this country, 35 million over the last 20 years, are wage earners that are holding wages down, taking jobs away from America.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, just because you don't call it amnesty doesn't mean that what -- what almost everybody in this field is for is allowing people who are in this country illegally, people who broke the law to come into this country, people who came here legally and overstayed, to stay in -- in America. Again, we have 35 million -- we have the highest percentage of -- of -- of immigrants in this country, as far as numbers ever, as far as percentage, the -- the highest in 105 years. Wages are flatlining. The reason that you're seeing the angst and the anger out there and the reason this issue has taken off is because workers in America know that their wages are being undermined. If you look at, from the year 2000 to the year 2014, there're 5.7 million net new jobs created. What percentage of those jobs are held by people who weren't born here? The answer is all of them. The fact is, American workers are -- are getting hurt by immigration
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, you're right, Lindsay, it went no where because we had a president back then who was for more comprehensive immigration reform
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~who are hurting, including including hispanics
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Who can go to Washington, D.C., and get things done. You know what, you have a lot of folks who will tell you a lot of things. Look at their record. I went to Washington as an outsider.
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Would come back, and be invested in equipment here. We will create more jobs with this plan, than any plan out
Rick Santorum~Republican Candidates "Undercard" Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~You know what we need to do
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~About Medicare?
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps. And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers. And, this is what I am finding throughout America.People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country. And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product. You're talking about $2.7 trillion. We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly. So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those &mdash;[audience boos]See? They know. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it. I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Since I was attacked too.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~That's not true.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~The rate &mdash; the rate &mdash; the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, first of all the &mdash; the plan gives people the option of &mdash; of opting out. But I think they will see a very good option here. You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion. And there are 48 million people involved &mdash; 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.Divide that out. That comes out to $12,500 for each one. Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about. How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives. This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent. I used the tithing analogy.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy. I have studied that issue in great detail. And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.And &mdash; you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers &mdash; this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of &mdash; great deal of problems for our society right now.And &mdash; and &mdash; you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything. The reason that I &mdash; I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.That cost gets passed on to the people. Now, who are the people who are hurt by that? It's poor people and middle class. Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich. Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality. I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect. I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman. And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe. And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up. You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies. And we need to make that very clear to everybody. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, that's easy to answer. I didn't have an involvement with them. That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society. Total propaganda.I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people. They were paid speeches. It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.Do I take the product? Yes. I think it's a good product.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people. What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American? And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee. Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~When &mdash; when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes. You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies. Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.So, also, we can stimulate the economy. That's gonna be the real growth engine. Stimulating the economy &mdash; because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~&mdash; living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record. I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies &mdash;
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~&mdash; the issue is who is going to get it done.[crosstalk]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~&mdash; work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~and be held accountable.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.92 percent &mdash; 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women. Senator Cruz is precisely right. Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration. The number of women &mdash;
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt. I agree with them. And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected. Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years. We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.Ours was intended to be a citizen government. This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k). The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up &mdash; retirement plans. There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I understand.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I would just say that  [laughter]   I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said. Every election we talk about this. Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform. It never happens.I would like to start with a basic. Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent. It's kind of basic. There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.My point is this. While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics. And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable. So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~It is why we have to simplify. It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~John, I &mdash; if I &mdash; a lot of people have jumped in here. I'd like to jump in. A lot of people have jumped in here.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.? We have been talking about it for decades. We now have a 73,000-page tax code.There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone. There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.The problem is we never get it done. We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades. It never happens. And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse. And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits. But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed. We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country. How great is that? They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year. And why? They cite Obamacare.They are refusing to
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~No. You know why three? Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody. Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform &mdash;
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~That's right, three pages.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes. The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough. [laughter]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky. [laughter]Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail. I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable. Imagine &mdash; imagine &mdash; if a politician were held to that standard of account.I will run on my record all day long. [applause]And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~You know why three?
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~You know, every election we hear a lot of talk. We hear a lot of good plans. We hear actually a lot of good intentions. But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed. What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results. That's how you go from secretary to CEO. You lead and you produce results. I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare. And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina. I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton. And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about. Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.What's crony capitalism? Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating? Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street? Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless &mdash; in this case, 1,590 community banks &mdash; go out of business.You see, folks, this is how socialism starts. Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem. This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.The student loan problem has been created by government. Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem. The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.But guess who pushed for that regulation? The big Internet companies. This is what's going on. Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid. It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together. It's you see the health insurance companies getting together. It's why you see the banks consolidating.And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed. Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed. Community banks are going out of business. Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent &mdash; 80 percent &mdash; and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover. I was recruited to H.P. to save a company.It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders. It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.As an outsider, I tackled H.P.'s entrenched problems head-on. I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.And yes, it was a very difficult time. However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business &mdash; like Gateway &mdash; taking all their jobs with them.The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times. I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now. And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom. There are politics in the boardroom as well.And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what? We were wrong. She was right. She was a great CEO. She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P. is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~And &mdash; and &mdash; and I &mdash; you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton &mdash; and I've already heard from her &mdash; is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.What we know is we're living longer. That's a blessing. It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later? Or would you rather take less later on?
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football? [laughter]We have &mdash; wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt. We have people out of work. We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us. And we're talking about fantasy football? Can we stop? [applause]How about this? How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families. Enough on fantasy football. Let people play, who cares?[crosstalk]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I'm going to go to Washington to stop it
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly. Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage. You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist. And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which. [laughter]But I will &mdash; but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it. The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.But I know who the pessimist is. It's Hillary Clinton. And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House. Take it to the bank.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I want to talk to the folks at home. I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you? Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money? Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?I've got one more question for you then. Are you serious about this election? Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture. I am deadly serious about changing this culture. I changed it in New Jersey. I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.I'm prepared. I'm tested. I'm ready. And I want to make this our government. For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~John, I'll tell you something. You want to talk about moral authority. Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news. You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law. And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers? Does he stand up for law enforcement? No, he doesn't. I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people. This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States. That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~No, John. John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer? [laughter]How are we going to do this? [applause]Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude. So  [laughter]We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy. I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.Why? Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely. But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth. For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.It isn't there anymore, Mike. They stole it. It got stolen from them. It's not theirs anymore. The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it. I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home. The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you. They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund. All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years. We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service. And, that's with zero percent interest rates.Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements. And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years. And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton. What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there. If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more? Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend. We need to get realistic about this. We're not &mdash; the American people &mdash; forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from. And
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy. I've laid out
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~You bet they do. And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be. The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are. They like General Motors, so they give them a pass. They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace. It's a political Justice Department.And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies. We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders. We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.And to expand on Mr. Carson's &mdash; or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already. We don't need newer (ph) laws. We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for &mdash; again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on. Let's let a Justice Department &mdash; and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word. It will be a way of life.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~And, I'll do that with the country. We will make America great again. And, thank you everybody. Just for the record.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership. [applause]But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target. They look around for gun-free zones. You know, we could give you another example &mdash; the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed. Two of them were among the most highly decorated &mdash; they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns. And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them. If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long. I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe. They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK? He hit oil. He got lucky with fracking. Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well. Number &mdash; and that is important for you to know.Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.And Lehman Brothers started it all. He was on the board. And he was a managing general partner.And just thirdly, he was so nice. He was such a nice guy. And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack. But then his poll numbers tanked. He has got &mdash; that is why he is on the end. [laughter] And he got nasty. And he got nasty. So you know what? You can have him.[crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~he's really doing some bad [crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally. And you know what? They can have it anyway you want. You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want. I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect &mdash; and actually some of these folks I really like a lot &mdash; but I'm the only one that can say that. I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given &mdash; if I'm given the opportunity to be president.As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have &mdash; it's fine. They have to come into this country legally. We have a country of borders. We have a country of laws. We have to obey the laws. It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I never said that. I never said that.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much. I'm too trusting. And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive. I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me. So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up." [laughter]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I think you're &mdash; [applause][crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I was not at all critical of him. I was not at all. In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people. They go to Harvard. They go to Yale. They go to Princeton. They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I would change them. I would change them.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan. We're reducing taxes to 15 percent. We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions. We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall. We're going to create a border. We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally. They're going to come in legally. And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that. They built the great wall of China. That's 13,000 miles. Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers. So we need 1,000.We can do a wall. We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall. We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally. And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico &mdash; I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders &mdash; but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay? A politician other than the people in the states &mdash; I don't want to &mdash; a politician cannot get them to pay. I can. We lose, we have a trade imbalance Excuse me, John . of $50 billion
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Or somebody else. Right.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Our country doesn't win anymore. We used to win, we don't win anymore. We lose on trade. We lose with ISIS. We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran. We don't win.Let me give you one quick example. These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours. I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad. I went out and said, it's ridiculous. Nobody &mdash; I could stand up here all night. Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours. It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.We called Ben, he was with me 100%. We called in, we said, that's it. We're not doing it. They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done. Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here. Not bad. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Probably, I don't know &mdash; you people write the stuff. I don't know where you  [laughter] [applause]And if I could say just one thing. I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding. I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money. And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous &mdash; so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results. Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?But I will be putting &mdash; I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money. SuperPacs are a disaster. They're a scam. They cause dishonesty. And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people. And I'm not blaming these folks &mdash; well, I guess I could. [laughter]Very good people are making very bad decisions right now. And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Right.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Right. Dynamically.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~So I have nothing at all critical of him.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Such a nasty &mdash; such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Thank you.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~That's not right. That is absolutely not right. You know that. That is not right.[UNIDENTIFIED:] Thank you.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~That's right.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.[crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman. Atlantic City has gone bad. I mean, Chris will know about that. I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that. Caesar's &mdash; excuse me &mdash; Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy. Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy &mdash; the biggest.But also the biggest people (ph) &mdash; now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself. I never filed for bankruptcy. But many, many people did. What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.Now hundreds of companies I've opened. I've used it three times, maybe four times. Came out great. But I guess I'm supposed to come out great. That is what I could do for the country. We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems. Nobody can solve it like me.But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived. I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds. And I'm glad I did it.I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Yes, I might feel more comfortable. I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York &mdash; a permit to carry. And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot. But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly  [laughter]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Yes, it's very simple. We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic. We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back. We're going to cut costs. We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.[UNKNOWN:]: Governor, you just heard him.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Yes.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~&mdash; the governor's absolutely right. But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security. We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~[inaudible], the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future. They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back. There are lids on people's aspirations. Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time. Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same. We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~America's at a crossroads. The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse. I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee. I will do so in a way that will bring people together. We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again. Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again. I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Becky &mdash;
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~But the idea that you can't &mdash; that you're just gonna grow your way out of this &mdash; I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.[UNKNOWN:]: Governor Kasich, do you want 30 seconds?
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Could I &mdash; could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work. He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field. He's a gifted politician.But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work. I mean, literally, the Senate &mdash; what is it, like a French work week? You get, like, three days where you have to show up? You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job. There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Gronkowski is still going strong. I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week. So I'm doing great. But we're not gambling.And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation. Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all. And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit. And there should be some regulation. I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.[crosstalk]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~He wasn't my senator.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Look, the &mdash; the deal is already done. The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up. You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes &mdash; cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss. [laughter]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Look, the &mdash; the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family. And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and &mdash; and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do. You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost &mdash; that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this. And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.The government has tried it their way. Under &mdash; under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.We need to take a new approach of taxing &mdash; reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our &mdash; in our country before it's too late.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~No, no. What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said. Let the states do this. You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government. It is broke, it is not working.[crosstalk]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, I've been &mdash;
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, the deal was done. Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts. You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation. And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president. And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.We need to reverse that. And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year. You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record. $19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created. We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~You find me
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~You find me a Democrat &mdash; you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars? Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars. I'll talk to them.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.And make sure you enhance savings in the private market. The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up. It took &mdash; it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k). Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~You know, I am by my nature impatient. And this is not an endeavor that rewards that. You gotta be patient. You gotta be &mdash; stick with it, and all that.But also, I can't fake anger. I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth. And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country. It's never been that way in American politics before.I can't do it. I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply &mdash; you know, going down. I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~&mdash; fix America, this is the formula. It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio. Thank you.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~an agreement with the [crosstalk]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass. And we will be strong again. Thank you.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~country moving again.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out &mdash; out in the &mdash; in the cold. I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 &mdash; people here from this country out of this country, splitting families. I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in &mdash; in a deeper hole than they are today.We need somebody who can lead. We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.You can't do it with empty promised. You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.I actually have a plan. I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic. You just don't make promises like this.Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up &mdash; coming up with these fantasy tax schemes. We'll just clean it up. Where are you gonna clean it up?You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending. You gotta be creative and imaginative.Now, let me just be clear, John. I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus. We're up 347,000 jobs.When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced. I was the architect. It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon. We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.That's was hard work. Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing. Creativity.This stuff is fantasy. Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid. Come on, that's just not &mdash; you scare senior citizens with that. It's not responsible.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.And so much of what we did &mdash; to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups &mdash; can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare. We can make a stronger program. But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy. You can't grow your way out of demographics.But we can give people better health care. And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating &mdash; keep giving
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"I said, absolutely, you can still change the world. And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world. Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem. We need to rebuild our families. We need to have stronger families. We need to know who our neighbors are. We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down. Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods. We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will. And God bless America. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~John.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Let me just &mdash; let me respond. First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified. We're one of the fastest growing states in the country. We came back from the dead. And you know what? It works very, very well.And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers. I was a banker and I was proud of it. And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work. My state is doing great across the board. And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Listen, I want to just comment.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average. We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment. Folks, you want to &mdash;
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~that he tried to take credit for four years later. It's a joke.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well I want to comment on this. This is the fantasy
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, first of all, in Ohio we're changing the whole system. Universities will not get paid one dime unless the student graduates or &mdash; graduates or completes a course.Secondly, you can be in high school and complete almost an entire first year before you go to college and get credit to do that. And, of course, in addition to that, we are working now to go after the cost drivers in our universities. And let me give you an example. Universities today have so many non-academic assets. At Ohio State they sold the parking garage and the parking lot, and they got $500 million because they shouldn't be in the parking lot business. They shouldn't be in the ding business, they shouldn't be in the dorm business.And, of course, we need to take advantage of on-line education to reduce these costs and begin to dis-intermediate the cost of four years.Now, for those who that have these big high costs, I think we can seriously look at an idea of where you can do public service. I mean legitimate, public service and begin to pay off some of that debt through the public service that you do. And in the meantime, it may inspire us to care more about our country, more about ourselves.This is a big moral issue in America. Living a life bigger than yourself, and being a center of healing and justice. And people can learn it through public service.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now. And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster. Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on. We could do a whole show on that.I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality. My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety. I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise. Again [crosstalk]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare. If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well. Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive. Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state &mdash; $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.This is the same old stuff since I left.You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget. We actually did it. And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes. You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy. So what I will tell you about our incentives &mdash; our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.And you know what? Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country &mdash; I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, I mean right here. To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government? And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse? Or that we're just going to be great? Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans &mdash; or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?Folks, we've got to wake up. We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job. You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio. And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~And I used it to pay off my loans. And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Here's the bottom line. [applause]I'm not &mdash; my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage. I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush. I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage. I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I get to respond, right?
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing. And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue. The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, [inaudible] 10 good candidates. The Democrats can't even come up with one.And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight. Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations. Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries. My mother is on Medicare and Social Security. I'm against anything that's bad for my mother. [laughter]So, we're talking about &mdash; we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable. And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I was mentioned in the question.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~in the world for people
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes. I don't recall the Sun &mdash; in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him. In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again. So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Let me &mdash; let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today. Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes. I don't recall them calling for his resignation &mdash;
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement. It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~No Jeb, I don't remember &mdash; well, let me tell you. I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record. The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~No, that's &mdash; you're wrong. In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan. And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.Number one, you have people in this country that
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~No. No. What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas. They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.You didn't see it for a minute. You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it. And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.[crosstalk]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~numerically, it's gonna be higher. But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.We are lowering taxes on small business. You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning. He's an S corporation. He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income. That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.[crosstalk]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~OK. I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac. It's called the mainstream media who every single day  [applause]   and I'll tell you why. Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee. She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements." She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video. And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.It was the week she got exposed as a liar. It was the week that she got exposed as a liar  [applause]But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?[crosstalk]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Thank you for that question. I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us. And that doesn't have to be true.Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now. If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Thank you.Well, I've learned the rules on this. [laughter]Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents. Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here. And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.But in 2015, we have a very different economy. Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based. It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~That's an interesting question. That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too. Why don't you wait in line? Wait for what? This country is running out of time. We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck. They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.You have small businesses in America that are struggling. For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting. We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies. And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.We have a &mdash; they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington? We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.The time to act is now. The time to turn the page is now. If we &mdash; if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all. You know why? Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.I want to be in &mdash; I want America to be the best
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again. If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms. For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days. You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.But here's the best solution of all. We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century. Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work. But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs. But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those &mdash; those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, it's interesting. Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport. You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, you're talking about &mdash; yeah.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, you just &mdash; you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all. But I'm going to tell you the truth.Here's the truth. I didn't inherit any money. My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid. They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.They didn't save enough money for us to go to school. I had to work my way through school. I had to borrow money to go to school. I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month. [laughter]I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard. We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family &mdash; a better life for our family.We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in. My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more. And that's what this economy needs to &mdash; that's what this debate needs to be about.This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book. I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families. And I make a lot more than the average American. Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.We can't afford another four years of that. Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.Thank you, senator.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Yeah, but that &mdash; because the math is, if you &mdash; 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand. So yeah, someone who makes more money
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~You did. No, you did. [applause][crosstalk]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~You know, America doesn't owe me anything. I have a debt to America I'll never repay. This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family. My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did. We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special. But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away. And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president. Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~"diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"

Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that. Thank you.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I don't know.[UNKNOWN:]: Where's it made? Is it made in China?[UNKNOWN:]: Is it made in China or Mexico?
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something. In fact, that's part of the problem. If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.I mean, what we had was something the government made &mdash; basically a bag of gas &mdash; that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.That is our government today. We saw it in the blimp. [applause]That's exactly what we saw. So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility. When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.And it's not the folks on Wall Street. I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I have no idea.[crosstalk]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~is paid &mdash; played fairly.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income. And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means. If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it. If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in. I just want to remind you, people paid their money. They expect to have it. And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country. [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Let me just close it out this way.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~No, sir
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Now, everybody else has fudged their time and gone over, so please, don't cut me off too quick, Becky.

Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~We need to be focusing on what fixes this country. And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about &mdash; we haven't talked about it tonight.Why aren't we talking about &mdash; instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people &mdash; why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~we need to honor our promises [crosstalk]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease. The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this. And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease. We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio &mdash; when I was a little kid, we eradicated it. You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America? We didn't spend any. We've saved billions of dollars.You want to fix Medicare? Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars. Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, I would really appreciate that. First of all, yes, we've stolen. Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.But, you know what we're not telling them? It's their money. This isn't the governments money. This is not entitlement, it's not welfare. This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks. Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it. Now, we're going to blame the people.Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money. That makes no sense to everybody. And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."No their not. It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this. But, let me tell you who not to blame. Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security. Let's quit making it a problem for them. It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more. You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of. [laughter]But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules. I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid. Play by the rules.And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~You're welcome. [laughter]Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary. I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine. [applause]You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year? I'm the only guy on this stage &mdash; you know, everybody has an "only guy" &mdash; "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that." Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years. And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.Somebody says "I'm a fighter." Well, I want to know, did you win? Well, I did. And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that. And I think that ought to be worth something.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players. And, we come out here, and we do our thing. And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.I've got five grandkids. I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt. Good luck making something out of this mess."And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves. We honest to god are here to get this country back on track. I know this, I certainly am.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time. I love Donald Trump. He is a good man. I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight. Get over that one, OK? [applause][crosstalk][UNKNOWN:]: Is it made in Mexico?
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Alright. Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class. In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals. Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well. It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut. Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~John
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~John, I'd like to address this? John, could I follow up on this?
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Liberty thrives when government is small. I want a government so small I can barely see it. I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper. I think, though, government is too big now. And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.This is extraordinary. It's extraordinarily wrong. You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items. That's what they're doing. They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.Here's the thing. When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government. In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government. Instead, the Washington establishment raised both. We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this. This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left. Right and left are spending us into oblivion. We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Say again?
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government? And what distributes goods better? It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.Is there an area for a safety net? Can you have Medicare or Social Security? Yes. But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000. But the average person takes out about $350,000. We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.When people ask me, whose fault is it? Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money? And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids. [laughter]After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers. Now we're having smaller families. We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.It's not working. I have a bill to fix Medicare. I've a bill to fix Social Security. For both of them you have to gradually raise the age. If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, thank you very much. I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed. And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill. I would prevent them lobbying Congress. I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem. You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse. I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.What you need to do is free up interest rates. Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, that's a real question. Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership? I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same. People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this. Well, you know what I'm worried about? Not keeping the government open. I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.We're borrowing a million dollars a minute. That is important. And that's what we have to contrast. Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.[crosstalk]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~What are the rules on who gets to follow up. How do we decide on who gets to follow up? I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~You can't do nothing. And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed." That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question. It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security. You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back." There is no money, it's a stack of paper. There is no money in the Social Security account. There is no money in the Medicare account. There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.[crosstalk][UNKNOWN:]:  to deal with this. We did it 200 days ago.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt. We borrow a million dollars a minute. Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit. It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.I will stand firm. I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it. I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it. And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~10% flat rate
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~And Carl &mdash; Carl, I'm not finished yet.The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?" [laughter]And let me be clear.[crosstalk]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org. It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up. The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent. Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars. Those are the hard numbers. And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~eliminates the business [UNKNOWN]: [inaudible]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Growth is the answer. And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~I'm too agreeable, easy going. [laughter]You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite. I'm a fighter. I am passionate about what I believe. I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution. And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party. If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy. But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~income tax [UNKNOWN]: What are you doing?
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS. [cheering and pplause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Let me be clear. The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate. That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. [laughter]And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary. The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other. It should be what are your substantive positions [crosstalk]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Let me say on that
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Let me tell you how that question [crosstalk]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Rand is exactly right. His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Then I'll buy you a tequila
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, Rick, it's a very important question. I have got deep concerns about the Fed. The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed. And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women. You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great. It's driving up stock prices. Wall Street is doing great.You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928. But if you look at working men and women. If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.She sees her cost of electricity going up. She sees her health insurance going up. And loose money is one of the major problems. We need sound money. And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, sure. This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken. Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right. Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers &mdash; look. I'm 44 years old.It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us. We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.You know, you look at women working. I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family. My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms. My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together. But I &mdash; the struggle of single moms is extraordinary. And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733. The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations. And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics. That is who I'm fighting for. The people that Washington leaves behind.[crosstalk]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~You're not interested in an answer.[crosstalk]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~You don't want to hear the answer. You just want to [crosstalk]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington. The natural next question is who actually has done so. Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party? When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight. When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight. When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it. In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America. Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~You know, let me say something at the outset. The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media. [applause] This is not a cage match. And, you look at the questions &mdash; "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?" "Ben Carson, can you do math?" "John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?" "Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?" "Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?"How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about? [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Boulder, Colorado~October 28, 2015~You want me to answer that question? I'm happy to answer the question [crosstalk]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Alright. You know, what we do in order to get the information that we need is our business, and I wouldn't necessarily be broadcasting what we're going to do. [applause] We. . .uh. . .we've gotten into this -- this mindset of fighting politically correct wars. There is no such thing as a politically correct war. [applause] And, the left, of course, will say Carson doesn't believe in the Geneva Convention. Carson doesn't believe in fighting stupid wars. And -- and what we have to remember is we want to utilize the tremendous intellect that we have in the military to win wars. And I've talked to a lot of the generals, a lot of our advanced people. And believe me, if we gave them the mission, which is what the commander-in-chief does, they would be able to carry it out. And if we don't tie their hands behind their back, they will do it [timer sounds] extremely effectively. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~And I have a lot more to say about it.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~If Hillary is the candidate, which I doubt, that would be a dream come true. [laughter] But you know, the fact of the matter is, she is the epitome of the progressive -- the secular progressive movement. And she counts on the fact that people are uninformed, the Alinsky Model, taking advantage of useful idiots. Well, I just happen to believe that people are not stupid. [applause] And the way I will come at it is to educate people, help people to actually understand that it is that progressive movement that is causing them the problems. You know, you look at the -- the national debt and how it's being driven up. If I was trying to destroy this country, what I would do is find a way to drive wedges between all the people, drive the debt to an unsustainable level, and then step off the stage as a world leader and let our enemies increase while we decreased our capacity as a military person. And that's what she's doing. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, I could take issue with -- with all of those things, but we don't have time. But I will say, we have a debate here tonight, and we will have an opportunity to explore those areas, and I'm looking very much forward to demonstrating that, in fact, the thing that is probably most important is having a brain, and to be able to figure things out and learn things very rapidly. So, you know, experience comes from a large number of different arenas, and America became a great nation early on not because it was flooded with politicians, but because it was flooded with people who understood the value of personal responsibility, hard work, creativity, innovation, and that's what will get us on the right track now, as well.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, I haven't said anything about me being the only one to do anything, so let me try that. I'm the only one to separate Siamese twins [laughter] The -- the only one to operate on babies while they were still in mother's womb, the only one to take out half of a brain, although you would think, if you go to Washington, that someone had beat me to it. [laughter] But I -- but I'm very hopeful that I'm not the only one who's willing to pick up the baton of freedom, because freedom is not free, and we must fight for it every day. Every one of us must fight for it, because we're fighting for our children and the next generation. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, I think the bully pulpit is a wonderful place to start healing that divide. You know, we have the purveyors of hatred who take every single incident between people of two races and try to make a race war out of it, and drive wedges into people. And this does not need to be done. What we need to think about instead -- you know, I was asked by an NPR reporter once, why don't I talk about race that often. I said it's because I'm a neurosurgeon. And she thought that was a strange response. And you say -- I said, you see, when I take someone to the operating room, I'm actually operating on the thing that makes them who they are. The skin doesn't make them who they are. The hair doesn't make them who they are. And it's time for us to move beyond that. [applause] Because [applause] our strength as a nation comes in our unity. We are the United States of America, not the divided states. And those who want to destroy us are trying to divide us, and we shouldn't let them do it. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, thank you, Megyn, I wasn't sure I was going to get to talk again. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, what we have to stop and think about is that we have weakened ourselves militarily to such an extent that if affects all of our military policies. Our Navy is at its smallest size since 1917; our Air Force, since 1940. In recent testimony, the commandant of the Marine Corps said half of the non-deployed units were not ready and you know, the sequester is cutting the heart out of our personnel. Our generals are retiring because they don't want to be part of this, and at the same time, our enemies are increasing. Our -- our friends can't trust us anymore. You know, Ukraine was a nuclear-armed state. They gave away their nuclear arms with the understanding that we would protect them. We won't even give them offensive weapons. You know, we turned our back on Israel, our ally. You know, in a situation like that, of course Obama's not going to be able to do anything. I would shore up our military first, because if you don't get the military right, nothing else is going to work. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~What I agree with is that we need a significantly changed taxation system. And the one that I've advocated is based on tithing, because I think God is a pretty fair guy. And he said, you know, if you give me a tithe, it doesn't matter how much you made. If you've had a bumper crop, you don't owe me triple tithes. And if you've had no crops at all, you don't owe me no tithes. So there must be something inherently fair about that. And that's why I've advocated a proportional tax system. You make $10 billion, you pay a billion. You make $10, you pay one. And everybody gets treated the same way. And you get rid of the deductions, you get rid of all the loopholes, and [timer sounds]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~When America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place. This is a bad deal. Obama broke every rule of negotiation. Yes, our allies are not perfect, but Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxy. [video clip ends]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~And -- and, Megyn? Megyn, that's a -- that, you know, that's a completely ridiculous answer. "I want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from other people." How are you supposed to know, Megyn?
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~and while still putting our country at risk. [crosstalk]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~And you know -- you know, Senator Paul? Senator Paul, you know, the hugs that I remember are the hugs that I gave to the families who lost their people on September 11th. Those are the hugs I remember, and those had nothing to do -- and those had nothing to do with politics, unlike what you're doing by cutting speeches on the floor of the Senate, then putting them on the Internet within half an hour to raise money for your campaign
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Chris
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~how are you supposed to -- no, I'll tell you how you, look
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~If you think it's bad now, you should've seen it when I got there. [laught and applause] The fact is -- the fact is, in the eight years before I became governor, taxes and fees were raised at the state level 115 times. In the eight years before I became governor, spending was increased 56 percent. And in the eight years before I become governor, taxes and fees were raised at the state level 115 times. In the eight years before I became Governor, spending was increased 56 percent, and in the eight years before I became governor, there was zero net private sector job growth in New Jersey. Zero. For eight years. So, what did we do? We came in, we balanced an $11 billion deficit on a $29 billion budget by cutting over 800 programs in the state budget. We brought the budget into balance with no tax increases. In fact, we vetoed five income tax increases during my time as governor. We cut business taxes $2.3 billion, and we cut regulation by one-third of what my predecessor put in place. And, what's happened since? A hundred ninety-two thousand private sector jobs in the five and a half years I've been governor. We have a lot of work to do in New Jersey, but I am darn proud we've brought our state back. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~is to make sure that you use the system the way it's supposed to work.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Let me tell you something, you go
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Listen, senator, you know, when you're sitting in a subcommittee, just blowing hot air about this, you can say things like that. [applause] When you're responsible for protecting the lives of the American people, then what you need to do is to make sure
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~No, he's not lying, he's just wrong. I mean, so, there's a difference -- I'm the only guy on this stage who's put out a detailed, 12 point plan on entitlement reform and here's why -- because 71% of federal spending right now is on entitlements, and debt service, 71%. And we have spent the last hour and five minutes talking about the other 29%, and no time on the 71%, and that makes no sense. Now, let me tell you exactly what we would do on Social Security. Yes, we'd raise the retirement age two years, and phase it in over 25 years, that means we'd raise it one month a year for 25 years when we're all living longer, and living better lives. Secondly, we would means test Social Security for those who are making over $200,000 dollars a year in retirement income, and have $4 to $5 million dollars in liquid assets saved. They don't need that Social Security check. Social Security is meant to be -- to make sure that no one who's worked hard, and played by the rules, and paid into the system grows old in poverty in America. If we don't deal with this problem, it will bankrupt our country, or lead to massive tax increases, neither one that we want in this country. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~There is no
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, listen. You know, if we want to deal with these issues, we have to deal with them in a way that makes sense. I agree with what Dr. Carson said earlier. The first thing we need to do to make America stronger is to strengthen our military, and I put out a really specific plan: no less than 500,000 active duty soldiers in the Army. No less than 185,000 active duty marines in the Marine Corps. Bring us to a 350 ship Navy again, and modernize the Ohio class of submarines, and bring our Air Force back to 2,600 aircraft that are ready to go. Those are the kind of things that are going to send a clear message around the world. Those are the things that we need to start working on immediately to make our country stronger and make it better. Those are the things that we need to be able to be doing. And as we move towards dealing with foreign aid, I don't disagree with Senator Paul's position that we shouldn't be funding our enemies. But I absolutely believe that Israel is a priority to be able to fund and keep them strong and safe after eight years of this administration. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, thank you, Megyn. Listen, I was born into a middle class family in New Jersey. My dad came home from serving in the Army after having lost his father, worked in the Breyers ice cream plant in Newark, New Jersey. Was the first person to graduate from college. He put himself through college at night. My mom was a secretary. I was appointed United States attorney on September 10, 2001. And I spent the next seven years of my career fighting terrorism and putting terrorists in jail. I'm a conservative, pro-life governor in a state where it is really tough to be both. A state like New Jersey, with lots of Democrats, but still we cut taxes, we balanced budgets. We fought [timer sounds] the teacher's union. This president has had weak leadership, which has led to bad choices. We have got to stop worrying about being loved and start worrying about being respected. And that's exactly how I'll lead our country. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~What are you supposed to
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~When you -- you know, senator  [crosstalk]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Yeah, sure. And, I don't disagree with ending Congress' retirement program. I'm a governor, I don't have a retirement program in my state, and I don't disagree with that. But, here's the news to the American people, he's complaining about the lying and stealing. The lying and stealing has already occurred. The trust fund is filled with IOU's. We can't fix the problem just by ending Congress's retirement, that's worth about, "this" much. We need to go at the fundamental problem, and the fundamental problem is that this system is broken. It has been stolen from. We have been lied to, [timer sounds] and we need a strong leader to tell the truth and fix
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Yes, I do. And I'll tell you why: because I'm the only person on this stage who's actually filed applications under the Patriot Act, who has gone before the federal -- the Foreign Intelligence Service court, who has prosecuted and investigated and jailed terrorists in this country after September 11th. I was appointed U.S. attorney by President Bush on September 10th, 2001, and the world changed enormously the next day, and that happened in my state. This is not theoretical to me. I went to the funerals. We lost friends of ours in the Trade Center that day. My own wife was two blocks from the Trade Center that day, at her office, having gone through it that morning. When you actually have to be responsible for doing this, you can do it, and we did it, for seven years in my office, respecting civil liberties and protecting the homeland. And I will make no apologies, ever, for protecting the lives and the safety of the American people. We have to give more tools to our folks to be able to do that, not fewer, and then trust those people and oversee them to do it the right way. As president, that is exactly what I'll do.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~You know what, Megyn, can I
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~A complete disaster, yes.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~And by the way, this country right now owes $19 trillion. And they need somebody like me to straighten out that mess.[applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~And that's a broken system.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~And the Middle East became totally destabilized. So I just want to say. As far as single payer, it works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you're talking about here. What I'd like to see is a private system without the artificial lines around every state. I have a big company with thousands and thousands of employees. And if I'm negotiating in New York or in New Jersey or in California, I have like one bidder. Nobody can bid. You know why? Because the insurance companies are making a fortune because they have control of the politicians, of course, with the exception of the politicians on this stage. But they have total control of the politicians. They're making a fortune. Get rid of the artificial lines and you will have [timer sounds] yourself great plans. And then we have to take care of the people that can't take care of themselves. And I will do that through a different system. [crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Because I have used the laws of this country just like the greatest people that you read about every day in business have used the laws of this country, the chapter laws, to do a great job for my company, for myself, for my employees, for my family, et cetera.I have never gone bankrupt, by the way. I have never.But out of hundreds of deals
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Border Patrol, I was at the border last week. Border Patrol, people that I deal with, that I talk to, they say this is what's happening. Because our leaders are stupid. Our politicians are stupid. And the Mexican government is much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning. And they send the bad ones over because they don't want to pay for them. They don't want to take care of them. Why should they when the stupid leaders of the United States will do it for them? And that's what is happening whether you like it or not. [cheering and applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~But I [crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Correct.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Excuse me, what am I saying? Out of hundreds of deals that I've done, hundreds, on four occasions I've taken advantage of the laws of this country, like other people. I'm not going to name their names because I'm not going to embarrass, but virtually every person that you read about on the front page of the business sections, they've used the law.The difference is, when somebody else uses those laws, nobody writes about it. When I use it, they say, "Trump, Trump, Trump." The fact is, I built a net worth of more than $10 billion. I have a great, great company. I employ thousands of people. And I'm very proud of the job I did.Again Chris, hundreds and hundreds of deals. Four times, I've taken advantage of the laws. And frankly, so has everybody else in my position.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Excuse me. Excuse me.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~First of all, I'd like to just go back to one. In July of 2004, I came out strongly against the war with Iraq, because it was going to destabilize the Middle East. And I'm the only one on this stage that knew that and had the vision to say it. And that's exactly what happened.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~First of all, Jeb, I am very happy that you denied that, and I appreciate that very much. He is a true gentleman. He really is. One thing he did say, and I mean that. The one thing he did say about me, however, was my tone. And I also understand that. But when you have people that are cutting Christians' heads off, when you have a world that the border and at so many places, that it is medieval times, we've never -- it almost has to be as bad as it ever was in terms of the violence and the horror, we don't have time for tone. [timer sounds] We have to go out and get the job done. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Good.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I'm not -- I'm not are -- I don't think you heard me. You're having a hard time tonight.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I cannot say. I have to respect the person that, if it's not me, the person that wins, if I do win, and I'm leading by quite a bit, that's what I want to do. I can totally make that pledge. If I'm the nominee, I will pledge I will not run as an independent. But -- and I am discussing it with everybody, but I'm, you know, talking about a lot of leverage. We want to win, and we will win. But I want to win as the Republican. I want to run as the Republican nominee.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I don't think they like me very much. I'll tell you what. I've evolved on many issues over the years. And you know who else has? Is Ronald Reagan evolved on many issues. And I am pro-life. And if you look at the question, I was in business. They asked me a question as to pro-life or choice. And I said if you let it run, that I hate the concept of abortion. I hate the concept of abortion. And then since then, I've very much evolved. And what happened is friends of mine years ago were going to have a child, and it was going to be aborted. And it wasn't aborted. And that child today is a total superstar, a great, great child. And I saw that. And I saw other instances. And I am very, very proud to say that I am pro-life. As far as being a Republican is concerned, I come from a place, New York City, which is virtually, I mean, it is almost exclusively Democrat. And I have really started to see some of the negatives -- as an example, and I have a lot of liking for this man, but the last number of months of [timer sounds] his brother's administration were a catastrophe. And unfortunately, those few months gave us President Obama. And you can't be happy about that. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I fully understand.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I have good
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct. [applause] I've been challenged by so many people, and I don't frankly have time for total political correctness. And to be honest with you, this country doesn't have time either. This country is in big trouble. We don't win anymore. We lose to China. We lose to Mexico both in trade and at the border. We lose to everybody. And frankly, what I say, and oftentimes it's fun, it's kidding. We have a good time. What I say is what I say. And honestly Megyn, if you don't like it, I'm sorry. I've been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be, based on the way you have treated me. But I wouldn't do that. [applause] But you know what, we -- we need strength, we need energy, we need quickness and we need brain in this country to turn it around. That, I can tell you right now.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I will not make the pledge at this time.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I would be so different from what you have right now. Like, the polar opposite. We have a president who doesn't have a clue. I would say he's incompetent, but I don't want to do that because that's not nice. [laughter] But if you look at the deals we make, whether it's the nuclear deal with 24 hour periods -- and by the way, before you get to the 24 hours, you have to go through a system. You look at Sgt. Bergdahl, we get Bergdahl, a traitor, and they get five of the big, great killers leaders that they want. We have people in Washington that don't know what they're doing. Now  [applause; scream from audience] I agree. [applause] Now, with Iran, we're making a deal, you would say, we want him. We want out our prisoners. We want all these things, and we don't get anything. We're giving them $150 billion dollars plus, they are going to be -- I'll tell you what, if Iran was a stock, you folks should go out and buy it right now because you'll quadruple -- this, what's happening [timer sounds] in Iran, is a disgrace, and it's going to lead to destruction in large portions of the world. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage I've given to, just so you understand, a lot of money.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Let me just tell you about the lenders. First of all, these lenders aren't babies. These are total killers. These are not the nice, sweet little people that you think, OK? [laughter and applause] You know, I mean you're living in a world of the make-believe, Chris, you want to know the truth. [applause] And I had the good sense to leave Atlantic City, which by the way, Caesars just went bankrupt. Every company, Chris can tell you, every company virtually in Atlantic City went bankrupt. [laughter] Every company.And let me just tell you. I had the good sense, and I've gotten a lot of credit in the financial pages, seven years ago I left Atlantic City before it totally cratered, and I made a lot of money in Atlantic City, and I'm very proud of it. I want to tell you that. Very, very proud of it.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Many of them.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Not much.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Only Rosie O'Donnell. [laughter]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Our country is in serious trouble. We don't win anymore. We don't beat China in trade. We don't beat Japan, with their millions and millions of cars coming into this country, in trade. We can't beat Mexico, at the border or in trade. We can't do anything right. Our military has to be strengthened. Our vets have to be taken care of. We have to end Obamacare, and we have to make our country great again, and I will do that. Thank you.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~So, if it weren't for me, you wouldn't even be talking about illegal immigration, Chris. You wouldn't even be talking about it. [applause]   This was not a subject that was on anybody's mind until I brought it up at my announcement. And I said, Mexico is sending. Except the reporters, because they're a very dishonest lot, generally speaking, in the world of politics, they didn't cover my statement the way I said it. The fact is, since then, many killings ,murders, crime, drugs pouring across the border, are money going out and the drugs coming in. And I said we need to build a wall, and it has to be built quickly. And I don't mind having a big beautiful door in that wall so that people can come into this country legally. But we need, Jeb, to build a wall, we need to keep illegals out. [cheering and applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Sounds good. Sounds good to me, Governor. I will tell you that our system is broken. I gave to many people, before this, before two months ago, I was a businessman. I give to everybody. When they call, I give. And do you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Thank you.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, I
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, I'll tell you what, with Hillary Clinton, I said be at my wedding and she came to my wedding. You know why? She didn't have a choice because I gave. I gave to a foundation that, frankly, that foundation is supposed to do good. I didn't know her money would be used on private jets going all over the world. It was. But [timer sounds] [crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, I've given him plenty of money.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Yes, I'm sure it was.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~You'd better believe it.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Absolutely, I do, and I'm gonna run hard, run with heart, and run to win. I'm gonna have to earn this. Maybe the barrier -- the bar's even higher for me. That's fine. I've got a record in Florida. I'm proud of my dad, and I'm certainly proud of my brother. In Florida, they called me Jeb, because I earned it. I cut taxes every year, totaling $19 billion. We were -- we had -- we balanced every budget. We went from $1 billion of reserves to $9 billion of reserves. We were one of two states that went to AAA bond rating. They keep -- they called me Veto Corleone. Because I vetoed 2,500 separate line-items in the budget. [applause] I am my own man. I governed as a conservative, and I govern effectively. And the net effect was, during my eight years, 1.3 million jobs were created. We left the state better off because I applied conservative principles in a purple state the right way, and people rose up. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~He is definitely my friend. And I think the states ought to create these standards. And if states want to opt out of Common Core, fine. Just make sure your standards are high. Because today in America, a third of our kids, after we spend more per student than any country in the world other than a couple rounding errors, to be honest with you, 30 percent are college- and/or career-ready. If we are going to compete in this world we're in today, there is no possible way we can do it with lowering expectations and dumbing down everything. Children are going to suffer and families' hearts are going to be broken that their kids won't be able to get a job in the 21st Century. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Here's what I believe. I believe we're at the verge of the greatest time to be alive in this world. But Washington is holding us back. How we tax, how we regulate. We're not embracing the energy revolution in our midst, a broken immigration system that has been politicized rather than turning it into an economic driver. We're not protecting and preserving our entitlement system or reforming for the next generation. All these things languish while we have politicians in Washington using these as wedge issues. Here's my commitment to you, because I did it as Florida. We can fix these things. We can grow economically and restore America's leadership in the world, so that everybody has a chance to rise up. I humbly ask for your vote, whenever you're gonna get to vote, whenever the primary is. Thank you all very much.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I do. I believe that the great majority of people coming here illegally have no other option. They want to provide for their family. But we need to control our border. It's not -- it's our responsibility to pick and choose who comes in. So I -- I've written a book about this and yet this week, I did come up with a comprehensive strategy that -- that really mirrored what we said in the book, which is that we need to deal with E-Verify, we need to deal with people that come with a legal visa and overstay. We need to be much more strategic on how we deal with border enforcement, border security. We need to eliminate the sanctuary cities in this country. It is ridiculous and tragic [applause] that people are dying because of the fact that -- that local governments are not following the federal law. There's much to do. And I think rather than talking about this as a wedge issue, which Barack Obama has done now for six long years, the next president -- and I hope to be that president -- will fix this once and for all so that we can turn this into a driver for high sustained economic growth. And there should be a path to earned legal status [timer sounds]    for those that are here. Not -- not amnesty, earned legal status, which means you pay a fine and do many things over an extended period of time.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I remember
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I remember, Megyn. [laughter]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Knowing what we know now, with faulty intelligence, and not having security be the first priority when -- when we invaded, it was a mistake. I wouldn't have gone in, however, for the people that did lose their lives, and the families that suffer because of it -- I know this full well because as governor of the state of Florida, I called every one of them. Every one of them that I could find to tell them that I was praying for them, that I cared about them, and it was really hard to do. And, every one of them said that their child did not die in vain, or their wife, of their husband did not die in vain. So, why it was difficult for me to do it was based on that. Here's the lesson that we should take from this, which relates to this whole subject. Barack Obama became president, and he abandoned Iraq. He left, and when he left Al Qaida was done for. ISIS was created because [timer sounds] of the void that we left, and that void now exists as a caliphate the size of Indiana. To honor the people that died, we need to -- we need to --- stop the -- Iran agreement, for sure, because the Iranian mullahs have their blood on their hands, and we need to take out ISIS with every tool at our disposal. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~No, I don't. And I don't believe the federal government should be involved in the creation of standards directly or indirectly, the creation of curriculum or content. It is clearly a state responsibility. I'm for higher standards  [applause]  measured in an intellectually honest way, with abundant school choice, ending social promotion. And I know how to do this because as governor of the state of Florida I created the first statewide voucher program in the country, the second statewide voucher program, in the country and the third statewide voucher program in the country. And we had rising student achievement across the board, because high standards, robust accountability, ending social promotion in third grade, real school choice across the board, challenging the teachers union and beating them is the way to go. And Florida's low income kids had the greatest gains inside the country. Our graduation rate improved by 50 percent. That's what I'm for.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~No. It's not true. But I have said that Mr. Trump's language is divisive. I want to win. I want one of these people here or the ones at 5:00, to be the next president of the United States. We're not going on win by doing what Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton do each and every day. Dividing the country. Saying, creating a grievance kind of environment. We're going to win when we unite people with a hopeful, optimistic message. I have that message because I was a governor of a state that saw people lifted up, because we had high sustained economic growth. Our economy grew at double the rate of the nation. We created 1.3 million jobs. We led the nation seven out of those eight years. We were only one of two states that went to AAA bond rating. I cut taxes, $19 billion. If you do that and apply conservative principles the right way, you create an environment where everybody rises up. That's how we're going to win. Campaigning in places to give people hope that their life is better because too many people are suffering today in America.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~None of which is true.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~We've done it 27 times since World War II. I think we need to lift our spirits and have high, lofty expectations for this great country of ours. The new normal of two percent that the left is saying you can't do anything about is so dangerous for our country. There's 6 million people living in poverty today, more than when Barack Obama got elected. 6.5 million people are working part-time, most of whom want to work full-time. We've created rules and taxes on top of every aspiration of people, and the net result is we're not growing fast, income's not growing. A four percent growth strategy means you fix a convoluted tax code. You get in and you change every aspect of regulations that are job killers. You get rid of Obamacare and replace it with something that doesn't suppress wages and kill jobs. [applause] You embrace the energy revolution in our country. This president and Hillary Clinton, who can't even say she's for the XL pipeline even after she's left? Give me a break. Of course we're for it. We should be for these things to create high sustained economic growth. And frankly, [timer sounds] fixing our immigration system and turning it into an economic driver is part of this as well. We can do this. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~-- this campaign, I hope you will give to me.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~But the point is that we all have solutions. Mr. Trump is touching a nerve because people want the wall to be built. They want to see an end to illegal immigration. They want to see it, and we all do. But we all have different ways of getting there. And you're going to hear from all of us tonight about what our ideas are.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Chris, first of all, I was just saying to Chris Christie, they say we're outspoken, we need to take lessons from Donald Trump if we're really going to learn it. Here is the thing about Donald Trump. Donald Trump is hitting a nerve in this country. He is. He's hitting a nerve. People are frustrated. They're fed up. They don't think the government is working for them. And for people who want to just tune him out, they're making a mistake. Now, he's got his solutions. Some of us have other solutions. You know, look, I balanced the federal budget as one of the chief architects when I was in Washington. Hasn't been done since. I was a military reformer. I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole and a 350,000 job loss to a $2 billion surplus and a gain of 350,000 jobs.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Let's start off with my father being a mailman. So I understand the concerns of all the folks across this country, some of whom have trouble, you know, making ends meet. But I think she will come in a narrow way. The nominee of this party, if they're going to win, has got to come at it in a big way, which is pro-growth. Which is balancing budgets. You know, we were talking about it. People were saying, could we do it? I was the chairman of the Budget Committee and the lead architect the last time it happened in Washington, and when we did it we had great economic growth, we cut taxes, and we had a big surplus. Economic growth is the key. Economic growth is the key to everything. But once you have economic growth, it is important that we reach out to people who live in the shadows, the people who don't seem to ever think that they get a fair deal. And that includes people in our minority community; that includes people who feel as though they don't have a chance to move up. You know, America is a miracle country. And we have to restore the sense that the "Amiracle" will apply to you. Each and every one of the people in this country who's watching tonight, lift everybody, [timer sounds] unite everybody and build a stronger United States of America again. It will be and can be done.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~OK.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Wait, Megyn, the court has ruled, and I said we'll accept it. And guess what, I just went to a wedding of a friend of mine who happens to be gay. Because somebody doesn't think the way I do, doesn't mean that I can't care about them or can't love them. So if one of my daughters happened to be that, of course I would love them and I would accept them. Because you know what? [applause] That's what we're taught when we have strong faith. [applause] So the issues like that, issues like that are planted to divide us. I think the simple fact of the matter is, and this is where I would agree with Jeb, and I've been saying it all along, we need to give everybody a chance, treat everybody with respect, and let them share in this great American dream that we have, Megan. So, look, I'm going to love my daughters, I'm going to love them no matter what they do. Because, you know what, [timer sounds] God gives me unconditional love. I'm going to give it to my family and my friends and the people around me.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, first of all  [applause]    first of all, Megyn, you should know that -- that President Reagan expanded Medicaid three or four times. Secondly, I had an opportunity to bring resources back to Ohio to do what? To treat the mentally ill. Ten thousand of them sit in our prisons. It costs $22,500 a year  [applause]    to keep them in prison. I'd rather get them their medication so they could lead a decent life. Secondly, we are rehabbing the drug-addicted. Eighty percent of the people in our prisons have addictions or problems. We now treat them in the prisons, release them in the community and the recidivism rate is 10 percent and everybody across this country knows that the tsunami of drugs is -- is threatening their very families. So we're treating them and getting them on their feet. And, finally, the working poor, instead of them having come into the emergency rooms where it costs more, where they're sicker and we end up paying, we brought a program in here to make sure that people could get on their feet. And do you know what? Everybody has a right to their God-given purpose. And finally, our Medicaid is growing at one of the lowest rates in the country. And, finally, we went from $8 billion in the hole to $2 billion in the black. We've cut $5 billion in taxes  [timer sounds]  and we've grown 350,000 jobs. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, look, I'm an old-fashioned person here, and I happen to believe in traditional marriage. But I've also said the court has ruled --
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, Megyn, my father was a mailman. His father was a coal miner. My mother's mother could barely speak English. And their son today stands on this podium in the great state of Ohio not only as the governor, but a candidate for president of the United States. [cheering and applause] I do believe in miracles. You know, I've had a lot of elections. But my elections are really not about campaigns. I tell my people that these are about a movement. And a movement to do what? To restore common sense. A movement to do things like provide economic growth. And a movement not to let anybody be behind. You know, today the country is divided. You asked a question about the police and the difficulty in communities. We've got to unite our country again, because we're stronger when we are united and we are weaker when we are divided. And we've got to listen to other people's voices, respect them, but keep in mind, and I believe in terms of the things that I've read in my lifetime, the Lord'is not picking us. But because of how we respect human rights, because that we are a good force in the world, he wants America to be strong. He wants America to succeed. And he wants America to lead. And nothing is more important to me than my family, my faith, and my friends. [cheering and applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~You know, tonight we hear about what people want to do. I want to tell you what I've done. I was a member of the Armed Services Committee for 18 years. I spent a big chunk of my life studying national security issues and our role in the world. No. 2. I was the chairman of the House Budget Committee and one of the chief architects the last time we balanced a budget, and it was the first time we had done it since man walked on the moon. We had a $5 trillion surplus and we cut taxes. I spent ten years in the private sector, actually learning how business works. And now I'm the governor of Ohio, and I inherited a state that was on the brink [timer sounds] of dying. And we turned it all around with jobs and balanced budgets and rising credit and tax cuts, and the state is unified, and people have hope again in Ohio. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Actually, to be clear [crosstalk] he supported Charlie Crist.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Hey, Charlie [crosstalk]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I have never said that. And I have never advocated that. What I have advocated is that we pass law in this country that says all human life at every stage of its development is worthy of protection. In fact, I think that law already exists. It is called the Constitution of the United States. [applause] And let me go further. I believe that every single human being is entitled to the protection of our laws, whether they can vote or not. Whether they can speak or not. Whether they can hire a lawyer or not. Whether they have a birth certificate or not. And I think future generations will look back at this history of our country and call us barbarians for murdering millions of babies who we never gave them a chance to live. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Let me set the record straight on a couple of things. The first is, the evidence is now clear that the majority of people coming across the border are not from Mexico. They're coming from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras. Those countries are the source of the people that are now coming in its majority. I also believe we need a fence. The problem is if El Chapo builds a tunnel under the fence, we have to be able to deal with that too. And that's why you need an e-verify system and you need an entry-exit tracking system and all sorts of other things to prevent illegal immigration. But I agree with what Governor Kasich just said. People are frustrated. This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration. There are a million people a year who legally immigrate to the United States, and people feel like we're being taken advantage of. We feel like despite our generosity, we're being taken advantage of. And let me tell you who never gets talked about in these debates. The people that call my office, who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States. And they've paid their fees, and they hired a lawyer, and they can't get in. And they're wondering, maybe they should come illegally. [applause] And so these are important issues, and we should address it. It's a serious problem that needs to be addressed, and otherwise we're going to keep talking about this for the next 30 years, like we have for the last 30 years.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Not me.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Thank you. You know, both of my parents were born into poor families on the island of Cuba. They came to America because it was the only place where people like them could have a chance. Here in this country, they never made it big, but the very purpose of their life was to give us the chance to do all the things they never could. My father was a bartender. And the journey from the back of that bar to this stage tonight, to me, that is the essence of the American dream. It is what makes our nation different. And I'm running for president because I want that to still be possible for the people trying to do that now. I run for president because I believe that we can't just save the American dream; we can expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before. And that's why I'm asking for your vote. So we can make America greater than it has ever been. And make of this century a new American century. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~That's a great question.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~That's a great question.First of all, it begins by having leaders that recognize that the economy we live in today is dramatically different from the one we had five years ago. It's an economy that now has placed us in global competition with dozens of other countries around the world.Now, the big companies that have connections with Washington, they can affect policies to help them, but the small companies like the one Tania is talking about, they're the ones that are struggling.The first thing we need to do is we need to even out the tax code for small businesses so that we lower their tax rate to 25 percent, just as we need to lower it for all businesses.We need to have a regulatory budget in America that limits the amount of regulations on our economy. We need to repeal and replace Obamacare and we need to improve higher education so that people can have access to the skills they need for 21st century jobs.And last but not least, we need to repeal Dodd-Frank. It is eviscerating small businesses and small banks. [applause] 20  over 40 percent of small and mid-size banks that loan money to small businesses have been wiped out over the  since Dodd-Frank has passed. We need to repeal and replace Dodd-Frank. We need to make America fair again for all businesses, but especially those being run by small business owners.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, first off, I too believe in curriculum reform. It is critically important in the 21st Century. We do need curriculum reform. And it should happen at the state and local level. That's. . . that's. . . that is where educational policy belongs, because if a parent is unhappy with what their child is being taught in school, they can go to that local school board or their state legislature, or their governor and get it changed. Here's the problem with Common Core. The Department of Education, like every federal agency, will never be satisfied. They will not stop with it being a suggestion. They will turn it into a mandate. In fact, what they will begin to say to local communities is, you will not get federal money unless do you things the way we want you to do it. And they will use Common Core or any other requirements that exists nationally to force it down the throats of our people in our states. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, first, let me say I think God has blessed us. He has blessed the Republican Party with some very good candidates. The Democrats can't even find one. [laughter] [cheering and applause] And I believe God has blessed our country. This country has been extraordinarily blessed. And we have honored that blessing. And that's why God has continued to bless us. And he has blessed us with young men and women willing to risk their lives and sometimes die in uniform for the safety and security of our people. Unfortunately today we have a VA that does not do enough for them. I am proud that last year we helped change the law. We changed the law to give the power to the VA secretary the ability to fire any executive that isn't doing their job. And it is outrageous they've only fired one person to date. When I'm president of the United States, we're going to have a VA that cares more about our veterans than about the bureaucrats who work at the VA. [cheering and applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, Megyn, first of all, I'm not sure that that's a correct assessment of my record. I would go on to add that I believe all--
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, thank you for the question, Chris, and it's great to be here tonight. Let me begin by saying this: I'm not new to the political process; I was making a contribution as the speaker of the third largest and most diverse state in the country well before I even got into the Senate. I would add to that that this election cannot be a resume competition. It's important to be qualified, but if this election is a resume competition, then Hillary Clinton's gonna be the next president, because she's been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight. Here's what this election better be about: This election better be about the future, not the past. It better be about the issues our nation and the world is facing today, not simply the issues we once faced. This country is facing an economy that has been radically transformed. You know, the largest retailer in the country and the world today, Amazon, doesn't even own a single store? And these changes have been disruptive. They have changed people's lives. The jobs that once sustained our middle class, they either don't pay enough or they are gone, and we need someone that understands that as our nominee. If I'm our nominee, how is Hillary Clinton gonna lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck? I was raised paycheck to paycheck. How is she -- how is she gonna lecture me -- how is she gonna lecture me about student loans? I owed over $100,000 just four years ago. If I'm our nominee, we will be the party of the future. [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Chris, I disagree with the idea that the real issue is a constitutional amendment. That's a long and difficult process. I've actually taken the position that's bolder than that. A lot of people are talking about defunding planned parenthood, as if that's a huge game changer. I think it's time to do something even more bold. I think the next president ought to invoke the Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the constitution now that we clearly know that that baby inside the mother's womb is a person at the moment of conception. The reason we know that it is is because of the DNA schedule that we now have clear scientific evidence on. And, this notion that we just continue to ignore the personhood of the individual is a violation of that unborn child's Fifth and 14th Amendment rights for due process and equal protection under the law. It's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the Supreme Being, and we change the policy to be pro-life and protect children instead of rip up their body parts and sell them like they're parts to a Buick. [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~is in trouble, but it's not beyond repair. But it's going to take leadership who sees the greatness of this country, and who believes that once again we can be one nation, under God. I'll be my best to do that, and thank you for your support. [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~It's not too big to shrink. But the problem is we have a Wall Street-to-Washington axis of power that has controlled the political climate. The donor class feeds the political class who does the dance that the donor class wants. And the result is federal government keeps getting bigger. Every person on this stage who has been a governor will tell that you the biggest fight they had was not the other party. Wasn't even the legislature. It was the federal government, who continually put mandates on the states that we had to suck up and pay for. And the fact is there are a lot of things happening at the federal level that are absolutely beyond the jurisdiction of the Constitution. This is power that should be shifted back to the states, whether it's the EPA, there is no role at the federal level for the Department of Education. [cheering and applause] And I'm still one who says that we can get rid of the Internal Revenue Service if we would pass the FairTax, which is a tax on consumption rather than a tax on people's income, and move power back where the founders believed it should have been all along.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~It has to do with the incredibly dangerous place that this world is gonna be as a result of a deal in which we got nothing. We didn't even get four hostages out. We got nothing, and Iran gets everything they want. We said we would have anywhere, anytime negotiations and inspections, we gave that up. We said that we would make sure that they didn't have any nuclear capacity, we gave that up. The president can't tell us what we got. I'll tell you what the world got. The world has a burgeoning nuclear power that didn't, as the Soviets, say "we might defend ourselves in a war." What the Iranians have said is, "we will wipe Israel off the face of the map, and we will bring death to America." When someone points a gun at your head [timer sounds] and loads it, by God, you ought to take them seriously, and we need to take that seriously.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~It seems like this election has been a whole lot about a person who's very high in the polls, that doesn't have a clue about how to govern. A person who has been filled with scandals, and who could not lead, and, of course, I'm talking about Hillary Clinton. [laughter] I think America
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Not me. [laughter]   But you're welcome to give me a check, Donald if you'd like.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Ronald Reagan said "trust, but verify." President Obama is "trust, but vilify." He trusts our enemies and vilifies everyone who disagrees with him. And the reason we disagree with him has nothing to do with party. [applause] [crosstalk]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~The military is not a social experiment. The purpose of the military is kill people and break things. [applause] It's not to transform the culture by trying out some ideas that some people think would make us a different country and more diverse. The purpose is to protect America. I'm not sure how paying for transgender surgery for soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines makes our country safer. We've reduced the military by 25 percent  [applause]   under President Obama. The disaster is that we've forgotten why we have a military. The purpose of it is to make sure that we protect every American, wherever that American is, and if an American is calling out for help, whether it's in Benghazi or at the border, then we ought to be able to answer it. We've not done that because we've decimated our military. We're flying B-52s. The most recent one that was put in service was November of 1962. A lot of the B-52s we're flying, we've only got 44 that are in service combat ready, and the fact is, most of them are older than me. And that's pretty scary.  [laughter and applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, let's all be reminded, 60 million Americans are on Social Security, 60 million. A third of those people depend on 90% of their income from Social Security. Nobody in this country is on Social Security because they made the decision when they were starting work at 14 that they wanted to trust some of their money with the government. The government took it out of their check whether they wanted them to or not. And, if person goes to 65, they're going to spend 51 years with the government reaching into their pocket at every paycheck. Now, here's the point, whose fault is it that the system is screwed up? Is it the recipients, or is it the government? And, if Congress wants to mess with the retirement program, why don't we let them start by changing their retirement program, and not have one, instead of talking about getting rid of Social Security and Medicare that was robbed $700 billion dollars to pay for Obamacare. It's always that the government figures that they can do this off the backs of people, many of whom are poor, and depend on that money, and I just think it's fundamentally lying to the people and stealing from them, and we shouldn't be doing it. [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, you ask about how we fund it. One of the reasons that Social Security is in so much trouble is that the only funding stream comes from people who get a wage. The people who get wages is declining dramatically. Most of the income in this country is made by people at the top who get dividends and -- and capital gains. The FairTax transforms the process by which we fund Social Security and Medicare because the money paid in consumption is paid by everybody, including illegals, prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers, all the people [timer sounds] that are freeloading off the system now. [applause] That's why it ought to be a transformed system. [applause]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~-- for a decade. So I think you're on the wrong side of this if you're still arguing for a single-payer system.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~and I've said -- and I've said I would cut spending, and I've said exactly where. Each one of my budgets has taken a meat axe to foreign aid, because I think we ought to quit sending it to countries that hate us. [applause] I think we ought to quit sending it to countries that burn our flag. Israel is not one of those. But even Benjamin Netanyahu said that ultimately, they will be stronger when they're independent. My position is exactly the same. We shouldn't borrow money from China to send it anywhere, but why don't we start with eliminating aid to our enemies.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~but I'd say that he's already hedging his bets because he's used to buying politicians.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~First of all, only ISIS is responsible for the terrorism. Only ISIS is responsible for the depravity. But, we do have to examine, how are we going to defeat ISIS? I've got a proposal. I'm the leading voice in America for not arming the allies of ISIS. [applause]    I've been fighting amidst a lot of opposition from both Hillary Clinton, as well as some Republicans who wanted to send arms to the allies of ISIS. ISIS rides around in a billion dollars worth of U.S. Humvees. It's a disgrace. We've got to stop -- we shouldn't fund our enemies, for goodness sakes.   So, we didn't create ISIS -- ISIS created themselves, but we will stop them, and one of the ways we stop them is by not funding them, and not arming them. [applause]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Get a judge to sign the warrant!
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Get a warrant!
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Here's the problem, governor. Here's the problem, governor. You fundamentally misunderstand the Bill of Rights. Every time you did a case, you got a warrant from a judge. I'm talking about searches without warrants
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Hey, look, look! He's already hedging his bet on the Clintons, OK? So if he doesn't run as a Republican, maybe he supports Clinton, or maybe he runs as an independent
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I'm a different kind of Republican. I've introduced a five-year balanced budget. I've introduced the largest tax cut in our history. I stood for ten and a half hours on the Senate floor to defend your right to be left alone. [applause] But I've also gone to Chicago. I've gone to Detroit. I've been to Ferguson, I've been to Baltimore, because I want our party to be bigger, better and bolder, and I'm the only one that leads Hillary Clinton in five states that were won by President Obama. I'm a different kind of Republican. [applause]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I've got a news flash
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I mean, this is what's wrong. He buys and sells politicians of all stripes, he's already
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I oppose the Iranian deal, and will vote against it. I don't think that the president negotiated from a position of strength, but I don't immediately discount negotiations. I'm a Reagan conservative. Reagan did negotiate with the Soviets. But you have to negotiate from a position of strength, and I think President Obama gave away too much, too early. If there's going to be a negotiation, you're going to have to believe somehow that the Iranians are going to comply. And I asked this question to John Kerry, I said "do you believe they're trustworthy?" and he said "No." And I said, "well, how are we gonna get them to comply?" I would have never released the sanctions before there was consistent evidence of compliance.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I still say exactly what my original opinion is. Do you borrow money from China to send it to anyone? Out of your surplus, you can help your allies, and Israel is a great ally. And this is no particular animus of Israel, but what I will say, and I will say over and over again, we cannot give away money we don't have. We do not project power from bankruptcy court. We're borrowing a million dollars a minute. [applause] It's got to stop somewhere.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from innocent Americans. The Fourth Amendment was what we fought the Revolution over! John Adams said it was the spark that led to our war for independence, and I'm proud of standing for the Bill of Rights, and I will continue to stand for the Bill of Rights. [applause]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~indiscriminately, of all Americans' records, and that's what I fought to end. I don't trust President Obama with our records. I know you gave him a big hug, and if you want to give him a big hug again, go right ahead. [applause]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Look, I don't want my marriage or my guns registered in Washington. And if people have an opinion, it's a religious opinion that is heartly felt, obviously they should be allowed to practice that and no government should interfere with them. One of the things, one of the things that really got to me was the thing in Houston where you had the government, the mayor actually, trying to get the sermons of ministers. When the government tries to invade the church to enforce its own opinion on marriage, that's when it's time to resist.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Megyn, may I respond? [applause] May I respond?
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~News flash, the Republican Party's been fighting against a single-payer system
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~See, here's the problem.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~This is what's wrong!
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Use the Fourth Amendment!
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, let's be clear, I'm the only one on the stage who actually has a five-year budget that balances. I've put pencil to paper
Rick Perry~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I will tell you one thing: I would whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry. Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away. But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but hell no, to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror  [video clip ends] [video clip begins]
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Chris, I actually said that on your show earlier this year. [crosstalk] I acknowledged that. I said I actually listened to the American people. And I think people across America want a leader who's actually going to listen to them. I talked to border state governors and other elected officials. I look at how this president, particularly through last November, messed up the immigration system in this country. Most importantly, I listened to the people of America. I believe we need to secure the border. I've been to the border with Governor Abbott in Texas and others, seeing the problems that they have there. There is international criminal organizations penetrating our southern based borders, and we need to do something about it. Secure the border, enforce the law, no amnesty, and go forward with the legal immigration system that gives priority to American working families and wages. [applause]
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~I don't know about additional ones. We need to focus on the ones we have. You look at Egypt, probably the best relationship we've had in Israel, at least in my lifetime, incredibly important. You look at the Saudis -- in fact, earlier this year, I met with Saudi leaders, and leaders from the United Arab Emirates, and I asked them what's the greatest challenge in the world today? Set aside the Iran deal. They said it's the disengagement of America. We are leading from behind under the Obama-Clinton doctrine -- America's a great country. We need to stand up and start leading again, and we need to have allies, not just in Israel, but throughout the Persian Gulf.
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~It's true.
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Just one second on this, though. We -- we spent a lot of time talking about Hillary Clinton and ---and pitting us back and forth. Let's be clear, we should be talking about Hillary Clinton on that last subject, because everywhere in the world that Hillary Clinton touched is more messed up today than before she and the president [inaudible].
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Thanks. I'm guy with a wife and two kids, and Harley. One article called me "aggressively normal." I ran for governor because I was worried about my kids' future. Then, I took on the big government union bosses, and we won. They tried to recall me, and we won. They target us again, and we won. We balanced the budget, cut taxes, and turned our state around with big, bold reforms. It wasn't too late for Wisconsin, and it's not too late for America. That's why I ask for your vote.
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well first off, for the cyber attack with Russia the other day, it's sad to think right now, but probably the Russian and Chinese government know more about Hillary Clinton's e-mail server than do the members of the United States Congress. [laughter and applause] And -- and that has put our national security at risk. If I am president, he won't think about that. You know, Putin believes in the old Lenin adage: you probe with bayonets. When you find mush, you push. When you find steel, you stop. Under Obama and Clinton, we found a lot of mush over the last two years. We need to have a national security that puts steel in front of our enemies. I would send weapons to Ukraine. I would work with NATO to put forces on the eastern border of Poland and the Baltic nations, and I would reinstate, put in place back in the missile defense system that we had in Poland and in the Czech Republic. [applause] We find steel.
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, first off, let's remember. I still remember, as a kid, tying a yellow ribbon around a tree in front of my house during the 444 days that Iran held 52 Americans hostage. Iran is not a place we should be doing business with. To me, you terminate the deal on day one, you reinstate the sanctions authorized by Congress, you go to Congress and put in place even more crippling sanctions in place, and then you convince our allies to do the same. This is not just bad with Iran, this is bad with ISIS. It is tied together, and, once and for all, we need a leader who's gonna stand up and do something about it. It's yet another example of the failed foreign policy of the Obama-Clinton doctrine. [applause]
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, I'm pro-life, I've always been pro-life, and I've got a position that I think is consistent with many Americans out there in that  [applause]    in that I believe that that is an unborn child that's in need of protection out there, and I've said many a time that that unborn child can be protected, and there are many other alternatives that can also protect the life of that mother. That's been consistently proven. Unlike Hillary Clinton, who has a radical position in terms of support for Planned Parenthood, I defunded Planned Parenthood more than four years ago, long before any of these videos came out  [applause]  I've got a position that's in line with everyday America. [applause]
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, I think the most important thing we can do when it comes to policing -- it's something you've had a guest on who's a friend of mine Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clark, who's talked to me about this many times in the past -- it's about training. It's about making sure that law enforcement professionals, not only in the way in to their positions but all the way through their time, have the proper training, particularly when it comes to the use of force. And that we protect and stand up and support those men and women who are doing their jobs in law enforcement. And for the very few that don't, that there are consequences to show that we treat everyone the same here in America.
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, thanks, Megyn. I'm certainly an imperfect man. And it's only by the blood of Jesus Christ that I've been redeemed from my sins. So I know that God doesn't call me to do a specific thing, God hasn't given me a list, a Ten Commandments, if you will, of things to act on the first day. What God calls us to do is follow his will. And ultimately that's what I'm going to try to do. And I hope people've seen it in my state, even in the big challenges I took on when I had over 100,000 protesters in and around our capital, trying to do what I thought was the right thing. It wasn't just how I took on those political battles. It was ultimately how I acted. Not responding in kind. Not lashing out. But just being decent going forward and living my life in a way that would be a testimony to him and our faith. [applause]
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, the voters in Wisconsin elected me last year for the third time because they wanted someone who aimed high, not aimed low. Before I came in, the unemployment rate was over eight percent. It's now down to 4.6 percent. We've more than made up for the jobs that were lost during the recession. And the rate in which people are working is almost five points higher than it is nationally. You know, people like Hillary Clinton think you grow the economy by growing Washington. One report last year showed that six of the top 10 wealthiest counties in America were in or around Washington, D.C.. I think most of us in America understand that people, not the government creates jobs. And one of the best things we can do is get the government out of the way, repeal Obamacare, put in -- reign in all the out of control regulations, put in place an all of the above energy policy, give people the education, the skills that the need to succeed, and lower the tax rate and reform the tax code. That's what I'll do as president, just like I did in Wisconsin. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Brett, can I -- Brett, can I jump in on this one?
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Chris, absolutely yes. And not only will I support it [applause] I have authored Kate's law in the United States Senate and filed that legislation. I tried to get the Senate to vote to pass Kate's law on the floor of the Senate just one week ago, and the leader of our own party blocked a vote on Kate's law. You know, there was reference made to our leaders being stupid. It's not a question of stupidity. It's that they don't want to enforce the immigration laws. That there are far too many in the Washington cartel that support amnesty. President Obama has talked about fundamentally transforming this country. There's 7 billion people across the face of the globe, many of whom want to come to this country. If they come legally, great. But if they come illegally and they get amnesty, that is how we fundamentally change this country, and it really is striking. A majority of the candidates on this stage have supported amnesty. I have never supported amnesty, and I led the fight against Chuck Schumer's gang of eight amnesty legislation in the Senate.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Chris, I believe the American people are looking for someone to speak the truth. [applause] If you're looking for someone to go to Washington, to go along to get along, to get -- to agree with the career politicians in both parties who get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests, then I ain't your guy. There is a reason  [applause]  . that we have $18 trillion in debt. Because as conservatives, as Republicans, we keep winning elections. We got a Republican House, we've got a Republican Senate, and we don't have leaders who honor their commitments. I will always tell the truth and do what I said I would do. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~If I'm elected president, let me tell you about my first day in office. The first thing I intend to do is to rescind every illegal and unconstitutional executive action taken by Barack Obama. [applause] The next thing I intend to do is instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into these videos and to prosecute Planned Parenthood for any criminal violations. [applause] The next thing I intend to do is instruct the Department of Justice and the IRS to start (sic) persecuting religious liberty, and then intend to cancel the Iran deal, and finally move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. [applause] I will keep my word. My father fled Cuba, and I will fight to defend liberty because my family knows what it's like to lose it.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Megyn, of course it's an ideological problem, that's one of the reasons I introduce the Expatriate Terrorist Act in the Senate that said if any American travels to the Middle East and joining ISIS, that he or she forfeits their citizenship so they don't use a passport to come back and wage jihad on Americans. [applause] Yes, it is ideological, and let me contrast President Obama, who at the prayer breakfast, essentially acted as an apologist. He said, "Well, gosh, the crusades, the inquisitions--"[timer sounds] We need a president that shows the courage that Egypt's President al-Sisi did, a Muslim, when he called out the radical Islamic terrorists who are threatening the world. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Megyn, we need a commander in chief that speaks the truth. We will not defeat radical Islamic terrorism so long as we have a president unwilling to utter the words, "radical Islamic terrorism". [applause] When I asked General Dempsey, the chairman of the joint chiefs, what would be required militarily to destroy ISIS, he said there is no military solution. We need to change the conditions on the ground so that young men are not in poverty and susceptible to radicalization. That, with all due respect, is nonsense. It's the same answer the State Department gave that we need to give them jobs. What we need is a commander in chief who makes -- clear, if you join ISIS, if you wage jihad on America, then you are signing your death warrant.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, Bret, of course they have, and over the last six and a half years we've seen the consequences of the Obama-Clinton foreign policy. Leading from behind is a disaster. We have abandoned and alienated our friends and allies, and our enemies are stronger. Radical Islam is on the rise, Iran's on the verge of acquiring a nuclear weapon, China is waging cyber warfare against America, Russia -- General Soleimani, you just mentioned, the Iranian general is the head of the al Quds forces. He's directly responsible for the murder of over 500 American servicemen in Iraq, and part of this Iranian deal was lifting the international sanctions on General Soleimani. The day General Soleimani flew back from Moscow to Iran was the day we believed that Russia used cyber warfare against the Joint Chiefs. We need a new commander in chief that will stand up to our enemies, and that will have credibility  [applause] It is worth emphasizing that Iran released our hostages in 1981 the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio~August 6, 2015~Well, I am blessed to receive a word from God every day in receiving the scriptures and reading the scriptures. And God speaks through the Bible. [applause] I'm the son of a pastor and evangelist and I've described many times how my father, when I was a child, was an alcoholic. He wasn't a Christian. And my father left my mother and left me when I was just three years old. And someone invited him to Clay Road Baptist Church. And he gave his heart to Jesus and it turned him around. And he got on a plane and he flew back to my mother and me. [applause] I would also note that the scripture tells us, "you shall know them by their fruit." We see lots of "campaign conservatives." But if we're going to win in 2016, we need a consistent conservative, someone who has been a fiscal conservative, a social conservative, a national security conservative. There are real differences among the candidates on issues like amnesty, like Obamacare, like religious liberty, like life and marriage. And I have been proud to fight and stand for religious liberty, to stand against Planned Parenthood, to defend life for my entire career. And I will be proud to continue to do so as president of the United States. [cheering and applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~I want to thank the people of Iowa for being so welcoming to me. Please think of our founding fathers as you listen. We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the benefits of liberty to ourselves and our prosperity, do ordain and establish this constitution of the United States of America. Folks, it's not too late. Enough said. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Look, first of all, I recognize that Vladimir Putin is an opportunist and he's a bully, and we have to face him down. And I would &mdash; first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region. I think we need to put in some armored brigades there. We only have one or two. We need much more than that. We need to be doing military exercises if not only Estonia but Latvia and Lithuania. They're terrified by the saber rattling. I think we ought to put in our missile defense system.I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country: oil and energy. And we ought to fight them on that level.We ought to be helping in terms of the technology for fracking, keeping the price low, quite frankly, because that's what's keeping him contained. So, yes, I'd absolutely would go in if he attacked. I think on Article IV of NATO, we would definitely protect all of our allies. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Oh, great. [laughter]As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that's one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.Now, I recognize that the vast majority of people coming in here probably are not those kinds of people, but that's not good enough. If you've got 10 people coming to your house and you know one of them is a terrorist, you're probably going to keep them all out.You know, we probably have to figure out a way to make sure that we keep America safe. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, as anyone knows who's been listening to me, you know? I'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know? We last year there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations. If you stack that up it would be a three-story building. This is absolutely absurd. And, they've insinuated themselves into everything.Now, as far as the renewable fuel standard is concerned, certain promises were made, certain government contracts were issued which extend all the way into the year 2022, and I believe that it's probably unfair to withdraw the rug because people have invested money. People have invested a lot of energy into that.But, you know, we are blessed with tremendous energy in this nation, and we need to be talking for new sources of energy. Seventy percent of our population lives by costly. What about hydroelectric power? We can develop that, you know? We have so much natural gas now, and we can liquify it, and we can transfer it across the sea so we can make Europe dependent on us instead of Putin &mdash; put him back in his little box where he belongs. Those are the kinds of things that we ought to be doing. And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments.And we can get a lot of them out if we get the government out of our lives. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, I don't know about the GOP messaging, but I can tell you about my messaging. You know, need to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies, because it's going to kill us if we don't. [applause]And in the Holy Land Foundation trial in 2006 in Texas, they had a memorandum, an explanatory memorandum that talked about the fact that Americans would be easy to overcome and to commit civilization jihad because they were going to be trying to protect the rights of the very people who were trying to subvert them.But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy. Teddy Roosevelt said, we are a nation of immigrants. As such, everybody is welcome from any race, any country, any religion, if they want to be Americans. If they want to accept our values and our laws. If not, they can stay where they are. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, I will gladly confess that I'm the only one on this stage with no political title. You're not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth. And I don't think you have to be a politician to tell the truth. In fact, sometimes it's not that way  [applause]   and I've had more two a.m. phone calls than everybody here put together, making life and death decisions, put together very complex teams to accomplish things that have never been done before. And we are in a situation right now in our country that we have never been in before. We need people who think out of the box and can solve problems; can utilize the resources around them; very smart people, to focus on the problem and solve the problem.The American people are terrified. That's why we have this abnormal situation going on right now. We don't need more of the same solutions. We need different solutions to solve the problems and to save our nation. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Bigger than that? Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can't think of anything better than that. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief.In a previous Democratic debate, Martha Raddatz, three times, asked Hillary Clinton about the failure in Libya, a policy that she took credit for, and said, "what is your measure of responsibility, Madam Secretary, for the failure in Libya?" Three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong. If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.Here's what I'd do. This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS. We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe.As president of the United States, that is exactly what I will do.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~How about one that I've done in New Jersey for the last six years. That's get rid of Planned Parenthood funding from the United States of America. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~I want to ask the people of the audience. Like, I'm standing here, I &mdash; I watched the video of Senator Cruz. I watched the video of Senator Rubio. I heard what they said. And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington. [applause]I feel like  [applause]   I feel like I need &mdash; I feel like I need a Washington to English dictionary converter, right? [laughter]I mean, I heard what they both said, I saw it on the video. And the fact is this is what makes a difference when you're a governor. You can change your mind. Ted can change his mind. Marco can change his mind. It's perfectly legal in this country to change your mind. But when you're a governor, you have to admit it. You can't hide behind parliamentary tricks. That's the difference, and that's the kind of leader we need in the White House. Stop the Washington bull and let's get things done. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Listen, I think that what people should do is use their common sense. And the fact is, let law enforcement make those decisions. I've told people that from the time I was U.S. attorney 13 years ago.It's not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal, or profiling or not. You see something that's suspicious, you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions.That's what should be done. That can be done. That can be done without profiling people. What that is, is just common sense. They thought something was wrong.And here's the problem in this country right now. The problem is that Barack Obama has made law enforcement the enemy, Hillary Clinton has made law enforcement the enemy.They're not supporting our law enforcement officers, it's making everybody nervous to get out of their cars, if you're a law enforcement officer. It's making  [bell rings]  everybody nervous to get out of their cars if you're a law enforcement officer. [bell rings]It's making people in neighborhoods nervous to go to law enforcement. As president, I will support law enforcement and we'll stop radical terrorist attacks in this country by supporting our intelligence community and law enforcement community. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Megyn?
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed. And that someone in that office has to do their job. So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn't violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky.I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it. But what I did say was that the person who came in for the license needed to get it. And so if there's someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that's what we should do.But just as importantly, and I agree with what John said. You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith. And here's the problem with what's going on around the world. The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us &mdash; every one of us. And the reason why this war against them is so important is that very basis of religious liberty.They want everyone in this country to follow their religious beliefs the way they do. They do not want us to exercise religious liberty. That's why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls. As a Catholic, that's what I want to do. And no matter what your faith is, that's what I want you to be able to do. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~On September 11, my wife was two blocks from the World Trade Center. When those buildings came down, she was trapped in her building and I didn't hear from her over six hours.We have three children, eight, five and one. And I had to confront the possibility of being a single parent. Terrorism in this country scares everyone. And the fact is that we need a commander-in- chief who not only understands how to protect us, but feels in here what it means to face the possibility of loss.I've faced it. I've prosecuted terrorists. I have made the decisions that need to be made as a governor to protect us and as president of the United States, no one will keep this country safer than I will.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing. And the fact is that what I did do, what I did do from the beginning, Chris, as soon as I found out about it, I fired the people who were responsible. And that's what you expect from a leader. And, I'll tell you something else. I inherited a state in New Jersey that was downtrodden, and beaten by liberal democratic policies, high taxation, high regulation. And, this year, in 2015, New Jersey's had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years. That's because we've put conservative policies in place.And, I'll tell you one other thing, you know why the Republican party will want to take a chance on me? Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they're going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September. And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am.I will be ready. I will take her on, and when I take her on I guarantee you one thing, she will never get within 10 miles of the White House. The days for the Clintons in public housing are over. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Talk about what? I
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~They're not wrong. But what's wrong is your premise in the question. You can do both. There is no reason why you can't stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government.You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn't work for them. You know, for the 45-year-old construction worker out there, who is having a hard time making things meet.He's lost $4,000 in the last seven years in his income because of this administration. He doesn't want to hear the talk about politics Megyn and who is establishment and who is grassroots. And who's compromised and who is principled. What he wants is something to get done.And that's the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions. Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable. I've been held accountable for six years as the governor of New Jersey and with a Democratic legislature, I've gotten conservative things done. That's exactly what I'll do as president of the United States. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~They knew they were talking about the issues of attacking people, Megyn. They knew that.[crosstalk]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, because you can do it without profiling, Megyn, when you do it on the facts. What those facts knew was that these folks had weapons. They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.That's not profiling, that's law enforcement. And that's the difference between somebody who knows how to do this and somebody who's never done it before.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, let me say that I do believe that the vote on NSA made the country less safe. Well, let me tell you what the country should really be worried about. I watched that town hall meeting with the Democrats the other night, and I heard Hillary Clinton asked a direct question by an Iowan, and that's what Iowans like to do. They like to ask direct questions.And, they asked about her email situation. And, here's what she said to the American people. She did it for convenience. For her convenience. She put America's secrets at risk for her convenience. She put American intelligence officers at risk for her convenience. She put American strategy at risk for her convenience.Let me tell you who's not qualified to be President of the United States, Chris. Hillary Rodham Clinton did that to our country. She is not qualified to be President of the United States. [cheering]The fact is what we need is someone on that stage who has been tested, who has been through it, who has made decisions, who has sit in the chair of consequence and can prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton on  [bell rings]   that stage, and that is exactly what I am ready to do. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Yes. You want one? [laughter]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Bret, we're just starting. The first vote hasn't been counted. Why don't we let the process work. I trust Iowans, Granite staters, people in South Carolina, people in Nevada, to start this process out. I kind of miss Donald Trump. He was a little teddy bear to me. [laughter]We always had such a loving relationship in these debates and in between and the tweets. I kind of miss him. I wish he was here. Everybody else was in the witness protection program when I went after him on behalf of what the Republican cause should be: conservative principles, believing in limited government, believing in accountability. Leading by fixing the things that are broken.Look, I am in the establishment because my dad, the greatest man alive was president of the United States and my brother, who I adore as well as fantastic brother was president. Fine, I'll take it. I guess I'm part of the establishment Barbara Bush is my mom. I'll take that, too. [applause]But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting. We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it. And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November. Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent. I released 34 years of tax returns  [bell rings]   and 300,000 e-mails in my government record. To get the information from Hillary Clinton, you need to get a subpoena from the FBI. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~But when you didn't do that and you ask people to support, you shouldn't cut and run.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Can I &mdash; can I &mdash; I just
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Chris, keep it coming
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Marco, Marco &mdash; he brought up my name. I have supported a consensus approach to solving this problem wherever it came up. and in 2007 it almost passed when my brother was president of the United States. A bipartisan approach got close. Barack Obama actually had the poison pill to stop it then.And when you led the charge with the Gang of Eight, I supported it because you asked me to. I think it's important for people in elected office to try to forge consensus to solve problems. There's never going do be perfect bill. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~No, they shouldn't. And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination. If I was a Puerto Rican, I'd vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship. They serve in the military. They would have to pay federal taxes. They would &mdash; they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship. But they should have the right of determine &mdash; self-determination.Before you get to that, though, Puerto Rico is going to have to deal with the structural problems they face. You know, it's &mdash; it's a fact that if you can pay for a $79 one-way ticket to Orlando, and you can escape the challenges of a declining economy and high crime rates, you move to Orlando.And a lot of people are doing that. And the spiraling out-of- control requires Puerto Rico to make structural reforms. The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not &mdash; the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won't be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they're facing right now.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~No, you weren't. Your name wasn't mentioned, Ted.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Of course. And there's all sorts of ways that can be done at the state, local and federal level to do that. But the first duty of the next president of the United States is to fix the mess at the Department of Veterans Affairs. That's his first responsibility. [applause]Look, we have waiting lists for veterans that are &mdash; that are leaving because of the sequester where we're gutting the military. More and more military personnel are leaving becoming veterans, and the waiting list grows. They've given out $140 million of bonuses to Veterans Department employees, including reducing the waiting lists, without giving veterans care. People died, and only three people have been fired.I will make sure that we fire the sheer incompetence inside the Department of Veterans Affairs and then we'll give veterans a choice card so that they don't have to travel hours and hours to get care if they want to go to their private provider. You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them &mdash; give veterans choices and you'll get a much better result. And as it relates to all the other organizations, let me give you a good example.In Houston, Texas, there's an organization in place because someone acted on their heart, wanted to make sure that there's no homeless veterans in Houston. And they've come pretty close to that without federal government assistance. We need to mobilize the entire country to treat our veterans and treat them with much more respect than they get today.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~So did you. [laughter]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Thank you Chris
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~That beautiful young woman who's an entrepreneur who served in the military, first of all, is deserving of our respect for service in the military and the fact that she's an entrepreneur. [applause]And we should be a welcoming nation. Our identity is not based on race or ethnicity, it's based on a set of shared values. That's American citizenship. And Dulce Candy &mdash; a pretty cool name, actually &mdash; that is now an entrepreneur over Youtube is part of that American spirit, and we should celebrate it as conservatives. That's what we believe in.You can &mdash; you can deal with the threat of terror and also recognize that this country should be aspirational across the board.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~We desperately need a conservative leader as president of the United States. I have a proven record as governor of the state of Florida, as a conservative leader. And I also have detailed plans to fix the mess in Washington, D.C.As president I will restore and rebuild our military, restore the alliances and keep us safe. And as our party's nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton in November. I ask for your support on the caucuses come Monday night and I will make you proud as our party's nominee. Thank you very much. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well first of all, I think it's important that when we're running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we're living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.Donald Trump, for example &mdash; I'm glad &mdash; I mentioned his name again just if anybody was missing him  [laughter]   Mr. Trump believed that in reaction to people's fears that we should ban all Muslims. Well, that creates an environment that's toxic in our own country. Nobela is a rising entrepreneur. She wants to pursue the American dream. She's an American citizen. She should not feel uncomfortable about her citizenship. She's not the threat. The threat is Islamic terrorism.We need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS. We need to deal with ISIS in the caliphate. We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there. You can't do that without the cooperation of the Muslim world because they're as threatened as we are.So, I think it's important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I've been critical of Donald Trump. Disparaging women, disparaging hispanics, that's not a sign of strength. Making fun of disabled people  [bell rings]   We're never going to win elections if we don't have a more broader unifying message. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, first of all, I've seen polls where I'm beating Hillary Clinton pretty regularly.And I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth. That's the record of accomplishment that should be taken to Hillary Clinton, who has no record of accomplishment. So I'm confident if I win this nomination, I will aggressively go against her and beat her.As it relates to the super PACs, I have no control over that. And this is beanbag compared to what the Clinton hit machine is going to do to the Republican nominee. The simple fact is, we all have a record. It all will be scrutinized. There's give and take. It's called the politics. And that's the way it is.I'm running hard and I believe I'll be the Republican nominee and I'll be the one best suited to beat Hillary Clinton, who should not be president of the United States. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, first, I was critical of the Senators not giving the authorization for the use of military force. They should have made it more open ended for the next president. We shouldn't have the war fighters have their arms tied behind their back as President Obama wanted to do, but they had a chance to show support and it wasn't popular at the time. It became popular after the attack in Paris, and San Bernardino. Now we hear the tough talk.Prior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan. Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS. And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we're going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country. The caliphate of ISIS has to be destroyed, which means we need to arm directly to Kurds, imbed our troops with the Iraqi military, re engage with the Sunni tribal leaders. Get the lawyers off the damn backs of the military once and for all. [cheering]Have a no fly zone in Syria and create safe zones to deal with the refugees. But, more importantly, to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support  [bell rings]   ground and air. That's what we need to to, and I laid that out prior to the crisis with the advice of a lot of people, including 12 Medal of Honor recipients that I'm proud that they're supporting my campaign. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, I'm kind of confused because he was the sponsor of the Gang of Eight bill that did require a bunch of thresholds but ultimately allowed for citizenship over an extended period of time. I mean, that's a fact. And he asked me to support that. And I &mdash; I supported him because I think people, when you're elected, you need to do things.And he led the charge to finally fix this immigration problem that has existed now for, as Marco says, for 30 years. And then he cut and run because it wasn't popular amongst conservatives, I guess.Here's what I believe. And I wrote a book about this called Immigration Wars. You can get it at $2.99 on Amazon. It's not a bestseller. I can promise you. [laughter]There won't be any &mdash; you can get it. It's affordable for everybody. We should have a path to legal status for the 12 million people that are here illegally. It means, come out from the shadows, pay a fine, earn legal status by working, by paying taxes, learning English. Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you're not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside. [applause] I think that is the &mdash; I think that's the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Yeah. So did you, Marco. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~You should stick with it and that's exactly what happened. He cut and run. And that's a tragedy because now  [bell rings]   it's harder and harder to actually solve this problem.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~But Bret, here's the problem. You take a look at the &mdash; at Belgium. I talked to a diplomat from Belgium. I said, "how's it going?" He said, "we have the military in the streets right now. We never dreamt we'd ever see it."See, I think there is an opportunity to bring the world together. The Turks are being threatened. We know about the French. We know about the Belgians. We know about the Brits. Everybody is under fire and under attack, and we have to stand together as an alliance.So actually, the opportunity is there, because of the threat to all of these countries, to bring all of us together  [bell rings]   and say there is something more important than money. It is the future of the world and the future of our children and grandchildren. That's the kind of leadership this country needs. It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.And that's only the beginning of the failures that they have committed, not only in the Middle East, but all over the world, including Russia and China.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~But I just have to tell you that it's best with some of these things not be said. Now I want to go back something. See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military. I was there in '89 when the wall came tumbling down because we were strong.And I was there when we went into the Gulf War. We didn't win that war just from the air, we won that war by assembling a group of Arab leaders who stood in the Rose Garden and stood with America. We want to destroy ISIS, it has to be in the air and on the ground. It has to be with our friends in the Arab world and our friends in Europe, the coalition that we had when we went to the first Gulf War.And then when we win that, and we will win that against ISIS as it settles down, and we should leave. Because we shouldn't be policemen of the world. But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~but wait a minute
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that there's an existential threat against all of them, the Arabs, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians, our friends in Europe, including the Turks. So we have a unique opportunity to bring everybody together.I saw Reagan do it, I've seen other presidents do it. And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience. At the same time we're doing all that, the Pentagon must be reformed so we get what we need for our men and women in uniform. All of that together, we're going to be just fine and America is going to continue to lead the world.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Chris  [applause]   there was a question about foreign policy, by the way, and experience. And I &mdash; I thought, if I didn't jump in, I might not be able to tell everybody this. I think they'd want to hear it.Look, I served on
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~I've always listened to you, Megyn. Go ahead.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~I know, Bret.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Look, we don't know what's going to happen in ten months. And if I were president of the United States right now, I'd be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are &mdash; violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it's not gonna be anywhere near as effective. But the president needs to be laying the groundwork right now for the ability to slap those sanctions back on worldwide.And I'll tell you what I'm worried about &mdash; I'm worried about money. You read about all the companies now that are doing business &mdash; about to do business in Iran, and if we don't get this settled now, with other countries in the world, about sanctions, then Iran could violate that agreement, and we're the only ones putting the sanctions on.We need to move aggressively now. But I would say this to you, Bret. Number one, if they violate it, we need to move against them. And number two, if we find out they're developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we're gonna go take it out. That is what we have to do. We cannot let things get farther down the road, like we did with North Korea.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~No. You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state. We took the growth of Medicaid from over 10 percent in my second budget to 2.5 percent, without cutting off one person or cutting one benefit, because we &mdash; we innovated the government.And now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home. And then we decided we could bring $14 billion of our money &mdash; I mean, Washington doesn't have any money. It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill. Because I don't think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they're not in an in-and-out-of-the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don't live in emergency rooms.How has it worked? Well, we have treated the drug-addicted in our prisons and we released them in to the community, and our recidivism rate is less than 20 percent. That's basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director. The mentally ill? They've been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them.In terms of my faith, look, all I say is that when I study scripture, I know that people who live in the shadows need to have a chance. But I'm not deciding that anybody's got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do. But what &mdash; I will tell you this. The time has come to stop ignoring the mentally ill in this country and begin to treat them and get them on their feet, along with, of course, with treating the drug-addicted. [applause]Because we don't want them in and out &mdash; we don't want them in and out of the prisons. Give people a chance. We talked about criminal justice reform. We've enacted it in our state. Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America. Everybody ought to have a chance to be able to rise to their God-given purpose.And that is what we have done in Ohio. We're running surpluses. We're up 400,000 jobs. And guess what? The formula is working. I'd suggest people take a look at it.Thank you. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~OK.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~That's right. Yes.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~the only reason is &mdash; look
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, first of all, I had a national reporter say, you know, there's three lanes. There's the establishment lane, the anti-establishment lane, and then there's the Kasich lane.And the reason is, is that I've been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor. You know, the situation is this. We cannot fix things in this country &mdash; the Social Security, the border, balancing the budget, getting wages to grow faster &mdash; unless we lead as conservatives, but we also invite people in from the other party. We have to come together as a country. And we have to stop all the divisions.And, you know, that's been my message in New Hampshire. And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.And it isn't because I'm all that great. It's because I've been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something that's a little bigger than themselves. I'll keep &mdash; I'll keep heading in that direction, believe me. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools. And those are made up of the FBI, state and local law enforcement. And Megyn, it's best not to talk anymore about back doors and encryption, it will get solved, but it needs to be solved in the situation of the White House with the technology folks.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, you've got to be on top of it right away. And, you know, I don't know all the details of what Rick Snyder has done. I know there have been people who have been fired; people who are being held accountable. But the fact is, every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that.And I've had many situations in the state of Ohio where we've had to move, whether it's storms, whether it was a horrible school shooting. There are many crises that come &mdash; a water crisis in Toledo. You've got to be on top of it. You've got to go the extra mile. You've got to work with local communities and you've got to work with the federal government.Because you realize that people depending on you. And so, you go the extra mile. But people have to be alert. They have to be alert to problems. And when you see a problem, you must act quickly to get on top of it. And people at home are saying they've got a problem, listen to them. Because most of the time, they're absolutely correct.So the fact is that we work for the people. The people don't work for us. And we have to have an attitude when we're in government of serving-hood. That's what really matters. We serve you. You don't serve us. We listen to you and &mdash; and then we act. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Yes &mdash; thank you.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~You know, one of our biggest national security issues is the world looks at us some time, and we look at each other and say, why can't we solve problems? Well, I've got news for you, we can. We can in fact create jobs and provide job security. We can create a situation where wages begin to rise. We can create a situation for our children to be able to get a decent job to pay down their college debt. We can re-assume our role in the world.But all of this has to come together when we have a positive attitude, an optimistic approach, an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives, to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra. You see, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, I'm an optimist [bell rings]Because I've seen so many things get accomplished in my lifetime. And we can do it again together, all of us, to strengthen this country, work together. Thank you. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~And I think that's the false choice  [applause]   that's the &mdash; that's the false choice in this whole debate about immigration. Of course, we're going to be a nation of immigrants. By the way, no nation on earth is more generous than America is. Every single year close to a million people emigrate to the United States legally. There's no nation on earth that comes close to that number.I think the only argument is are we a sovereign country, are we not allowed to choose who comes in, when they come in and how they come in? And that's not what's happening now. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~And second of all  [applause]   and I think &mdash; you know, Governor &mdash; Jeb, you &mdash; the attack that &mdash; the authorization that Barack Obama asked for was not against ISIS. It was against Assad. And John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small.I don't think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity. So it was not against ISIS, it was against &mdash; it was against Assad.I think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict  [bell rings]  and that do not allow us to pursue victory. When I'm president, that will change.[crosstalk]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~But Megyn
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Chris, let's begin by being clear what this campaign is about. It's not about Donald Trump. He's an entertaining guy. He's the greatest show on earth. This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special.You see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America. Barack Obama wants to change America. Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world. We don't want to be like the rest of the world. We want to be the United States of America. [applause]That is why Hillary Clinton cannot win this election. Hillary Clinton this week said Barack Obama would make a great Supreme Court justice. The guy who systematically and habitually violates the constitution on the Supreme Court? I don't think so. If I'm our nominee, I will unite this party and we'll defeat Hillary Clinton and we will turn this country around once and for all, after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~do I go &mdash; let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after. But  [laughter]   first of all
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~First of all &mdash; Let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after. [laughter] First of all
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~First of all, earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty. It's what they call it. And, the reality of it is this, it is unfair to the people that have legally entered this country to create an alternative for individuals who entered illegally, and knowingly did so.[end video clip][begin video clip]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~first of all, I'm &mdash; don't worry, I'm not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~I do not support amnesty
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~I think the other problem is we have a legal immigration system that's outdated, it's primarily based on whether you have family members living here. In the 21st century, it has to be more of a merit-based system, and that is why our legal immigration system is in need of modernization. And we will always celebrate legal immigration like Dulce's great story.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand. He believes everything he stands for. [applause]I do respect Rand.But I want to be frank about what I stand for. I believe the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest power in the world. And I believe only with a strong America will we defeat this radical group, this apocalyptic group called ISIS.That's why when I'm president we are going to rebuild our intelligence capabilities. And they're going to tell us where the terrorists are. And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.And if we capture any of these ISIS killers alive, they are going to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we're going to find out everything they know, because when I'm president, unlike Barack Obama, we will keep this country safe. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~It's interesting that Jeb mentions the book. That's the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~It absolutely has been, and at the time in the context of that was in 2009, and 2010, where the last effort for legalization was an effort done in the Senate. It was an effort led by several people that provided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.What I've always said is that this issue does need to be solved. They've been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens. And, I'm going to tell you exactly how we're going to deal with it when I am president.Number one, we're going to keep ISIS out of America. If we don't know who you are, or why you're coming, you will not get into the United States.Number two, we're going to enforce our immigration laws. I am the son and grandson of immigrants. And I know that securing our borders is not anti-immigrant and we will do it.We'll hire 20,000 new border agents instead of 20,000 new IRS agents. We will finish the 700 miles of fencing and walls our nation needs. We'll have mandatory E-verify, a mandatory entry/exit tracking system and until all of that is in place and all of that is working and we can prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control, nothing else is going to happen.We are not going to round up and deport 12 million people, but we're not going to hand out citizenship cards, either. There will be a process. We will see what the American people are willing to support. But it will not be unconstitutional executive orders like the ones Barack Obama has forced on us.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~It was
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~May I respond?
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Megyn, that's the problem. Radical Muslims and radical Islam is not just hate talk. It's hate action. They blow people up. Look what they did in San Bernardino.Look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia, that the White House still refuses to link to terror, where a guy basically shot a police officer three times.He told the police, "I did it because I was inspired by ISIS," and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror.Look, the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented. There has never been a jihadist group like this. They have affiliates in over a dozen countries now.They are the best funded radical jihadist group in the history of the world, and they have shown a sophisticated understanding of the laws of other countries on how to insert fighters into places, and they are actively plotting to attack us here at home and around the world.We must keep America safe from this threat. And yes, when I am president of the United States, if there is some place in this country where radical jihadists are planning to attack the United States, we will go after them wherever they are, and if we capture them alive, they are going to Guantanamo. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Might I respond? [applause]The first thing &mdash; I don't know of anyone who's not in favor of fully vetting people that are trying to come into this country, other than perhaps Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. I think we all support that. Rand's amendment was not the right way to do it.I do believe that people who are trying to come to the United States &mdash; this country has a right to know who they are and why they are coming. And that's why I've been clear, when I am the president of the United States of America, we don't know who you are, and we don't know why you're trying to come to the United States, you are not going to get in, because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented  [bell rings]   and when I'm president, we are keeping ISIS out of America.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Never support. Never have and never will support any effort to grant blanket legalization amnesty to folks who have entered, or stayed in this country illegally.[end video clip][begin video clip]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~No, because if you look at the quote, and it's very specific. And, it says blanket amnesty, I do not support blanket amnesty
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~No, I said I do not support blanket amnesty
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~no, I understand, but let me respond. I was mentioned on this &mdash; in this answer, and so I'm going to respond this way.This is the lie that Ted's campaign is built on, and Rand touched upon it &mdash; that he's the most conservative guy, and everyone else is a &mdash; you know, everyone else is a rhino.The truth is, Ted, throughout this campaign, you've been willing to say or do anything in order to get votes. Ted, you worked for George W. Bush's campaign  [booing]You &mdash; you &mdash; you helped design George W. Bush's &mdash; you helped design George W. Bush's immigration policy. And then, when you got to the Senate, you did an interview with CBS News &mdash; I wasn't even part of the video &mdash; where you said, on the issue of people that are here illegally, "we can reach a compromise."And then in the committee, you said, "I want to bring people out of the shadows." [bell rings]Now you want to trump Trump on immigration. But you can't &mdash; we're not gonna beat Hillary Clinton with someone who's willing to say or do anything to win an election.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~The bible commands us to let our light shine on the world. For over 200 years, America's light has been shining on the world and the world has never been the same again. But now, that light is dimming a little, after seven years of Barack Obama. And that's why Monday night, what will happen here in Iowa is so important.I'm asking you for your vote. Caucus for me on Monday night because if I am your nominee, I will unite this party and I will defeat Hillary Clinton and when I'm president, America's light will shine again and the 21 century will be a new American century. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~There's not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws. That is abundantly clear. You're not going to be able to ram down the throat of the American people your approach. The only way we're are going to be able to move forward after two migratory crises with minor, after two unconstitutional executive orders, the only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control. And until that happens there's not going to be consensus on this issue.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, again, I mean, obviously, as already has been pointed out, the only budget that Ted has ever voted for is a budget that Rand Paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending. And I think that's a bad idea for the following reason.ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind. ISIS is now found in affiliates in over a dozen countries. ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides. ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq &mdash; not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said &mdash; mis-said that wrong once [inaudible] time &mdash; the city of Dabiq in Syria. They want to trigger an apocalyptic Armageddon showdown. This group needs to be confronted and defeated. They are not going to go away on their own. They're not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes. They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.Today, we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II, the smallest Navy in 100 years, the smallest Air Force in our history. You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that's being diminished. When I'm president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military because the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military in the world.[crosstalk]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, Bret, first that's not entirely the story. At the time, the liberal governor of Florida, who claimed he was a Republican &mdash; his name was Charlie Crist &mdash; he wanted to impose cap-and-trade on Florida. And I opposed it. I was the first person out of the box that opposed him on it.And then we saw that the leading candidates for president at the time, both the Republican and the Democrats, all supported it. And what we said is, if they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it. But I have never supported cap- and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea. And I was clear about that at the time.And I do not believe it's a good idea now. I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment. And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy.When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, but you changed the &mdash; in the book
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton. Hillary doesn't want to run against me, but I cannot wait to run against her. And I cannot wait to earn the opportunity to do it because she cannot be the president of the United States.She wants to put Barack Obama on the Supreme Court of the United States of America. She said that here in Iowa just two days ago. That would be a disaster for this country.So I hope and pray and cannot wait until this state and others give me an opportunity to serve this party as its nominee because I will defeat Hillary Clinton. [cheering and applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, let me be clear about one thing, there's only one savior and it's not me. It's Jesus Christ who came down to earth and died for our sins. [applause]And so &mdash; and I've always made that clear about that cover story.As far as the polls are concerned, Iowa, on Monday night you're going to go to a caucus site and you'll be the first Americans that vote in this election. You will be the first Americans that get to answer the fundamental question, what comes next for this country after seven disastrous years of Barack Obama?And let me tell you what the answer better not be. It better not be Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders is a socialist. I think Bernie Sanders is good candidate for president of Sweden. [laughter]We don't want to be Sweden. We want to be the United States of America. [applause]And Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being the commander-in-chief of the United States. In fact, one of her first acts as president may very well be to pardon herself because Hillary Clinton  [laughter]Hillary Clinton stored classified information on her private server. And Hillary Clinton lied to the families of those four brave Americans who lost their life in Benghazi. And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, let me first describe Iran because they're not just a normal nation state. And we have no quarrel with the Iranian people. But the Iranian leader, their supreme leader is a radical Shia cleric who has an apocalyptic vision of the future. He views himself not simply as the leader of Iran, but as the leader of all Muslims &mdash; all Shia Muslims on the planet. And they have a desire not simply to conquer the Middle East and to become the dominant power in that region, but ultimately to be able to hold America hostage.That is why they're building an &mdash; right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there's going &mdash; they're going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.We will &mdash; when I am president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are canceling the deal with Iran, and nations will have to make a choice. They can do business with Iran, or they can do business with America, and I am very confident they're going to choose America before they choose the Iranian economy.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Yeah, but let me respond
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Yeah, I would encourage people to go on my website, marcorubio.com, and we'll put all the facts up there so people can see it for themselves. But you've just asked a very fundamental question about the role of faith in our country. And I think this is an important question. I think if you do not understand that our Judeo-Christian values are one of the reasons why America is such a special country, you don't understand our history. You see, why are we one of the most generous people in the world &mdash; no, the most generous people in the world? Why do Americans contribute millions of dollars to charity?It is not because of the tax writeoff. It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor. This is what's made our nation so special.And you should hope that our next president is someone that is influence by their faith. Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures. And when I'm president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I'll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.Because in the end, my goal is not simply to live on this earth for 80 years, but to live an eternity with my creator. And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~You cannot grant amnesty. If the American people see us granting amnesty they will never again believe in legal immigration. They will never again support it, and that's wrong for our country, bad for our future.[end video clip]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~You wrote a book where you changed your position from a path of citizenship to a path of legalization. And the bottom line is this, we are not going to be able to do anything on this issue until we first bring illegal immigration under control. The American people have been told for 30 years they're going to enforce the border, they're going to build a wall and it never gets built and it never happens.It is very clear there will be no progress on this issue in any way, shape or form, until you prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control. And when I'm president, we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~[inaudible].
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~and I'd like to respond.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Both. No, both the federal and a state approach. I have said that we could leave it to the states but I've also introduced a federal solution as well. So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.But I've also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states. So there might be an occasion if we did overturn Roe v. Wade &mdash; Roe v. Wade nationalized the issue. If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again.I think it would be better the more &mdash; the less abortions we have, so the more states that we have that made abortion illegal, the better, as far as trying to save and preserve lives.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~I was there and I saw the debate. I saw Ted Cruz say, "we'll take citizenship off the table, and then the bill will pass, and I'm for the bill."The bill would involve legalization. He can't have it both ways. But what is particularly insulting, though, is that he is the king of saying, "you're for amnesty." Everybody's for amnesty except for Ted Cruz.But it's a falseness, and that's an authenticity problem &mdash; that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because we're all for amnesty. I was for legalization. I think, frankly, if you have border security, you can have legalization. So was Ted, but now he says it wasn't so. That's not true.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Just very quickly, I would like to respond.The bulk collection of your phone data, the invasion of your privacy did not stop one terrorist attack. I don't think you have to give up your liberty for a false sense of security.When we look at this bulk collection, the court has looked at this. Even the court declared it to be illegal. If we want to collect the records of terrorists, let's do it the old fashioned way. Let's use the Fourth Amendment. Let's put a name on a warrant, let's ask a judge for it. Let's respect the history of our country.John Adams said that we fought a War for Independence because we wanted to fight against generalized warrants. Let's don't forget that. [applause]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~May I respond?[crosstalk]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~My budget was mentioned. My budget was mentioned.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Senator Cruz, I'd like to respond
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Thank you, Marco.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Thank you.The issue in Syria's a very important one, and it's one we need to get right. The question is, should we be bombing both sides of the war? Some want to topple Assad. In fact, they want to bomb ISIS and Assad simultaneously.I think that's a really, really bad idea. In fact, I've said for several years that arming the allies of ISIS will make the situation worse, That what we really need to do is defeat ISIS.But if you defeat Assad, what you will wind up with is a larger and more powerful ISIS that occupies that space. You might &mdash; you may well see an ISIS that takes over all of Syria. [bell rings]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, I mean, I was talked about in the question.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, thanks for having me. It's great to be back. [applause]I'm an eye surgeon from Bowling Green, Kentucky, I miss doing eye surgery, still get to do a little bit. Did a couple of cataract surgeries over Christmas holidays. Got to go to Haiti last year. I've gotten to do some incredible things. Got to be on the floor of the Senate. And it has been amazing to me.But the thing that is most important to me and caused me to run for office is I'm worried about the country and how much debt we're adding. And I am the one true fiscal conservative who will look at all spending. And that's the only way we'll ever balance our budget.Thank you. [applause]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Yeah, no, I think that's a &mdash; that's a huge mistake, to be closing down mosques. But I would say that if you want to defend the country, it begins with border security. And this is where I've had my disagreement with Senator Rubio.When he brought forward the "Gang of Eight" bill to give citizenship to those who came here illegally, I put forward an amendment that says we should have more scrutiny on those who are coming as students, those who are coming as immigrants, those who are coming as refugees, because we had two refugees come to my town in Bowling Green and try to attack us.Marco opposed this because they made a deal. He made a deal with Chuck Schumer that he would oppose any conservative amendments. And I think that's a mistake, and I just don't think Marco can have it both ways. You can't be in favor of defend us  [bell rings]   against Islam &mdash; radical Islam &mdash; if you're not for border security.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Yeah. But I combine this also with the millions upon millions of dollars they've taken from regimes in the Middle East who treat women like cattle. [applause]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~You know, I've always had a great deal of respect. There's probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father. I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that we've ever seen in a generation.And so in no way have I ever said that I don't embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country. I think what's interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don't think they're necessarily going to go for Ted.You know, Ted didn't show up. We had an audit-the-Fed vote, which was the biggest thing my dad had been advocating for, for 30 years, Ted didn't have time to show up. He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.And so I think really that vote is going to stay in the Paul household. I think more of it is coming and it's going to grow.The NSA is another big issue. Ted said he was for NSA reform, but then he told Marco Rubio, no, no, no, I voted for the bill because I'm for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records.I don't think Ted can have it both ways. They want to say they're getting some of the liberty vote. But we don't see it happening at all. We think we're going to do very well in Iowa with the liberty vote. [applause]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~You know, I've never really brought this up unless asked the question, but I have responded to the question. I don't blame Hillary Clinton at all for this. I don't think she's responsible for his behavior. But I do think that her position as promoting women's rights and fairness to women in the workplace, that if what Bill Clinton did any CEO in our country did with an intern, with a 22-year- old, 21-year-old intern in their office, they would be fired. They would never be hired again. [applause]Fired, never hired again and probably shunned in their community. And the thing is, she can't be a champion of women's rights at the same time she's got this that is always lurking out there, this type of behavior. So it is difficult.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~You know, I've supported legislation to allow body cameras. I've been to Ferguson, I've been trying to look for solutions to our criminal justice problem.One thing I discovered in Ferguson was that a third of the budget for the city of Ferguson was being reaped by civil fines. People were just being fined to death. Now you and I and many of the people in this audience, if we get a $100 fine, we can survive it. If you're living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job.I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don't unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.In Ferguson, for every 100 African-American women, there are only 60 African-American men. Drug use is about equal between white and black, but our prisons &mdash; three out of four people in prison are black or brown. I think something has to change. I think it's a big thing that our party needs to be part of, and I've been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform. [applause]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~You know, I think abortion is always wrong. I've supported a variety of solutions, both state as well as federal. In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb.But I think on the broader question of religion and politics, you know, I think liberty, itself requires a virtue &mdash; requires a virtuous people. In fact, Washington said that democracy requires a virtuous people.Oz Guinness, the theologian, said that liberty requires restraint but the only restraint consistent with liberty is self-restraint. There's a lot packed into that statement. But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation. The government is not always going to save us and it's not always going to come from government.But if we don't know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way. I think we become unmoored and I think without the religious foundation that guides us all, I think we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~[inaudible] opening statement.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Actually, I was
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~and to devote the resources from the booming economy to rebuilding our Navy, rebuilding our Air Force, rebuilding our Army and ensuring we have the capacity to keep this country safe.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~and we will end the illegal immigration.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~But &mdash; but Megyn, the bill was 1,000 pages. I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill. The fact that each amendment didn't fix every problem didn't mean that I supported the rest of the bill.And I'll tell you who supported my amendment &mdash; Jeff Sessions, the strongest opponent of amnesty in the United States Congress. And he did so because taking citizenship off the table was important, and it revealed the hypocrisy of the proponents of this bill, who were looking for votes.Listen, we can solve immigration. We just heard an argument back and forth that we can't solve immigration. I have a detailed immigration plan that is on my website, tedcruz.org. It was designed with Iowa's own Congressman Steve King and Jeff Sessions, and  [applause]   we have the tools in federal law to do this now. We can build the fence. We can triple the border patrol. We can end sanctuary cities by cutting off  [bell rings]   funding to them. We can end welfare for those here illegally. And what is missing is the political will, because too many Democrats and, sadly, too many Republicans don't want to solve this problem. If I am elected president  [bell rings]   we will secure the border
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Chris, I would note that that the last four questions have been, "Rand, please attack Ted. Marco, please attack Ted. Chris, please attack Ted. Jeb, please attack Ted " [audience reaction]Let me just say this
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama. Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system. It brought booming economic growth and that growth fueled rebuilding the military. I intend to do the exact same thing to defeat radical Islamic terrorism &mdash;
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Chris, your questions that you
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Chris? Chris I was mentioned in that question.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~I want this bill to be voted down. I don't want immigration reform to fail. I want immigration reform to pass. I believe if this amendment were to pass, the chances of this bill passing into law would increase dramatically.I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass. And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem.If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground. That would fix the problem, and also allow, for those 11 million people who are here illegally, a legal status, with citizenship off the table.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Ninety-three hours. The media noise will soon be over and it's now for the men and women of Iowa to decide. Our country is in crisis. We're worried the future of our children and we've have been burned over and over again.The central question in this race is trust. Who do you know will kill the terrorists, defend the constitution and repeal Obamacare? Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders? Who do you know will defend life, marriage and religious liberty? Examine our records, pray on it and I will be honored if you and your family will come caucus for us on Monday night. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Sure. Well, let's take it one at a time. First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster. It is the biggest job-killer in this country. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.If I'm elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare. [applause]Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need healthcare reform. It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors.Three specific reforms that reflect those principles. Number one, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines. That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost, catastrophic health insurance.Number two, we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax-advantaged way for more routine healthcare needs. And number three, we should work to de-link health insurance from employment so if you lose your job, your health insurance goes with you and it is personal, portable and affordable.And I'll tell you, Bret, I think that's a much more attractive vision for healthcare than the Washington-drive, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions of people to hurt. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~This entire question was an attack, but that's [inaudible]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, Chris, I'm glad to discuss my views on ethanol and energy. I think God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources, and we should pursue all of the above. We should be developing oil, and gas, and coal, and nuclear, and wind, and solar, and ethanol, and biofuels. But, I don't believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers. And, I think there should be no mandates, and no subsidies whatsoever. [applause]And, indeed, my tax plan that I've introduced, it's available on our website. It's a simple flat tax for everyone. It'll produce enormous economic growth, and it eliminates every mandate, every subsidy, so there's no subsidies for oil and gas, no subsidies for anyone.Now, it is true that there are a bunch of lobbyists, and a bunch of Democrats in this state spending millions of dollars trying to convince the people of Iowa that I somehow oppose ethanol. It's not true. I have introduced legislation that would phase out the ethanol mandate over five years, but that is in the context of having no mandates whatsoever for anyone.And, I would not that there's a much more important government regulation to ethanol, and that's the EPA's blend wall that makes it illegal to sell mid-level blends of ethanol in gasoline. I will  [bell rings]   Tear down the EPA's blend wall which will enable ethanol to expand its market share by up to 60%, all without mandates. All without any government mandates whatsoever through the marketplace. And, I'll note finally, Chris, there is a reason that Iowa's Congressman Steve King, perhaps the fiercest defender of farmers in this state, is sharing my campaign. Because he understands that I'm committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, Chris, I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism, go after ISIS, hunt them down wherever they are, and utterly and completely destroy ISIS. [applause]You know, you claim it is tough talk to discuss carpet bombing. It is not tough talk. It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we've seen from Barack Obama. Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military. You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war. When that war began, we had 8,000 planes. Today, we have about 4,000. When that war began, we had 529 ships. Today, we have 272.You want to know what carpet bombing is? It's what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy. Right now, Barack Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day. He's not arming the Kurds. We need to define the enemy. We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy. And we need to be focused and lift the rules of engagement so we're not sending our fighting men and women into combat with their arms tied behind their backs. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, Chris, you are exactly right that I am not the candidate of career politicians in Washington. [applause]And I'll tell you the endorsements that I am proud of are the over 200,000 volunteers across this country who have signed up to volunteer for our campaign. The endorsements that I am proud of are leading conservatives like Iowa's own Congressman Steve King, who is a national co-chairman of my campaign. The endorsements that I'm proud of are conservative leaders like Dr. James Dobson, and over 700,000 contributions nationwide, people going to our Web site, tedcruz.org.This is a grassroots campaign and, you know, when I ran for senate in Texas, I told the people of Texas that I'm not going there to go along to get along. Washington is broken.And the people I have been accountable to every single day in the Senate are the 27 million Texans who I represent and I made a promise to them that I make to you today, which is, if I am elected, every single day I will do two things: tell the truth, and do what I said I would do. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition. You've got to be able to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians, and stitch together a winning majority.When it comes to the audit the Fed bill, as Rand knows well, I was an original sponsor of the bill, I'm strongly supportive of it. It didn't have the votes to pass. And I had commitments to be at a town hall in New Hampshire.But I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, let me be clear, if Donald engages in insults or anybody else, I don't intend to reciprocate. I have not insulted Donald personally and I don't intend to.I am glad Donald is running. I'm glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm, and, every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support. I know everyone else on this stage hopes to earn your support.Now, there is a difference between personal insults and attacks &mdash; between going into the mud with ad hominems and focusing on issues and substance.  CRUZ:  I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics. That's fair game but that's where I'm going to focus. That's how I focused from the beginning of the campaign and it is how I intend to continue going forward. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, Megyn, let me say at the outset to the men and women of Iowa, thank you for the incredible hospitality over this past year.By Monday, you will have welcomed me into all 99 counties in Iowa. You will have welcomed my dad to preach at your churches. You will have welcomed Heidi and our girls, Caroline and Catherine, into your homes. And I'm so grateful for the diligence, for the seriousness with which the men and women of Iowa approach this process.If I am elected president, keep an eye on the tarmac, because I'll be back, because Iowa in 2017 will not be fly-over country. It will be fly-to country. [applause]Now, secondly, let me say I'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly. And Ben, you're a terrible surgeon. [laughter] Now that we've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way  [laughter and applause]I want to thank everyone here for showing the men and women of Iowa the respect to show up and make the case to the people of this state and the people of the country why each of us believe we would make the best commander in chief. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Well, no, no. A debate actually is a policy issue, but I will say this. Gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage. [applause]Chris, the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is who's best prepared to be Commander in Chief. Who has the experience, who has the knowledge, who has the judgement, who has the clarity, and vision and strength of resolve to keep this country safe. That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let's stay focused on those issues &mdash; rather than just attacks directed at each other.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~What was your question
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~You know, I like Marco. He's very charming. He's very smooth. But the facts are simple. When he ran for election in the state of Florida, he told the people of Florida, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."When I ran in Texas, I told the people of Texas, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty." We both made the identical promises. But when we came to Washington, we made a different choice.Marco made the choice to go the direction of the major donors &mdash; to support amnesty because he thought it was politically advantageous. [bell rings]I honored my commitments, and as president, I will honor every commitment that I make to the men and women of this country. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~You know, John Adams famously said, "facts are are stubborn things." The facts are are very, very simple. When that battle was waged, my friend Senator Rubio chose to stand with Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and support amnesty.And I stood alongside Jeff Sessions and Steve King, and we led the fight against amnesty. And if you want to know who's telling the truth, you should look and ask people like Jeff Sessions and Steve King and Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, all of whom say, as Jeff Sessions said, responding to these false attacks just recently in Alabama &mdash; he said, "if it wasn't for Ted Cruz, the Gang of Eight Rubio/Schumer bill would have passed. But because Ted stood up and helped lead the effort, millions rose up to kill it. [bell rings] [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~You know, the amendment you're talking about is one sentence &mdash; it's 38 words. Anyone can go online at tedcruz.org and read exactly what it said. In those 38 words, it said anyone here illegally is permanently ineligible for citizenship. It didn't say a word about legalization. I introduced
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Des Moines, Iowa~January 28, 2016~Your question was you have disagreed  [audience reaction]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~[inaudible]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~about my record.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~According to your poll [crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Actually, it was for business. It was. It was. It was for business. I pride myself, including outside of the United States. I'm doing almost 120 deals outside of the &mdash; which I hope to be able to stop very soon and let my children handle it &mdash; but we're doing many, many deals outside of the United States.I support politicians. In 2008, I supported Hillary Clinton. I supported many other people, by the way. And that was because of the fact that I'm in business. I did support very heavily Ronald Reagan. I also supported George Bush, by the way.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~again, there will be a lot of advertising. It's the only thing that might save him. But I doubt it.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~And &mdash; and &mdash; and &mdash; I'm a leader. I'm a leader. I've always been a leader. I've never had any problem leading people. If I say do it, they're going to do it. That's what leadership is all about.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~And I will tell you this. First of all, I got a call from my sister and brother tonight, and they said we had no idea Dad gave you $200 million. Believe me, I started off with $1 million. I built a company that's worth more than $10 billion. And I say it not in a bragging way, but that's the kind of thinking we need.Very low debt, tremendous cash flow. My financials are all &mdash; they're all in there with the federal elections. You've seen them. Everybody has seen them. I say it only because that's the kind of thinking this country needs with $19 trillion in debit. Believe me. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~And that's a huge &mdash; of course it is. We are going to buy things for less money. Of course it is. That works out
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~And they're killing &mdash; they're going to [crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~And we will.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~And, by the way, just so you understand [applause] this is a case I could have settled very easily, but I don't settle cases very easily when I'm right. Ninety-eight percent approval rating, we have an "A" from the Better Business Bureau
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~And, I'm at 49, so when he says 75 percent, that would mean that 80 percent of the people don't dig you, and I'm back down to 50
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Before they had the information
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Before they had the information it got &mdash; it is right now an "A", once they had the information
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~But it was elevated to an "A"
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~But let's see what happens at the end of three years. Let's see who's right.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~By taking the course.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~By the way, that's the other thing
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~CNN spent a lot of money on a poll, just came out. I'm at 49. He's at 15. He tells me about 65 percent of the people. It's not 65 percent of the people. If you go by that, 85 percent of the people.Then he goes, we have five. And &mdash; well, excuse me, I won 10. I won 10 states. If you listen to him, it's like &mdash; I won 10 states. Everybody knows that on Super Tuesday Trump was the winner. There wasn't one person that didn't say that. Even the two people on your left and right said we did a great job. So how does he take &mdash; how does he take five and say it's better than 10?
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Correct.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Department of Education. We're cutting Common Core. We're getting rid of Common Core. We're bringing education locally. Department of Environmental Protection. We are going to get rid are of it in almost every form. We're going to have little tidbits left but we're going to take a tremendous amount out.We have various other things. If you look at the IRS, if you look at every single agency, we can cut it down, and I mean really cut it down and save. The waste, fraud, and abuse is massive.Larry Kudlow, great guy, everybody respects him, said my plan for taxes and tax cutting is the best by far of everybody.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Don't worry about it, little Marco.[crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Even if it's not me? [laughter]Let me just start off by saying
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Excuse me, the lead plaintiff signed a letter saying how great it was, and it on tape saying how great it was.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Fine.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~First of all I've had tens of thousands of people working for me, most of which are &mdash; 98, 97, 98 percent of the people in this country, from this country. I'm very proud of it. You have a club in Palm Beach, Florida called the Mar-a-Lago Club, it's a very, very successful club. It has a very short season, it's called, the Season, and it goes from November until March.It's a few months, five months at the most. People don't want a short-term job. They don't want &mdash; so, we will bring people in, and we will send the people out. All done legally, all done with the process that's [bell ringing] approved by government in Palm Beach, or West Palm Beach. We bring people in, we bring them out. We want to hire as many Americans as we can, but they don't want part-time, very short part-time jobs.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Give me a break.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~He didn't answer &mdash; he's not a leader. And, frankly, when I say they'll do as I tell them, they'll do as I tell them. And that's very &mdash; it's very simple. It's very simple.We are in a very dangerous place. We have a depleted military. Totally depleted. We have &mdash; by the way, our vets are treated horribly. We're going to take care of our vets. We're going to start taking care of our vets, properly, like we should. [applause]But we're going to build up our military, and we're going to get the equipment we want, not the equipment that's sold to us by somebody that gave him and him and not the governor campaign contributions. OK? We're going to get the equipment that the generals and the soldiers want.I will prove to be a great leader. And, you know, it's very interesting, we talk about the polls. Every single poll when it comes to ISIS and the military and the border say, by far, Trump is the best.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~He doesn't show up to vote.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~He has lied so much about my record.

Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Hello.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I'm changing it, and I'm softening the position because we have to have talented people in this country.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I'm changing. I'm changing. We need highly skilled people in this country, and if we can't do it, we'll get them in. But, and we do need in Silicon Valley, we absolutely have to have.So, we do need highly skilled, and one of the biggest problems we have is people go to the best colleges. They'll go to Harvard, they'll go to Stanford, they'll go to Wharton, as soon as they're finished they'll get shoved out. They want to stay in this country. They want to stay here desperately, they're not able to stay here. For that purpose, we absolutely have to be able to keep the brain power in this country. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I'm not only talking about drugs, I'm talking about other things. We will save $300 billion a year if we properly negotiate. We don't do that. We don't negotiate. We don't negotiate anything.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I'm not playing to anybody's fantasies, I'm playing to the fact that our country is in trouble, that we have a tremendous problem with crime. The border is a disaster, it's like a piece of Swiss cheese. We're going to stop it, we're going to stop people from coming into our country illegally. We're going to stop it. [applause] [cheering]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I'm saying saving through negotiation throughout the economy, you will save $300 billion a year.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I &mdash; I did not say that. I did not say that.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I am by far the leader. But if you listen to a politician, he'll try and convince you otherwise.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I beat Hillary Clinton
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I beat Hillary Clinton in many polls
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I beat Hillary Clinton in many polls. The Cue poll just came out. I beat Hillary Clinton in a recent Fox poll, I beat Hillary Clinton in USA Today, I beat her today in a poll in Ohio. I beat &mdash; I'm the only one that beats Hillary Clinton.I beat &mdash; and I have not started on Hillary yet. Believe me, I will [cheering]  start soon. I haven't even started.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I beat Hillary Clinton. I beat Hillary Clinton in many polls
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I can give it to you. I can give it to you tomorrow..
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I did not say that.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I don't believe these politicians. All talk, no action. I'm standing here listening to &mdash; I'm hearing him say about a percentage. CNN, he gets 15. That means 85 percent, based on what you're saying, of the people don't dig you, number one, number one. Is that a correct statement? How do you get &mdash; are you at 15 in the new CNN poll? Do you believe in CNN? I mean, I know we're with FOX. But CNN spent &mdash; CNN
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I don't know exactly what &mdash; when you talk about off the record. First of all, Buzzfeed? They were the ones that said under no circumstances will I run for president. And were they wrong. But a lot of people said that.Then, I did have a meeting with the editorial board of the New York Times, a very nice meeting. Many of those things were off the record, I think at their suggestion and my suggestion. And I think being off the record is a very important thing. I think it's a very, very powerful thing.And I will say this. These three gentlemen have gone off the record many times with reporters. And I think they want to honor it, and I would always honor that.I will say, though, in terms of immigration &mdash; and almost anything else &mdash; there always has to be some, you know, tug and pull and deal. And, you know, when I watch Ted stand on the Senate floor, I had great respect for what he did. He stood there for a day-and-a- half or something. In the meantime, what came of it? Nothing. You have to be able to have some flexibility, some negotiation.Now, sometimes you ask for more than you want and you negotiate down to the point. I may have discussed something like that with the New York Times, but I would never release off-the-record conversations. I don't think it's fair, frankly, to do that to anybody.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I don't support it anymore. I do not support the ban on assault. [audience booing]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I gave many people their money back.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I gave some refunds to people because if they asked for the refunds in a certain period of time, and we gave refunds to people.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I hate the concept of it, but on a humanitarian basis, with what's happening, you have to. It's living in Hell in Syria; there's no question about it. They're living in Hell.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I have employed tens of thousands of people. [crosstalk] You haven't employed one person.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I have heard Ted say that over and over again on television, that he is the only one that can beat me. Just, for the record, I have won 10. He has won three or four. Last week, in fact, on Tuesday, I was a half a million votes higher than him. I was a million votes higher than Marco, 1 million votes. That's a lot of votes. And was by far in first place.So I keep hearing that he is the only one that can beat me but he is getting beaten very, very badly. So where does this come from? Where does it come from?
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I have no problem with it.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I have nothing to say. I mean, generally speaking, agree with what he said. I would have certainly have rather left it to the states. I was always in favor &mdash; I was very surprised when they came up with that decision.I would have certainly &mdash; I would have preferred had it been left to the states and I think most people would have preferred that.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I hope you think [inaudible]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I know what's happening with the economy. You don't know a thing.

Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I think Richard Haass is excellent. I have a lot of respect for him. I think General Keane is excellent. I think that there are &mdash; I like Colonel Jacobs very much. I see him. I know him. I have many people that I think are really excellent but in the end it's going to be my decision.When you just asked the question about Snowden, I will tell you right from the beginning, I said he was a spy and we should get him back. And if Russia respected our country, they would have sent him back immediately, but he was a spy. It didn't take me a long time to figure that one out. Believe me.But I would get the best people, people that I'd be comfortable with. And we will do the right thing.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I totally disavow the Klu Klux Klan. I totally disavow David Duke. I've been doing it now for two weeks, this is your &mdash; you're probably about the 18th person that's asked me the question. It was very clear, that question was also talked about in the form of groups. Groups, I want to know which groups are you talking about? You have to tell me which groups?Ultimately, he got to the Klu Klux Klan, which obviously I'm going to disavow. And, by the way, if you look on my Twitter account, almost immediately after the program they were disavowed again.You know, it's amazing. When I do something on Twitter, everybody picks it up, goes all over the place. But, when I did this one nobody ever picks it up. Take a look at my Twitter account.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I will say one thing, what Marco said is &mdash; I understand it. He is talking about a little give and take and a little negotiation. And you know what? That's OK. That's not the worst thing in the world.There is nothing wrong with that. I happen to be much stronger on illegal immigration. Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsed me. And if he endorses you, believe me, you are the strongest, from Arizona.But give and take is OK. And I thought what he said is OK. We may differ on the degree. But what he said to me is OK.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I will. Don't worry about it, Marco. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it little Marco, I will.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~if we went out to the proper bid. Of course you are.

Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~It's just a minor case. It's a minor case.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~It's very, very hard to get people. But other hotels do the exact same thing. And just so you understand, just again, this is a legal process. This is a procedure. It's part of the law. I take advantage of that. There's nothing wrong with it. We have no choice.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~It was elevated to an "A".
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Let me explain something. Because of the fact that the pharmaceutical companies &mdash; because of the fact that the pharmaceutical companies are not mandated to bid properly, they have hundreds of billions of dollars in waste.We don't bid properly. We don't have proper bidding procedures. The reason we don't is because they take care of all of the senators, all of the congressman, and they don't bid. They don't go out to bid.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Let me just [crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Let me just tell you, first of all, I've been hearing this man so long talking about Putin. Putin said about me &mdash; I didn't say about Putin &mdash; Putin said very nice things about me. And I say very nicely, wouldn't it be nice if actually we could get along with Russia, we could get along with foreign countries, instead of spending trillions and trillions of dollars?You're talking about Flint, Michigan. You're talking about places &mdash; we need to rebuild the infrastructure of our country. Wouldn't it be nice if we got along with the world, and maybe Russia could help us in our quest to get rid of ISIS, et cetera, et cetera?[crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Let me just tell you, you look at the Middle East. They're chopping off heads. They're chopping off the heads of Christians and anybody else that happens to be in the way. They're drowning people in steel cages. And he &mdash; now we're talking about waterboarding.This really started with Ted, a question was asked of Ted last &mdash; two debates ago about waterboarding. And Ted was, you know, having a hard time with that question, to be totally honest with you. They then came to me, what do you think of waterboarding? I said it's fine. And if we want to go stronger, I'd go stronger, too, because, frankly [applause] that's the way I feel. Can you imagine &mdash; can you imagine these people, these animals over in the Middle East, that chop off heads, sitting around talking and seeing that we're having a hard problem with waterboarding? We should go for waterboarding and we should go tougher than waterboarding. That's my opinion.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Let me tell you the real con artist. Excuse me. Excuse me. The real con artist is Senator Marco Rubio who was elected in Florida and who has the worst voting record in the United States Senate.He doesn't go to vote. He's absent. He doesn't go. Now, the people of Florida can't stand him. He couldn't get elected dogcatcher. The people of Florida &mdash; the people of Florida &mdash; and by the way, I know he's going to spend $25 million on ads. Without that he wouldn't have a chance. He's 20 points south.The people in Florida wouldn't elect him dogcatcher. He couldn't get any &mdash; he's right now 21 points down to me. And, you know

Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Megyn, I have a very strong core. [applause]I have a very strong core. But I've never seen a successful person who wasn't flexible, who didn't have a certain degree of flexibility. You have to have a certain degree of flexibility. [applause]You can't &mdash; for instance, let's say, on &mdash; on the second question, you can't say it's OK, and then you find out it's not OK, and you don't want to do anything. You have to be flexible, because you learn. I mean, before I knew the question was asked by Bill, and the next day, or the couple of days later, the question was asked by, by &mdash; you know &mdash; I was asked by a number of people, actually. I was asked by Sean, but I was asked by a number of people. But by that time, the number had increased significantly.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Mitt Romney [crosstalk]  false, totally false. And now the funny thing is he didn't talk about the hundreds of really successful jobs, the buildings all over the world that have made a fortune.[crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Nice to be with you, Megyn.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~No, I'm a big defender of the Second Amendment. And if you look at what's happened, whether it's in California, where you had the 14 people killed, whether it's in Paris &mdash; which, by the way, has the toughest gun laws in the world and 130 people killed. Many, many people in the hospital gravely injured. They will be dying. Many people will be dying in addition.If we had guns, or if they had guns on the other side of the room, with the bullets going in the opposite direction, you would not have had 130 people killed. That I can tell you right now. [applause]So I'm a very, very big supporter of the Second Amendment.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~No, I'm not playing.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~No, I don't. No, I don't.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~No, it's not. You take a look. He was the primary supporter. He pushed John Roberts, and pushed him, and pushed him, and Bush ultimately appointed him. He got appointed. And when it came his time to raise his hand and kill Obamacare, not once, but twice, he let us down, and he did the wrong thing.This is the man that was the primary supporter. And you can read law journal, you can read whatever you want to read &mdash; I've read plenty of it. There was no stronger supporter of John Roberts than him. And it was a very, very big mistake.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~No, no. Before they had the information
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~No, no. But
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~No, no. I have very good answers.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~No, no. You're the liar. You're the lying guy up here.[crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~No. I never do that. I would not do that. I don't think &mdash; I have too much respect &mdash; if I deal with you off the record, if I deal with Bret or Chris off the record, I have too much respect for that process to say, just release everything. I would not do that.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Not very flexible. No, not very flexible. I give the example &mdash; I'm going to build a wall. I'm the one that wants the wall. I'm the one that can build the wall. [applause]It's going to get built. And by the way, Mexico is going to pay for the wall. I can tell you that. Mexico is going to pay for the wall. [applause]But &mdash; and I used an example. And this isn't necessarily what was said, but whatever was said, the wall's 50 feet high. Is it going to be 45 feet or 40 feet? That could very well be. That could very well &mdash; he wants it to be higher. [laughter]That could very well be. But there's always give and take. There's always negotiation. And the best negotiator that knows what he's doing will make a great deal. But we need give and take in government. If you don't have give and take, you're never going to agree on anything. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Not what you say in the op-ed.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Now on &mdash; let me explain that. You're right. Let me explain. First time the question had been put to me, it was very early on. The migration had just started. And I had heard that the number was a very, very small number.By the second day, two or three days later, I heard the number was going to be thousands and thousands of people. You know, when they originally heard about it, they were talking about bringing very, very small numbers in.And I said, begrudgingly, well, I guess maybe that's OK. It was not like, "Let's bring them in," because I think we should build a safe zone in &mdash; we should really &mdash; what we should be doing is building safe zones so they can stay in their own country and not go all over, and at least this way we're not going to have the problem. That's what we have to do. [applause]But just &mdash; just to set &mdash; because I fully understand what you're asking. When I first heard the question, first time the question was ever asked to me, first time I really had known about the question, the migration had just started. I was very much like, OK, by the time I went back and studied it, and they were talking about bringing thousands and thousands, I changed my tune. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Oh yeah, you're

They've come to the Republican Party. And by the way, the Democrats are losing people. This is a trend that's taking place. It's the biggest thing happening in politics, and I'm very proud to be a part of it. And I'm going to give them some credit, too, even though they don't deserve it. But the answer is: Yes, I will.

But they devalue their currencies, in particular China. Mexico is doing a big number now, also. Japan is unbelievable what they're doing.They devalue their currencies, and they make it impossible for clothing-makers in this country to do clothing in this country. And if you look at what's happened on Seventh Avenue, and you look at what's happened in New York with the garment industry, so much of the clothing now comes out from Vietnam, China, and other places. And it's all because of devaluation.By the way, the Trans-Pacific, if you look at the TPP, a total disaster, which, by the way, Marco is in favor of, they need &mdash; it is a disaster for our country. It's trying to be approved by various people, including President Obama. And I'll tell you something. The biggest problem with that is: They don't take into concurrence the devaluation.

Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~We will see who's right at the end of a few years. But all of the &mdash; almost all of the people, many, many people signed what's called the report card at the end, did you like the course, how did you like it.Almost all of them said it was terrific, OK? With letters, with this. Some of them are on tape saying it was terrific. Let's see what happens at the end of three years.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well look, he was a failed candidate, he should have beaten president Obama very easy.He failed miserably, and it was an embarrassment to everybody, including the Republican party. It looked like he went away on a vacation the last month. So, I don't take that, and I guess, obviously, he wants to be relevant. He wants to be back in the game.As far as domestic policy and trade which is killing our country, he said free trade and I believe in free trade also. But, if you look at China, and you look Japan, and if you look at Mexico, both at the border, by the way, where they're killing us.Both at the border, and with trade &mdash; and every other country we do business with we are getting absolutely crushed on trade. And, he said free trade, I say free trade great. But, not when they're beating us so badly.With China we're going to lose $505 billion dollars in terms of trades. You just can't do it.Mexico, $58 billion dollars.Japan, probably about, they don't know it yet, but about $109 billion dollars.Every country we lose money with. As far as I'm concerned, we've got to reduce &mdash; we have to redo our trade deals 100 percent. I have the greatest business people in the world lined up to do it. We will make [bell ringing]  great trade deals. [cheering]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, all of a sudden, I hear for 40 years I've been involved in Washington. I have been supporting people for many years. And these people have been politicians, and they've been on both sides, Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives. I've supported everybody, because, until recently, I wasn't a politician, and I hope maybe you don't all consider me a politician right now. I hate the term politician.But I've been supporting politicians. A recent article somewhere said Donald Trump is a world-class businessman who goes out and he does get along with everybody. I've supported Democrats, and I've supported Republicans. And as a businessman, I owed that to my company, to my family, to my workers, to everybody to get along.Part of the problem we have in Washington, Chris
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, I also happened to call him a lightweight, OK? And I have said that. So I would like to take that back. He is really not that much of a lightweight. And as far as &mdash; and I have to say this, I have to say this. He hit my hands. Nobody has ever hit my hands. I have never heard of this. Look at those hands. Are they small hands? [laughter]And he referred to my hands, if they are small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there is no problem. I guarantee.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, let me just say this. I've gotten to know Marco over a period of time, believe me, he is not a leader. Believe me.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, look, you know, when a family flies into the World Trade Center, a man flies into the World Trade Center, and his family gets sent back to where they were going &mdash; and I think most of you know where they went &mdash; and, by the way, it wasn't Iraq &mdash; but they went back to a certain territory, they knew what was happening. The wife knew exactly what was happening.They left two days early, with respect to the World Trade Center, and they went back to where they went, and they watched their husband on television flying into the World Trade Center, flying into the Pentagon, and probably trying to fly into the White House, except we had some very, very brave souls on that third plane. All right? [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, OK, I never said that.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, on Afghanistan, I did mean Iraq. I think you have to stay in Afghanistan for a while, because of the fact that you're right next to Pakistan, which has nuclear weapons, and we have to protect that. Nuclear weapons change the game.And I was always against going into Iraq. In fact, I &mdash; believe me, I was always against it. There was some cases where I sort of &mdash; in one interview with a great friend of mine, and yours, Howard Stern &mdash; said that &mdash; said that [laughter]I said very meekly, long before we went in, I said very meekly, well, maybe, maybe, I don't know. By the time it got to that point, I was always against Iraq. But Afghanistan, I felt &mdash; and in that one, if you notice, I corrected it the second day. OK? Second question?
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~When they got the information it became an "A"
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Wrong
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Wrong.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Wrong. Wrong.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Wrong.[crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Yeah, finish.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Yeah, I know it is. But it's not what you said in the op-ed.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Yes, I will. Yes. I will.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Yes, it has been going for a long time.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Yes.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~You'll be here a long time.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~You're going to see, you're going to see.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~You're going to see, you don't know
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~You're looking well. You're looking well.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~You're the &mdash; you're the one. You're the one.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~You're the one. Now, let me just tell you. Let me just tell you. [crosstalk]Excuse me. Excuse me. I've given my answer, Lyin' Ted. I've given my answer.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~You defrauded the people of Florida, little Marco.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~You haven't employed in your life one person.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~You know what, let's see what happens in court. This is a civil case. Very easy to have settled. Could settle it now. Very easy to have settled. Let's see what happens at the end of a couple years when this case is over, OK?
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~All right, look, honestly, when I see people at these meetings, these town halls, where we take massive questions, and I get to spend time with them. Last night, there was a woman that came to tell me about the loss of her 15-year-old son, who took his own life.See, there's people in this country &mdash; and Ted's right &mdash; their wages haven't gone up for so long, they see the rich get richer, they believe, and they're not moving. And they put their money in the bank, and they got no interest on their money. They receive none. And their sons or daughters are living in the basement because they can't get a good job after they rang up so much college debt.What people are hungry for is, who can fix this? People want to know who &mdash; what can you do to solve the problems in Washington, to make sure that we have stronger job growth and better wages? But you know what else they're yearning for? They want to believe that they have the power to fix things where they live, and they want the power back, so they can begin to do things in their community.Now, listen, this has been going on for a long time here. And I appreciate the discussion back and forth. But there are a lot of people out there yearning for somebody who's going to bring America back, both at the leadership level and in the neighborhood, where we can begin to reignite the spirit of the United States of America. And let's stop fighting. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~And we have a joint, good human intelligence. That is called a semi-trip around the world. And if you gave me more time, I'd finish the trip.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Bret, it's very interesting to note, I think it's for the good of the record here that they took a survey of foreign policy magazines, 700 foreign policy experts, who would be the best person to conduct foreign policy of all the candidates in the race?I received 55 percent of the vote. Jeb Bush received 30 percent of the vote. And everybody else, none of them made double digits. And that's because you have to have the experience.And you know, we hear about Ronald Reagan rebuilding the military. I was there when Ronald Reagan rebuilt the military. I worked with him. I was there when Ronald Reagan rebuilt the economy. I was there, and I worked with him. I knew Ronald Reagan.And I'll leave it right there with what comes after that. You can figure that one out.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~But I'm the little engine that can. And, yeah, look, when you're in the arena, and we're in the arena. And the people out here watching &mdash; we're in the arena, we're traveling, we're working, we spend time away from our family, when you're in the arena, you enter a special circle. And you want to respect the people that you're in the arena with. So if he ends up as the nominee &mdash; sometimes, he makes it a little bit hard &mdash; but, you know, I will support whoever is the Republican nominee for president. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Can I
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I'll have to see this.[begin video clip]blockquote UNKNOWN:  If elected, Trump promised that the dictatorial duo would, quote, "make tyranny great again."
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I'm not biting. Let me take you around the world, OK? Let me &mdash; look, I'm going to take you very quickly.In Russia, we need to tell them we're going to arm the Ukrainians with defensive lethal weapons. And we're going to tell Putin if you attack anybody in Eastern Europe in NATO, you attack Finland and Sweden, which is not in NATO, consider it an attack on us. And he will understand that.Secondly, I would tell the Chinese you don't own the South China Sea. Stop hacking us. And we're going to beef up our cyber command. And we're going to be in a position to be able to take out your systems if you continue to do this.Now let's move over into the Middle East. The Egyptians, they know they're on their last legs there because of the attack from ISIS. The Jordanians are &mdash; really have been our friends. They know that they are at risk. So do the Saudis. So do the Gulf states.They are our allies, really, or have similar aims, we need to bring them closer to us. Turkey a critical avenue to the Middle East. We have to bring them towards the West, and not towards the East.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I did 200 meetings in New Hampshire, I don't know how many in Michigan now. In these townhalls people come in and they're very emotional meetings. And, you know what they really want to know? If somebody tells them something, can they believe it?And, the reason why people are so upset in this country is because politicians all the time tell them what they want to hear. And, they go to Washington, or they go to the state capital, wherever, and they don't deliver on those promises.You know, when I ran for Governor of Ohio, I said not only would we balance the budget, but we would cut taxes. People said that can't be done. I wouldn't have said it if I didn't believe it.We cut taxes in Ohio more than any governor in the country, and $5 billion dollars worth of tax cuts &mdash; we're not running a surplus in Ohio. But, you see, what's getting in the hearts and souls of the people is they want change, and they keep putting outsiders in to bring about the change, then the change doesn't come. Then they put more outsiders in because we're putting people in that don't understand compromise. They don't understand policy [bell ringing] [applause] They're getting more and more frustrated with the system which is why we must pick somebody that has a record of achievement, not just talk.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Megyn.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~No, I [crosstalk]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Not just talk, but a record of achievement. That's how we'll restore credibility..
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Of course.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Thank you.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~That was a pretty good one.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~The reason it happens
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, Bret, I think we're all really there. I mean, the simple fact is that, you know, you all wrote me off. You wrote me off before I even got to New Hampshire, then when I finished in New Hampshire you wrote me off in the South, then you wrote me off in Super Tuesday.I split delegates in Vermont with Donald Trump, I finished second in Massachusetts, and we won delegates in Virginia. But, guess what? It's now March Madness and we're heading up North to the place &mdash; to my turf, OK? [cheering]And, let me just tell you this, I will win Ohio, and I am going to move all across this country, and over time as people begin to finally hear my message &mdash; you know what people say, Bret, to me all the time?Why don't they give you any time on the debate stage? Why is that? [cheering]So now all of a sudden, I'm starting to get it, and what I want the people to know is, I know how to bring people together, Republicans and Democrats. I have successfully, both at the federal level and the state level brought economic growth, wage growth, and economic security to this country.And I want to go back and do it again, and I'm going to keep talking about my message of bringing people together and motivating people in the neighborhoods that realize they don't need somebody from Washington galloping in. There are many things they can do where they live, because the strength of our country is in our neighborhoods and our families. And I'm going to keep doing this. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, first of all, just to be clear, not only did I serve for 18 years on the Defense Committee, more than anybody on this stage, but, secondly, I was called into the Pentagon after 9/11 to help Secretary Rumsfeld with some of his difficulties.I will say, look, let me tell you what happened with Libya. And I pointed out in the last debate &mdash; Hillary Clinton worked aggressively to depose Moammar Gadhafi. We had no business doing it. He was working with us. He was cooperating with us. He denuclearized. And now they pushed him out, and now we have a fertile ground for ISIS.Fortunately in Libya, there's only a few cities on the coast, because most of Libya is a desert. The fact of the matter is, we absolutely have to be &mdash; and not just with special forces. I mean, that's not going to work. Come on. You've got to go back to the invasion when we pushed Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. We have to be there on the ground in significant numbers. We do have to include our Muslim Arab friends to work with us on that. And we have to be in the air.And we &mdash; it should be a broad coalition, made up of the kinds of people that were involved when we defeated Saddam. Now, you've got to be on the ground and in the air both in Syria and Iraq. And at some point, we will have to deal with Libya. I am very concerned about ISIS getting their hands on the oilfields in Libya and being able to fund their operations. The fact is cool, calm, deliberate, effective, take care of the job, and then come home. That's what we need to do with our military foreign policy. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, ladies and gentlemen, I love being here in Michigan, and I want to say to all of you here that I have a record of being able to solve some of the biggest problems. It's not just talk, and it's not theory.I did it in Washington by helping people get into a healthier economic situation. I've done it in Ohio. And as we've made progress in Ohio, we've left no one behind. We've not left behind the mentally ill, the drug addicted, the working poor, the developmental disabled, and we have raised our minority community.And as president of the United States, I will go back to Washington, I will take the formulas that I used, and I will &mdash; I will fix the problems in Washington, and you'll work with me as I send you power to fix your &mdash; your communities, your neighborhoods, your state, and together, we'll restore the spirit of America. And I know you want that. Thank you. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, look, first of all, I think the mayor now is controlling the schools. This is not much different than what happened in Cleveland, Ohio, where the African-American Democrat mayor, the union, and business leaders came to see me and said, "Would you help us to pass legislation to really create a CEO environment so that we can take control of the schools?"We even invested in a buyout plan, where we bought out the teachers who had been there a long time, because there were so many young teachers who had been laid off who were so enthusiastic to get back in the schools. It worked beautifully. Cleveland's coming back. The Cleveland schools are coming back because of a major overhaul.It's the same thing that has to happen in all of our urban schools. And, frankly, look, if I were president, I'd take 104 federal programs, bundle them into four buckets, and send it to the states, because fixing schools rests at the state and the local level, and particularly at the school board level. [applause]Now, I also believe &mdash; I also believe that you need to introduce vocational education in those schools. You need mentoring in those schools. And you need to have a situation where people can have an alternative forum to get a degree. And you need school choice, both vouchers and charter schools. All of those things can come together to help, Megyn.But here's the bottom line. And I'll go quickly. We as adults have to fight in our neighborhoods, in our communities, for our children's education. Put the politics aside, and everyone in this room can play a role in lifting their schools and lifting the students who are in those schools, because too much politics gets in the middle of it, and where we focus as adults, and put children first, we see tremendous results. And the people of this town are going to rise. And they need to be involved. Thank you. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, look, first of all, I try to be a man of faith every day as best as I can, and I try to focus in my faith on the dos and I think the don'ts will take care of themselves once I get the dos right, which is humility, and loving my enemy, and caring for my neighbor.But secondly, look, you're in the commerce business, you want to sell somebody a cupcake, great. OK? But now if they ask you to participate in something you really don't like, that's a whole 'nother issue, OK? Another issue.Here's what I'd like to see happen. The Supreme Court ruled, I don't agree with the ruling. I'm of favor of marriage between &mdash; you know, traditional marriage, a man and a woman. What I hope was going to happen after the Supreme Court ruling is things would settle down.If you go to a photographer to take pictures at your wedding, and he says, I'd rather not do it, find another photographer, don't sue them in court. You know what, the problem is in our country &mdash; in our country, we need to learn to respect each other and be a little bit more tolerant for one another.And at the end of the day, don't go to court. Can't we have common sense in America? That's the way it used to be. And there was a book written called "The Death of Common Sense." We need to bring it back.But at the end of the day, if somebody is being pressured to participate in something that is against their deeply-held religious beliefs, then we're going to have to think about dealing with the law.But you know what, I'd rather people figure this out without having to put another law on the books and have more arguments in this country. Why don't we come together as a country, respect one another, love one another and lift this country? I think that's what people want.So thanks for asking.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, states &mdash; if states want to do it, they ought to sit down with businesspeople and the lawmakers and figure out what will work. But hold on a second here with everything else.I'm the only person on this stage who actually was the chief architect of balancing the federal budget. It's not a theory for me. It's not &mdash; it's not some &mdash; you have to know how to put everything together. And you know, I spent 10 years of my life to get there, and I did not do that because I'm worshiping at some balanced budget shrine.The reason I did it is when you have commonsense regulations, lower taxes on individuals and businesses, and you have a fiscal plan that makes sense, the job creators will expand employment. And what happened? When I was there, the jobs were exploding. Bill Clinton's tried to take credit for it. When I went to Ohio, we're up 400,000 jobs. It's the same formula.But it isn't easy. I fought the entire Washington establishment and won, because when you balance a budget, you must affect every single thing. Everything in the federal government specifically. You cannot get there with theories or broad statements, and you have to be willing to take the heat. In fact, I fought a Republican president, who I thought was not offering constructive proposals to fix this economy.So when we talk about all this, there's one person on this stage and one person who's been a candidate for president in either party that restored economic strength, growth, a balanced budget, paid down debt, cut taxes, the things that people in this country want. No theories. Reality. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, well, wait a minute, first of all, I didn't say I was for an increase in the federal minimum wage. I said in Ohio we increased it modestly every single year. So I'm not for a federal minimum wage increase.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Yeah. But &mdash; and I kind of think that, before it's all said and done, I'll be the nominee. But let me also say [applause]But let me also say, remember
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~You know, the reason is because, as the Democrats tell me all the time, I can get the crossover votes. You see, because throughout this campaign I've talked about issues, I have never tried to go and get into these scrums that we're seeing here on the stage. And, people say everywhere I go, "you seem to be the adult on the stage." [applause]In terms of &mdash; you know, Mitt Romney's a great guy, but he doesn't determine my strategy. The fact of the matter is I'm running for president because I worked hard to fix this country when I was in Washington as the Chairman of the Budget Committee where we had some of the most significant job growth after we balanced the budget.We had wages going up, it was very successful in Ohio. Our wages grow faster than the national average. We're up over 400,000 jobs. We paid down, back in the old days, they paid down half a trillion dollars of the national debt. It's a formula that works. And, I believe that formula will work when I return to Washington as the president.And, by the way, I won't need on the job training because I know how to do all of this, and within the first 100 days I will have a plan that will pass the Congress because [bell ringing]  It is reasonable, and I can bring both sides together [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~You know, this so much about process. It frankly is boring to me. I would like it clear though, since we're talking about polls, I beat Hillary Clinton by more than 11 points, and the reason it happens [cheering]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~[inaudible]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~[inaudible] this anymore.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~A third of the people [inaudible]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~All of these companies he has ruined.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~All right, I'm going to finish my statement here.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~All right, well, let's hear it big Donald.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~And he's also sowing instability in the Middle East. You have Iran who's going to get $100 billion of sanctions relief. You have radical jihadists spreading all over the world. This is a time for seriousness on these issues. You have yet to answer a single serious question about any of this. Will you give us a detailed answer about foreign policy any time you're asked on it?
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~And he's asking us to make him the president of the United States of America. [crosstalk] [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~And with that money, he lost more money than he made.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~And, here's why he does it this way, let me explain why he [inaudible] H2-B
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~And, our nominee needs to be someone that stands by those things
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~And, we're not going to do that to our country
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~As few as possible. The Second Amendment, as I've said before, is not a suggestion. It is the constitutional right of every American to protect themselves and their families. It is a right that &mdash; it is the Second Amendment for a reason.It is right after the defense of the freedom of speech for a reason, for clearly the founders of our nation understood and the framers of the Constitution understood that you cannot have life and you cannot have liberty and cannot pursue happiness if you are not safe. RUBIO:  And the Second Amendment &mdash; when people talk about gun laws, what they need to realize is, criminals don't follow gun laws. They're criminals. By definition, they ignore the law. [applause]But the gun rights of Americans, if you are talking to a law- abiding citizen and a gun-owner like myself, if you pass a law, I will follow whatever the law is. A criminal will not do it. They will continue to pursue these guns on the black market, where they then go out and commit crimes and they steal guns from each other.Gun laws are not effective. They simply do not provide for safety. But they do, however, ensure that law-abiding people don't have access to weapons to protect themselves and guns to protect themselves, but criminals always will be well armed. They don't care about the law; they don't follow the law. We will protect the Second Amendment when I'm president of the United States. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~because it is a major issue, in your campaign that you've made a center issue. Now, as far as my record on it is concerned, I absolutely want to solve this issue. And I did the best we could in a Senate that was controlled by liberal Democrats and Harry Reid in the hopes that the House, made up of conservatives, would take it up and make it even stronger. And I said that repeatedly at the time.I'm not just saying that now; I said it throughout that process. We do need to do with this issue. [audience booing]When I'm president it will not be dealt with the way it was done in the Senate.It will be done first and foremost by bringing illegal immigration under control and proving it to the American people. And only after that is done can anything else happen.And it will be something the American people support. We'll see what they are willing to support. It's not going to be an executive order and we're not going to ram it down their throats.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Because when you bring them in this way, when you bring someone in on one of these visas they can't go work for anybody else. They either work for you or they have to go back home. You basically have them captive, so you don't have to worry about competing for higher wages with another hotel down the street. And, that's why you bring workers from abroad.You argue that you're here to fight on behalf of the American worker, but when you have chances to help the American worker [bell ringing] but when you have chances to help the American workers, you're making your clothes overseas and you're hiring your workers from overseas. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~But he doesn't answer the employment question.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~But that doesn't answer the question. [crosstalk]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Correct.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Donald has not demonstrated that.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Donald, you said he's a strong leader.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Go on my website, Marco Rubio.com
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~have been interviewed
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~He can start tonight by announcing that all the Donald Trump clothing will no longer be made in China and in Mexico, but will be made here in the United States. [applause]And on the issue of job creation, I find this interesting. The private sector creates jobs. The jobs of those of us in public service are to put in place policies that allow the economy to grow.That's the problem with the Democratic Party. They think government is what creates jobs. Government does not create jobs.Now, the way you create jobs is you make America the easiest and the best place in the world to start a business or to expand an existing business. If you go on my website, marcorubio.com, you will see a real plan to fix our taxes, to roll back regulations, to repeal and replace Obamacare, not just lines around the states. Serious policies and proposals.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~He has defrauding people out of things, and not just &mdash; and not just, by the way, on the issue of Trump University. He had another development in Mexico that he had nothing to do with except his name on the building. People put money into that building.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~He is now dividing Europe up
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Here we go.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Here we go. It's personal. [audience booing][crosstalk]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I'll support Donald if he's the Republican nominee, and let me tell you why. Because the Democrats have two people left in the race. One of them is a socialist. America doesn't want to be a socialist country. If you want to be a socialist country, then move to a socialist country.The other one is under FBI investigation. And not only is she under FBI investigation, she lied to the families of the victims of Benghazi, and anyone who lies to the families of victims who lost their lives in the service of our country can never be the commander- in-chief of the United States.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I'll support the Republican nominee.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I spoke to one of the victims yesterday.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~If you're our nominee [inaudible]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~If you're our nominee, we will lose
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~If you go on my website, marcorubio.com, everything we have on there is made in America. The reason why he makes it in China or Mexico is because he can make more money on it. That's why he's doing it.And the second point, you see what happens, again, when you challenge him on a policy issue. You asked him about the economy, and the first thing he does is launch an attack about some little guy thing. Because he doesn't have answers.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Is so relevant here. I saw this video last week where he's sitting in front of a camera saying we're going to hire the best people, and I'm going to hand pick them. There are going to be hand picked and instructors, the best instructors in the world. One of them, but the way, was the manager at a Buffalo Wild Wing. And, that's who they hired to do this, and people borrowed money, and they signed up for this fake university.And, these people owe all this money now, and they got nothing in return for it, but you are willing to say whatever you had to say [bell ringing] to get them to give you their money
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Let's see if he answers it.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~let's talk about Donald Trump's strategy and my strategy and Ted's strategy and John Kasich's strategy when it comes to ISIS. And on health care and on the important issues facing this country.But let's be honest too about all this. The media has given these personal attacks that Donald Trump has made an incredible amount of coverage. Let's start talking again about the issues that matter to this country. I'm ready to do that starting right here right now tonight.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Megyn, this is why this is relevant to this election.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~No, there are several. Obviously there are so many, I can't talk to them every day. I spoke to one of them, he told me exactly what happened. They signed up for this course because they believed Mr. Trump was this fantastic businessman, that Donald is going to teach them the tricks of the trade.They signed up. They paid $15,000 for this course. They were asked for additional money for this course. If they really wanted the real secrets of success, they had to pay even more money, and so they did.And you know what they got in these courses? Stuff you can pull off of Zillow. When they finally realized what a scam it was, they asked for their money back.And you refused to give them their money back. Why don't you tonight
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Notice that's not an answer.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Of all the people on this stage, he performs the worst against Hillary Clinton.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Oh, excuse me [inaudible]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~That's correct, and Libya.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~That's false
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~That's not accurate. I'm sorry, Megyn, that's not accurate. That's my &mdash; there were at least 300 Americans that applied last year, none of them were hired. Some of them
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~The answer is, he's not going to do it. And you know why? Because there are plenty of clothing makers in America. [applause][crosstalk]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~The Better Business Bureau gave it a "D" minus.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Then why don't you tonight say you're going to give the money back to everybody who wants
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~There's a difference between flexibility and telling people whatever you think you need to say to get them to do what you want them to do. [cheering]   And, that's what Donald has done throughout his career.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~There's no &mdash; as you can see in his answer, it's always the same thing.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~There were Americans in that hot area.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~They lost their money. Yes, licensing, but you told them you owned the building. So they gave him his money. They lost their money. Time and again
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~They were not hired
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~This is not a game.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~This is why, because he's trying to do to the American voter what he did to the people that signed up for this course. He's making promises he has no intention of keeping. And it won't just be $36,000 that they lose, it's our country that's at stake here.The future of the United States and the most important election in a generation, and he's trying to con people into giving them their vote just like he conned these people into giving him their money.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~This isn't just about flexibility.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~To someone who time and again on issue after issue has not proven that he has the principals [bell ringing]  That outline what the conservative movement has been about. And, as Ted said, the things that made America great.America is great because of the conservative principles of limited government and free enterprise, and a strong national defense
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Trump Steaks is gone. You have ruined these companies.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Unbelievable.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~We must defeat Hillary Clinton.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, Bret, what I've argued from the very beginning is ISIS &mdash; in order to defeat ISIS, you must deny them operating spaces. This is how ISIS or any radical group, for that matter, can grow. It's how Al Qaida was able to carry out 9/11, is that the Taliban gave them an operating space in Afghanistan.Today that operating space has largely been based in Iraq and Syria, but I've been warning about the Libyan presence for the better part of two years. So they need to be targeted wherever they have an operating space. They do need to be defeated on the ground by a ground force made up primarily of Sunni Arabs themselves. This is a radical Sunni movement. They can only be defeated if they are driven out and the territory is held by Sunni Arabs. But it will require a specific number of American special operators, in combination with an increase in air strikes. And that will include, if necessary, operating spaces in Libya, which, in fact, they are using to project into the Sinai against Egypt and ultimately into Europe, as well.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, first of all, government doesn't [audience booing]First of all, Chris, my point is exactly right. He has spent a career of convincing Americans that he's something that he's not in exchange for their money. Now he's trying to do the same in exchange for their country. This is a fact. He talks about these great businesses that he's built. He inherited over $100 million.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, first of all, I think, as we've seen throughout this campaign, Donald has not shown a seriousness about the issues of foreign policy. He just simply hasn't.Whether it was the structure of our military, even today he was asked a question about the issue of commanders not following his lead on killing the family of terrorists. And his answer basically was, if I tell them to do it, they're going to do it. Now that's just not true.Foreign policy is not only consequential, I think much of our future now depends on it. You know, I see a lot of young people at my events around the country. I feel great when they come.And I always them that despite the hardships of the moment, I honestly believe that today's Millennials have a chance to be the greatest generation we've had in 100 years. I really do.Because the world today has hundreds of millions of people that can afford to be their clients, their customers, their partners, people they collaborate with. But that won't happen if the world is dangerous and it's unstable.And that will require strong American leadership. The next president of the United States is going to have eight years of a mess of a foreign policy to clean up. That's why it can't be Hillary Clinton.And quite frankly, that's why it can't be someone who simply has not shown the intellectual curiosity or the interest in learning about these very complicated issues. And Donald simply hasn't.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, first of all, let me say that on the issue of the off-the-record, that's not up to the New York Times. That's up to you, Donald. If tonight you tell the New York Times to release the audio, they will do it, and we can exactly see what your true views are on immigration
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, he's very flexible, so you never know. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, he did, and that's why Trump University
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, I know I've talked about it, and others in our campaign have talked about it, and other candidates have talked about it, as well. What happened in Flint was a terrible thing. It was systemic breakdown at every level of government, at both the federal and partially the &mdash; both the state and partially at the federal level, as well.And by the way, the politicizing of it I think is unfair, because I don't think that someone woke up one morning and said, "Let's figure out how to poison the water system to hurt someone." [applause]But accountability is important. I will say, I give the governor credit. He took responsibility for what happened. And he's talked about people being held accountable [applause] and the need for change, with Governor Snyder. But here's the point. This should not be a partisan issue. The way the Democrats have tried to turn this into a partisan issue, that somehow Republicans woke up in the morning and decided, "Oh, it's a good idea to poison some kids with lead." It's absurd. It's outrageous. It isn't true. [applause]All of us are outraged by what happened. And we should work together to solve it. And there is a proper role for the government to play at the federal level, in helping local communities to respond to a catastrophe of this kind, not just to deal with the people that have been impacted by it, but to ensure that something like this never happens again.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, I know this has been an unusual election cycle, as it continues, and there's a lot of problems in America, and people are truly hurting. But this election is not just about confronting our problems; it's also about embracing our opportunities.I believe the 21st century holds the potential to be the greatest era in the history of the United States, if we get this election right and if we act now. If we do, if we do what needs to be done, we can leave our children as the freest and most prosperous Americans that have ever lived, and the 21st century can be the greatest era in the amazing story of America. So I ask everyone to vote for me and join our effort at marcorubio.com. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, then answer the economy question.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~When they're done with the yoga, can I answer a question?
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Yeah, I just want to &mdash; a couple points. Once again, he was pressed on a policy issue to show his understanding of the foreign policy, and his reaction was just to attack somebody else with a name.Here's the bottom line. And I'm going to repeat it again. The world today is as complicated and as complex as it has been certainly in a very &mdash; certainly in the lifetime of anybody here today. You indeed do have a lunatic in North Korea with nuclear weapons. You indeed do have the Chinese government taking over the most important shipping lane in the world. And Vladimir Putin, who you've expressed admiration for, Donald
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Yes, I would just say a couple of things. There is no doubt that Donald has done well in these elections. There is no doubt about that. The numbers are there.Here is what the numbers also say. Two-thirds of the people who have cast a vote in a Republican primary or caucus have voted against you. They do not want you to be our nominee.And, the reason why is because we are not going to turn over the conservative movement, or the party of Lincoln or Reagan, for example, to someone whose positions are not conservative. To someone who last week defended Planned Parenthood for 30 seconds a debate stage. To someone, for example, that has no ideas on foreign &mdash; someone who thinks the nuclear triad is a rock band from the 1980's.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Yes, you know, Bret, let me say something. This campaign for the last year Donald Trump has basically mocked everybody with personal attacks. He has done so to people that are sitting on the stage today. He has done so about people that are disabled. He has done it about every candidate in this race.So if there is anyone who has ever deserved to be attacked that way, it has been Donald Trump, for the way he has treated people in the campaign.Now that said, I would much prefer to have a policy debate. I hope that's what we will have here tonight. Let's have a policy debate
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~You've expressed admiration for him.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~You ever heard of Trump Steaks? You ever heard of Trump Vodka?
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~You lose by [inaudible] points. She will wipe you out.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~abusing American workers
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~All right, I'll respond [crosstalk]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~All right, well, Donald lives by the polls every day. He tweets about the polls.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~And any justice that Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer sign off on
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~And I would point out, Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer are both Democrats that Mr. Trump has written checks to repeatedly. Any justice that those two sign off on is going to be a left-wing judicial activist who will undermine religious liberty, and we are one vote away from the Heller decision being overturned, which would effectively erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights.If you care about the Second Amendment, then you need to ask who on this stage do you know will appoint principled constitutionalists to the court and not cut a deal with your Second Amendment rights?
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~And with Hillary Clinton
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Because we've been lied to too many times.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Bret, you know, I think the American people understand that yelling and cursing at people doesn't make you a tough guy. We need a commander-in-chief that, number one, will rebuild the military, just like Ronald Reagan did in 1981 coming out of the weak Jimmy Carter administration. He passed tax reform and regulatory reform. The economy took off. It generated millions in high-paying jobs, trillions in new revenue. He rebuilt the military, bankrupted the Soviet Union, and won the Cold War.As president, I will do the exact same thing with radical Islamic terrorism. We will rebuild this military so that it remains the mightiest fighting force on the face of the planet. And then, when I am commander-in-chief, every militant on the face of the Earth will understand that if they go and join ISIS, if they wage jihad against the United States of America, they are signing their death warrant. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~But if, in fact, you went to Manhattan and said I'm lying to the American people, then the voters have a right to know.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~But what would you say
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~But you cannot, in fact, care about conservative Supreme Court justices and support Jimmy Carter for president. You cannot care about conservative Supreme Court justices and support John Kerry for president, as Donald did. You cannot care about conservative Supreme Court justices and support Harry Reid for Senate majority leader.And you cannot care about conservative Supreme Court justices and write four checks to Hillary Clinton for her to be president if you care at all about the Second Amendment or religious liberty or anything else.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~But, Donald, please, I know it's hard not to interrupt. But try.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Count to 10, Donald. Count to 10.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Count to 10. The stakes are too high and if you are one of the 65 to 70 percent of Republicans who recognize that nominating Donald would be a disaster, then I ask you to come join us. If you're supporting other candidates, come join us.We welcome you to our team because we've demonstrated not once, not twice, not three times, but five separate times we have beat Donald. And if you don't want him to be the nominee, then I ask you to stand with us as a broad coalition of people who believe in the Constitution, believe in freedom, and want to turn this country around.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Donald, learn not to interrupt. It's not complicated.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Donald, you could resolve this issue very quickly by simply [audience booing] releasing the New York Times tape. Because, listen, maybe it's right.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~He's told us to look to the CNN poll. Well, that's a very good poll to look to, because that CNN poll showed that head to head Donald Trump loses to Hillary Clinton by 8 points. He doesn't just lose close; he loses by 8 points. That same poll he told you to look at shows me beating Hillary Clinton. [applause]We cannot mess this up. And, by the way, the last four polls in a row, when you nominate a candidate who literally has been on every side of every issue, and in the course of this debate may be on two other sides before we're done, that's not how you win. And the stakes are too high. [crosstalk]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~His record right now is one of repeatedly hiring illegal aliens
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I really hope that we don't &mdash; we don't see yoga on this stage.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~I want to talk to every soldier and sailor and airman and Marine. I want to talk to every mom and dad and sister and brother and son and daughter of someone fighting for this country. For seven years, you've had a commander-in-chief that doesn't believe in you, that sends you into combat with rules of engagement that tie your arms behind your back. That is wrong. It is immoral. And in January 2017, it will end.I want to also talk to all the police officers and firefighters and first responders who have been left behind with this president. Starting in January 2017, I will have your back. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~if Donald actually cared about
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~If you didn't tell them that, the tapes will prove you're innocent.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Megyn, let me ask the voters at home, is this the debate you want playing out in the general election? The stakes in this election are too high. For seven years, millions of Americans, we've been struggling, wages have been stagnating, people are hurting, our constitutional rights are under assault.And if we nominate Donald, we're going to spend the spring, the fall, and the summer with the Republican nominee facing a fraud trial
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~pointing out that he supported her four times in her presidential race.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~So I'd like to ask Donald, why did you write checks to Hillary Clinton to be president in 2008? It wasn't for business. And how can you stand on a debate stage now with her and say you don't think she should be president? [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~So my simple flat tax I have rolled out in precise detail how it will operate where every American can fill out our taxes on a postcard. And if you want to actually see the postcard, see all the details, you can find them on our Web site. It's tedcruz.org.When he we get rid of all the corporate welfare, all the subsidies, all the carve-outs in the IRS code, it dramatically simplifies it. And under Obama, the IRS has become so corrupt and so politicized we need to abolish it all together.Now, at the end of that there will still be an office in the Treasury Department to receive the postcards but it will be dramatically simpler. And let me take a moment, Chris, to go back to go back to this exchange that was going on.In between all of the insults, let me point out the specificity that was lacking. It's very easy to say, "Let's cut waste, fraud, and abuse." I've rolled out a detailed plan to cut $500 billion in federal spending, specifying exactly what I would cut. [applause]It's easy to say it, but one of the great disconnects to all the people, all of the voters, I understand the folks who are supporting Donald right now. You're angry. You're angry at Washington, and he uses angry rhetoric.But for 40 years, Donald has been part of the corruption in Washington that you're angry about. [applause]And you're not going to stop the corruption in Washington by supporting someone who has supported liberal Democrats for four decades, from Jimmy Carter to John Kerry to Hillary Clinton. You're not going to stop the corruption and the cronyism by supporting someone who has used government power for private gain. Instead, we need a president who stands with the American people. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~That's flat-out wrong.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~that you didn't tell them you're misleading the American people. If that's the case
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~The way you bring manufacturing back to America is, number one, you lift the regulations. As president, I will repeal Obamacare, the biggest job-killer in America.I will pull back the federal regulators, the EPA and all the regulators that are killing small businesses and manufacturing.And my tax plan, which is a very, very detailed plan on the website, tedcruz.org, is what's called border adjustable. We get rid of all the taxes. We get rid of the corporate income tax and the death tax and the Obamacare taxes and the payroll tax. And we replace it with a 16 percent business flat tax that is border adjustable, which means all exports are entirely tax-free and all imports pay the 16 percent business flat tax. That's a 32 percent differential.What that will do, Chris, is bring millions of manufacturing jobs back to this country, bring the steel industry back to this country, create an environment where when we compete on a fair and level playing field, American ingenuity can beat anyone. But right now, the federal government isn't giving us a level playing field.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~to Hillary Clinton on the debate stage when you wrote her a check in 2008, wrote her four checks to be president?
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, Bret, as someone who spent much of his life in law enforcement, I believe you should start with the facts and evidence first before ending up with the verdict. When the news first broke of the United States government engaging in massive surveillance on American citizens, that was a very troubling development, and it's why the United States Congress acted to correct it.Now, at the same time, I said in that initial statement that if the evidence indicated that Edward Snowden violated the law, he should be prosecuted for violating the law. And, indeed, since then, the evidence is clear that not only does Snowden violate the law, but it appears he committed treason. Treason is defined under the Constitution as giving aid and comfort to the enemies of America, and what Snowden did made it easier for terrorists to avoid detection.And Snowden's comments afterwards, and his behavior afterwards, he fled to Russia, he fled to China. His conducts afterwards indicates that he was not a whistleblower, but instead he was undermining the ability to defend this country. But we need a president who isn't rash, who doesn't just pop off at the &mdash; at the hip, but waits to see what the facts are and then acts to defend this country. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, Chris, thank you for that question. Let me start by observing that Detroit is a great city with a magnificent legacy that has been utterly decimated by 60 years of failed left-wing policy. [applause]You know, Henry Ford revolutionized automobile manufacturing and brought automobiles to the middle class. During World War II, Detroit provided &mdash; funded the arsenals of democracy to help us win World War II. In &mdash; in the 1960s, Detroit was the Silicon Valley of America. It had a population of 2 million people, had the highest per capita income in the country.And then, for 50 years, left-wing Democrats have pursued destructive tax policies, weak crime policies, and have driven the citizens out. [applause]This city now has just 700,000 citizens. There are vacant homes, one after the other after the other. Crime has been rampant, and it is an outrage. And let me say to folks in the media: That is a story that the media ought to be telling over and over again, the destruction of left-wing policies and the millions who have hurt because of it. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, listen, adoption is decided at the state level and I am a believer in the 10th Amendment in the Constitution, I would leave the question of marriage to the states, I would leave the question of adoption to the states.That's the way it has been for two centuries of our nation's history until five unelected judges in an illegitimate and wrong decision decided to seize the authority over marriage and wrongfully tear down the marriage laws of all 50 states.Now, interconnected to this is the question of religious liberty. And at the last debate, one of my colleagues on this stage said on the question of religious liberty and Supreme Court nominees that he'd be willing to compromise and negotiate.I can tell you, for me, there are areas that we should compromise on. Marginal tax rates, we can reach a middle ground on. But when it comes to core principles and convictions, when it comes to the Constitution and Bill of Rights, I can tell the men and women at home I will never compromise away your religious liberty.And for me, Bret, religious liberty has been a lifelong passion. I've spent two decades defending religious liberty, including defending the Ten Commandments before the U.S. Supreme Court and winning. Defending the Pledge of Allegiance before the Supreme Court and winning.And defending the Mojave Desert Veterans Memorial, a lone white Latin cross that was erected to honor the men and women who gave their lives in World War I. I represented 3 million veterans for free defending that memorial and we won 5-4 before the Supreme Court.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, listen, unlike Donald, I would not support banning firearms. In that instance, Bill Clinton banned many of the most popular firearms in America. And by the way, the study showed that ban did nothing to reduce violent crime. It just took away the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. [applause]And let me point out, you know, it is easy for political candidates to have rhetoric and say, "I support the Second Amendment." But you cannot say that and at the same time say what Donald just said, which is that on the question of Supreme Court nominees he wants to compromise and reach a middle ground with Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer. That's what he said in the last debate.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, Megyn, you know, at the end of the day for the folks at home, this is not about the insults back and forth between the candidates. This is not about what attacks we can throw at each other. This is the people at home who are struggling through seven years of Barack Obama.This is the single moms who are working two and three jobs, 28, 29 hours a week because their hours have been forcibly reduced because of Obamacare. This is the truck drivers and the steel workers and the mechanics with calluses on their hands who have seen their wages not grow year after year after year while the cost of living goes up.This is all the young people coming out of school with student loans up to their eyeballs that aren't able to find a job.And I don't think the people of America are interested in a bunch of bickering school children. They are interested in solutions, not slogans. It's easy to say, make things better, make things great. You can even print it and put it on a baseball cap.But the question is, do you understand the principles that made America great in the first place? As president, I will repeal every word of Obamacare. I will pull back the regulators that are killing small businesses.And we will pass a simple flat tax and abolish the IRS. And what that's going to do, Megyn, is small businesses are going to explode. We are going to see millions of high-paying jobs. We are going to see wages going up. We are going to see opportunity.That's where our focus needs to be. That's where my focus is. And that is why our campaign is the only campaign that over and over again has beaten Donald Trump to date, and it's why we are the one campaign that going forward can and will beat Donald Trump in this election.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, the abuse of the H1-B program has been rampant. On the face of that H1-B abuse, I have proposed, and promised as president that I will impose a 180 day moratorium on the H1B program to implement a comprehensive investigation and audit because you got U.S. companies that are firing American workers, bringing in foreign workers, and forcing them to train their replacements.And, I would note that is not dissimilar to what we discovered at the last debate concerning the hotel that Donald owns down in Florida. Down in Florida that hotel has brought in hundreds of foreign workers, and afterwards it was really striking.I watched the CNN interview Donald did where he explained, he said, well the problem is you can't find Americans who are qualified, or who want to work as waiters and waitresses. Now, let me ask the people here, how many people have worked as a waiter or waitress? [applause]Millions across this country. That is an astonishing statement. You know, Marco's Dad started as a bartender. My Dad started washing dishes, and yet, you know how many Americans wanted those jobs? [bell ringing]Roughly 300 applied, Donald hired 17. And, that's why this New York Times tape is so troubling because what's been reported is that Donald told the Editorial Board of the New York Times what I'm saying on immigration, I don't believe. I'm not going to build a wall, I'm not going to deport people, this is all just rhetoric for the voters.Now, if he didn't say that, he has an easy solution. Simply release the tape.But, for everyone at home who's mad at politicians that lied to us, Donald's record right now as he standing here
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Well, you're right, the news is very disturbing that Kim Jong-un has put their nuclear weapons on ready state. I'm glad that we're sending another carrier group to the South China Sea. I'm glad that Congress passed sanctions on North Korea.But this is all the result of the failures of the Clinton administration two decades ago that negotiated a deal with North Korea lifting the sanctions, allowing billions of dollars to flow in, and they used that money to develop nuclear weapons in the first place.What we &mdash; now we're in a much harder position. When you have a lunatic with nuclear weapons, to some extent, it constrains your options. We need to be moving the carrier &mdash; carrier group to the South China Seas. We &mdash; we need to be putting in place missile defense, such as the THAAD missile defense system in South Korea.We need to be pursuing space-based missile defense. One of the advantages of space-based missile defense is that if you have a missile launch in North Korea or you have a missile launch in Iran, a space-based missile defense can take out one or two or three missiles before it can cross over and do damage.And we also need to be putting pressure on China, because North Korea is effectively a &mdash; a client state of China. All of that will happen with a strong commander-in-chief that is devoted to keeping this country safe.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~why did you give my campaign and my foundation $100,000?
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Why don't you release the tapes? Release the tapes.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~with Hillary Clinton saying
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Yes, because I gave my word that I would. And what I have endeavored to do every day in the Senate is do what I said I would do. You know, just on Tuesday, we saw an overwhelming victory in the state of Texas where I won Texas by 17 percent.And I will say it was a powerful affirmation that the people who know me best, the people who I campaigned, who made promises that if you elect me, I'll lead the fight against Obamacare, I'll lead the fight against amnesty, I'll lead the fight against our debt, and I will fight for the Bill of Rights and your rights every day, that the people of Texas said you have kept your word, and that's what I'll do as president.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Yes, their choice is very clear. If you look to the actual record &mdash; you know, Donald mentioned a moment ago that he was just doing business when he was writing checks to liberal Democrats. But that's not, in fact, the checks he was writing.Listen, we could all understand if you write a check to a city commission because you're looking for a zoning waiver on building a building. That may be corrupt, but you could understand real estate developers doing that. CRUZ:  That's not what Donald Trump did. Donald Trump supported Jimmy Carter over Ronald Reagan. Donald supported John Kerry over George W. Bush. If you don't like Obamacare, Donald Trump funded Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi taking over Congress to pass Obamacare.On immigration, if you don't like amnesty, if you don't like the Gang of Eight, Donald Trump funded five of the eight members of the Gang of Eight $50,000.And let's talk about this election. The choice Republican primary voters are making is who is best prepared to stand up to Hillary Clinton and beat Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump has written checks to Hillary Clinton not once, not twice, not three times. Ten times. And four of those checks were not to her Senate campaign. It wasn't that she was the New York senator and it was a cost of doing business. It was to her presidential campaign.Donald Trump in 2008 wrote four checks to elect Hillary Clinton as president.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~Yes. Yes.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~You can do it. You can breathe. I know it's hard. I know it's hard. But just
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~You cannot. [laughter]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Detroit, Michigan~March 3, 2016~You know, Donald has a tenuous relationship with the truth. [laughter]I wrote one op-ed supporting President Bush's nomination after he made it. I would not have made that nomination. But let me point out
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~All right. Well, first of all, you know, so many people have said to me, "You need to scream and jump and down &mdash; jump up and down like everybody else." Is that really what you want? What we just saw? I don't think so.And you know, I &mdash; when I got into this race, I decided to look under the hood of the engine of what runs Washington, D.C., and my first inclination was to run away, but I didn't do it because I'm thinking about our children and the fact that we are the United States of America. And anybody up here is going to be much better than what's going to come on the other side. And what happened tonight with &mdash; with Justice Scalia tells you that we cannot afford to lose this election, and we cannot be tearing each other down. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~And, as far as Medicare and Medicaid, my main goal is to get rid of Obamacare and put the care back in the hands of [inaudible]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Before you ask the question, can I respond to the &mdash; you know, they mentioned my name a couple of times.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~No, it isn't. First of all, let me go back to your first question for me. It wasn't phrased as who gets to nominate Supreme Court appointees. Of course that's the president. So I know that there are some left-wing media who would try to make hay on that.Secondly, thank you for including me in the debate. Two questions already. This is great. Now, as far [laughter and applause] as far as those 2 a.m. phone calls are concerned, judgment is what is required. And the kinds of things that you come up with are sometimes very, very difficult and very unique. One of the things that I was known for is doing things that have not been done before. So no amount of experience really prepares you to do something that has never been done before. That's where judgment comes in.And that, I think, is a situation that we're in right now, a situation that we have never been in before with the kinds of threats that pose real danger to our nation, and it comes in very handy in those situations.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~This is the first generation not expected to do better than their parents. Some people say it's the new normal, but there's nothing normal about it in an exceptional American. I, like you, am a member of we, the people, and we know that our country is heading off the cliff.Joseph Stalin said if you want to bring America down you, have to undermine three things: our spiritual life, our patriotism and our morality. We, the people, can stop that decline, starting right here in South Carolina. If all the people who say, "I love Ben Carson and his policies, but he can't win," vote for me, not only can we win, but we can turn this thing around.You know, we have this manipulation by the political class and by the media telling us who we're supposed to pick and how we're supposed to live. We, the people, are the only people who will determine that. And if you elect me as your next president, I promise you that you will get somebody who is accountable to everybody and beholden to no one. Thank you. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Well, first of all, I'm not a politician, so I'm never going to become a politician. But here's what &mdash; here's what people need to know. People need to know that free college is not &mdash; it's a non-starter. You know, you have to look at our economic situation. We're on the verge of economic collapse and, you know, we're &mdash; it's not just the $19 trillion, but it's also the $200 trillion in unfunded liabilities.What we need to think about is, what does that do to the average person? When we have a debt of that nature, it causes the Fed to change their policy, it causes the central bank to keep the &mdash; the rates low, and who does does that affect? Mr. Average, who used to go to the bank every Friday and put part of his check in the bank and watch it grow over three decades and be able to retire with a nice nest egg, that's gone. That part of the American dream is gone.All of these things are disappearing, and Bernie Sanders and people like Hillary Clinton blame it on the rich. They say those evil rich people, if we take their money we can solve the problem. It's not the evil rich people. It's the irresponsible, evil government. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Well, first of all, let me just address the Iraq question.You know, I was not particularly in favor of us going to war in Iraq, primarily because I have studied, you know, the Middle East, recognizing that those are nations that are ruled by dictators and have been for thousands of years. And when you go in and you remove one of those dictators, unless you have an appropriate plan for replacing them, you're going to have chaos.Now, fortunately, we were able to stabilize the situation, and it was the current administration that turned tail and ran and destabilized the situation. [applause]Now, having said that, in terms of the rules of engagement, I was talking about, you know, Obama has said, you know, we shouldn't bomb tankers, you know, coming out of refineries because there may be people in there, or because the environment may be hurt.You know, that's just asinine thinking. And the fact of the matter is [applause]You know, we &mdash; obviously, you're not going to accomplish all of your goals without some collateral damage. You have to be able to assess what is acceptable and what is not.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Well, first of all, let me just mention on the tax issue. Bencarson.com, go read about it, because my tax plan has been praised by Cato, by Wall Street Journal. Forbes said it is the best, the most pro-growth tax plan, and it's based on real fairness for everybody. Starts at the 150 percent poverty level, but even the people below that have to pay something, because everybody has to have skin in the game, and the millions of people can't, you know, talk about what other people have to pay and have no skin in the game.And it deals with corporate tax rate, and makes it the same as everybody else [bell rings] everybody pays exactly the same.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Well, first of all, please go to my website, bencarson.com, and read my immigration policy, O.K.? Because it actually makes sense.Now, the &mdash; as far as these fines are concerned, you know? Here's the big problem. We've got all these government regulators, and all they're doing is running around looking for people to fine. And we've got 645 different federal agencies and sub-agencies. Way, way too many, and they don't have anything else to do.I think what we really need to do is start trimming the regulatory agencies rather than going after the people who are trying to increase the viability, economic viability of our society. Now, that doesn't mean there aren't some people out there who are doing bad things. But I'm not sure that the way to solve that problem is by increasing all the regulatory burden. You know, when you consider how much regulations cost us each year, you know? $2 trillion dollars per family, $24,000 per family, that happens to be the same level as the poverty level [bell rings]  for a family of four. If you want to get rid of poverty, get rid of all the regulations.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Well, the current Constitution actually doesn't address that particular situation, but the fact of the matter is the Supreme Court, obviously, is a very important part of our governmental system. And when our Constitution was put in place, the average age of death was under 50, and therefore the whole concept of lifetime appointments for Supreme Court judges and federal judges was not considered to be a big deal.Obviously, that has changed, and it's something that probably needs to be looked at pretty carefully at some point. But, we need to start thinking about the divisiveness that is going on in our country. I looked at some of the remarks that people made after finding out that Justice Scalia had died, and they were truly nasty remarks. And that we have managed to get to that position in our country is truly a shame. And we should be thinking about how we could create some healing in this land.But, right now, we're not going to get healing with President Obama. That's very United Nations clear. So, I [bell rings]  fully agree that we should not allow a judge to be appointed during his time.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~[inaudible] called me a genius, I like him so far, I have to tell you. Let me just tell you this.Jeb is so wrong. Jeb is absolutely self &mdash; just so you understand, you know what that is? That's Jeb's special interest and lobbyist talking.Look, let me just tell you something, Jeb &mdash; Jeb is so wrong. You got to fight ISIS first. You fight ISIS first. Right now you have Russia, you have Iran, you have them with Assad, and you have them with Syria. You have to knock out ISIS. They're chopping off heads. These are animals. You have to knock 'em out. You have to knock them off strong. You decide what to do after, you can't fight two wars at one time.If you listen to him, and you listen to some of the folks that I've been listening to, that's why we've been in the Middle East for 15 years, and we haven't won anything. We've spent $5 trillion dollars in the Middle East with thinking like that. We've spent $5 [bell rings] Lindsey Graham, who backs him, had zero on his polls. Let me just say something &mdash; we've spent &mdash; we've spent.I only tell the truth, lobbyists.We've spent $5 trillion dollars all over the &mdash; we have to rebuild our country. We have to rebuild our infrastructure. You listen to that, you're going to be there for another 15
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~[inaudible]. I don't know what you're talking about.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~44 million &mdash; give me a break.[crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Again, where did I support it?
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~And George Bush &mdash; by the way, George Bush had the chance, also, and he didn't listen to the advice of his C.I.A.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~And you haven't &mdash; excuse me, you haven't heard that. You listen to the good record in Florida. You take a look at what happened, as soon as that year ended he got out, Florida crashed. Too much debt.He loaded it up with debt, and his spending went through the roof.[crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Because you have tremendous waste. I'll tell you
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~But not when it comes to abortion.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~By the way
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Excuse me, Jeb!
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Excuse me. Excuse me, there are wonderful things having to do with women's health.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~First of all, I have to say, as a businessman, I get along with everybody. I have business all over the world. [booing]I know so many of the people in the audience. And by the way, I'm a self-funder. I don't have &mdash; I have my wife and I have my son. That's all I have. I don't have this. [applause]So let me just tell you, I get along with everybody, which is my obligation to my company, to myself, et cetera.Obviously, the war in Iraq was a big, fat mistake. All right? Now, you can take it any way you want, and it took &mdash; it took Jeb Bush, if you remember at the beginning of his announcement, when he announced for president, it took him five days.He went back, it was a mistake, it wasn't a mistake. It took him five days before his people told him what to say, and he ultimately said, "It was a mistake." The war in Iraq, we spent $2 trillion, thousands of lives, we don't even have it. Iran has taken over Iraq, with the second-largest oil reserves in the world.Obviously, it was a mistake.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~First of all, the &mdash; when you say I'm the only candidate, if you listen to the Democrats, they want to do many things to Social Security, and I want to do them on its own merit. You listen to them, what they want to do to Social Security, none of these folks are getting elected, O.K., whether they can do it or not. I'm going to save Social Security. I'm going to bring jobs back from China. I'm going to bring jobs back from Mexico and from Japan, where they're all &mdash; every country throughout the world &mdash; now Vietnam, that's the new one.They are taking our jobs. They are taking our wealth. They are taking our base. And you and I have had this discussion. We're going to make our economy strong again. I'm lowering taxes. We have $2.5 trillion offshore. We have 2.5 trillion that I think is actually five trillion because the government has no idea when they say 2.5, they have no idea what they're doing or saying, as they've proven very well.We're going to bring that money back. You take a look at what happened just this week. China bought the Chicago Stock Exchange, China, a Chinese company. Carrier is moving to Mexico, air conditioning company. Not only the ones I talk about all the time, Nabisco and Ford and &mdash; they're all moving out.We have an economy that last quarter, G.D.P. didn't grow. It was flat. We have to make our economy grow again. We're dying. This country is dying. And our workers are losing their jobs, and you're going
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Florida went down the tubes right after he got out of office.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~George Bush made a mistake. We can make mistakes. But that one was a beauty. We should have never been in Iraq. We have destabilized the Middle East.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~He's a nasty guy.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~He also said about language
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~He spent $22 million in [crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~he was not a good governor.

Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Hold on
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~How did he keep us safe when the World Trade Center &mdash; the World &mdash; excuse me. I lost hundreds of friends. The World Trade Center came down during the reign of George Bush. He kept us safe? That is not safe. That is not safe, Marco. That is not safe.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~I'm being nice.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~I'm the only one who is going to save Social Security, believe me.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~I don't want to go. [laughter]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~I never called him &mdash; I don't call him..
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~I never went bankrupt, never.Now &mdash; but you don't want to say that. Now, let me just say, I've used it, just like the biggest leaders in the country. Let me tell you something &mdash; Florida. Florida, he put so much debt on Florida. You know, we keep saying he's a wonderful governor, wonderful governor. He put so much debt on Florida, and he increased spending so much that as soon as he got out of office, Florida crashed.I happened to be there. It's my second home. Florida crashed. He didn't do a good job as governor.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~I think he's going to do it whether or I'm O.K. with it or not. I think it's up to Mitch McConnell and everybody else to stop it. It's called delay, delay, delay. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~I want everybody taken care of, but we have to take care of our people in this country. We're not taking care of our people. We have no border. We have no control. People are flooding across. We can't have it. We either have a border, and I'm very strongly &mdash; I'm not proposing. I will build a wall. I will build a wall.Remember this, the wall will be paid for by Mexico. We are not being treated right. [applause]We are not being treated properly. If we don't have borders, if we don't have strength, we don't have a country. People are flowing across. We have to take care of our people. Believe me.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~I would build consensus with Congress, and Congress would agree with me. I'll give you an example, because I don't like the idea of using executive orders like our president. It is a disaster what he's doing. I would build consensus, but consensus means you have to work hard. You have to cajole. You have to get them into the Oval Office and get them all together, and you have to make deals.Let me just tell you, I mentioned before, China &mdash; big Chinese company bought the Chicago Exchange. Kerry is moving &mdash; and if you saw the people, because they have a video of the announcement that Carrier is moving to Mexico, O.K.?Well, I'll tell you what. I would go right now to Carrier and I would say I am going to work awfully hard. You're going to make air conditioners now in Mexico. You're going to get all of these 1,400 people that are being laid off &mdash; they're laid off. They were crying. They were &mdash; it was a very sad situation. You're going to go to Mexico. You're going to make air conditioners in Mexico, you're going to put them across our border with no tax.I'm going to tell them right now, I am going to get consensus from Congress and we're going to tax you when those air conditioners come. So stay where you are or build in the United States, because we are killing ourselves with trade pacts that are no good for us and no good for our workers. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~It does do wonderful things, but not as it relates to abortion.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~John, in life you have flexibility. You do have flexibility. When you're fighting wars, you're going one way, you have a plan. It's a beautiful plan. It can't lose. The enemy makes a change, and all of a sudden you have to change.You have to have flexibility. In Ronald Reagan, though, in terms of what we're talking about, was the great example. He was a somewhat liberal Democrat who became a somewhat, pretty strong conservative. He became &mdash; most importantly, he became a great president. He made many of the changes that I've made &mdash; I mean, I've seen as I grew up, I've seen, and as I get older and wiser, and I feel that I am a conservative.Now, I also feel I'm a common-sense conservative, because some of the views I don't agree with. And I think a lot of people agree with me, obviously, based on what's happening.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Language. Two days ago he said he would take his pants off and moon everybody, and that's fine. Nobody reports that. He gets up and says that, and then he tells me, oh, my language was a little bit rough

Jeb goes around saying, just like the biggest business leaders in this country, I've used the laws of the land to chapter &mdash; I bought a company, I threw it immediately into a chapter, I made a great deal. I uses the laws to my benefit, because I run a company.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Look [applause] When I announced that I was running for president on June 16th, illegal immigration wasn't even a subject. If I didn't bring it up, we wouldn't even be talking. Now, I don't often agree with Marco, and I don't often agree with Ted, but I can in this case. The weakest person on this stage by far on illegal immigration is Jeb Bush. They come out of an act of love, whether you like it or not. He is so weak on illegal immigration it's laughable, and everybody knows it.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~My language. Give me a break
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~No, but it's another lie.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~No, but it's another lie. This guy doesn't know what he's talking about. Just a lie.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~O.K., governor.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Oh, let me just say &mdash; look, I am very open &mdash; I hired top people. I've had great success. I built a great, great company. I don't need to do this. I'm self-funding. I'm spending a lot of money. I've spent &mdash; like in New Hampshire, I spent $3 million. Jeb bush spent $44 million. He came in five, and I came in No. 1.That's what the country needs, folks. I spent 3, he spends 42 of their money, of special interest money. And it's just &mdash; this is not going to make &mdash; excuse me. This is not going to make our country great again.This is not what we need in our country. We need people that know what the hell they're doing. And politicians, they're all talk, they're no action. And that's why people are supporting me.I do listen to people. I hire experts. I hire top, top people. And I do listen. And you know what? Sometimes they're wrong. You have to know what to do, when to do it. But sometimes they're wrong.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Oh, yeah, yeah
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Or a tax.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~She should be running.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Spend a little more money on the commercials
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Take a look at your numbers.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Ted Cruz told your brother that he wanted John Roberts to be on the United States Supreme Court. They both pushed him, he twice approved Obamacare.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Thank you very much, I appreciate it.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Thank you.Politicians are all talk, no action. You've seen where they've take you to. We are 19 trillion dollars right now. It's going to be increased with that horrible budget from a month ago that was just approved by politicians.We need a change. We need a very big change. We're going to make our country great again.I say this every night, every day, every afternoon, and it's so true &mdash; we don't win anymore. We don't win with health care, we don't win with ISIS and the military, we don't take care of our vets, we don't care of our borders, we don't win. We are going to start winning again. We are not going to be controlled by people that are special interests and lobbyists that everybody here has contributed to. And you know what, they do exactly what those folks want them to do.We are going to make our country great, and we're going to do the right thing. I'm working for you. I'm not working for anybody else.Thank you very much.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~That's a lot of lies.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~That's not &mdash; let me respond. That's another lie. I never went bankrupt![crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~That's not keeping us safe.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~that we don't even know who they are.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~The World Trade Center came down during your brother's reign, remember that. [booing]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~We're supporting troops
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~We're supporting troops that we don't even know who they are
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~We have no idea who they are.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Well, I'll tell you &mdash; over the years, I've made many speeches. People have asked me, big companies have asked me to make speeches, and friends of mine that run big companies on success.And occasion, in order to sort of really highlight something, I'll use a profanity. One of the profanities that I got credited with using, that I didn't use, was a very bad word, two weeks ago, that I never used.I said, "You." And everybody said "Oh, he didn't say anything wrong." But you bleeped it, so everyone thinks I said the &mdash; I didn't say anything. I never said the word.It is very unfair, that criticism. Now, I will say this, with all of that being said, I have said I will not do it at all, because if I say a word that's a little bit off color, a little bit, it ends up being a headline.I will not do it again. I was a very good student at a great school not using &mdash; by the way &mdash; not using profanity is very easy.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Well, I can say this. If the president, and if I were president now, I would certainly want to try and nominate a justice. I'm sure that, frankly, I'm absolutely sure that President Obama will try and do it. I hope that our Senate is going to be able &mdash; Mitch, and the entire group, is going to be able to do something about it.In times of delay, we could have a Diane Sykes, or you could have a Bill Pryor &mdash; we have some fantastic people. But this is a tremendous blow to conservatism. It's a tremendous blow, frankly, to our country.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Well, I think these people always hit me with eminent domain, and frankly, I'm not in love with eminent domain. But eminent domain is something you need very strongly.When Jeb had said, "You used eminent domain privately for a parking lot." It wasn't for a parking lot. The state of New Jersey &mdash; too bad Chris Christie is not here, he could tell you &mdash; the state of New Jersey went to build a very large tower that was going to employ thousands of people.I mean, it was going to really do a big job in terms of economic development. Now, just so you understand, I got hit very hard. It's private, it's private eminent domain. You understand that they took over a stadium in Texas, and they used private eminent domain, but he just found that out after he made the charge.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Well, I would say my wife tells me I'm wrong all the time. And I listen. [laughter]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Went right down because of what he did to it.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~What we want to do, when we want to do it, and how hard do we want to hit? Because we are going to have to hit very, very hard to knock out ISIS.We're going to also have to learn who our allies are. We have allies, so-called allies, we're spending billions and billions of dollars supporting people &mdash; we have no idea who they are in Syria. Do we want to stay that route, or do we want to go and make something with Russia?I hate to say Iran, but with Russia, because we &mdash; and the Iran deal is one of the worst deals I have ever seen negotiated in my entire life. It's a disgrace that this country negotiated that deal. But very important [applause]Not only a disgrace, it's a disgrace and an embarrassment. But very important, who are we fighting with? Who are we fighting for? What are we doing? We have to rebuild our country. But we have to &mdash; I'm the only one on this stage that said: "Do not go into Iraq. Do not attack Iraq." Nobody else on this stage said that. And I said it loud and strong. And I was in the private sector. I wasn't a politician, fortunately.But I said it, and I said it loud and clear, "You'll destabilize the Middle East." That's exactly what happened.I also said, by the way, four years ago, three years ago, attack the oil, take the wealth away, attack the oil and keep the oil. They didn't listen. They just started that a few months ago. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Where did I support it? Where did I
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Where did I support?
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Why do you lie?
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Yeah, yeah, I know, you're an adult.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Yeah. Well, Jeb wouldn't have known about it.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Yes.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~You'll end up with World War III
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~You did say it, you did say it. Been reported in 10 different news
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~You do whatever you want. You call it whatever you want. I want to tell you. They lied. They said there were weapons of mass destruction, there were none. And they knew there were none. There were no weapons of mass destruction. [booing]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~You have tremendous waste, fraud and abuse. That we're taking care of. That we're taking care of. It's tremendous. We have in Social Security right now thousands and thousands of people that are over 106 years old. Now, you know they don't exist. They don't exist. There's tremendous waste, fraud and abuse, and we're going to get it. But we're not going to hurt the people who have been paying into Social Security their whole life and then all of a sudden they're supposed to get less. We're bringing our jobs back. We're going to make our economy great again.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~You probably are worse than Jeb Bush. You are single biggest liar. This guy's lied &mdash; let me just tell you, this guy lied about Ben Carson when he took votes away from Ben Carson in Iowa, and he just continues. Today, we had robo-calls saying, "Donald Trump is not going to run in South Carolina," where I'm leading by a lot.I'm not going to vote for Ted Cruz. This is the same thing he did to Ben Carson. This guy will say anything, nasty guy. Now I know why he doesn't have one endorsement from any of his colleagues.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~You pushed him.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~You pushed him. You pushed him.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~You shouldn't have used it then, Jeb.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~You worked with him and you pushed him. Why do you lie?
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~[inaudible] Just, for the record [inaudible] make sure my mother's listening, if she's watching the debate. I didn't say that I was going to moon somebody
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Also, he talked about one of my heroes, Ronald Reagan.Ronald Reagan was a liberal maybe in the 1950s. He was a conservative reformed governor for eight years before he became president, and no one should suggest he made an evolution for political purposes. He was a conservative, and he didn't tear down people like Donald Trump is. He tore down the Berlin Wall.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~And Governor Haley is ranked at the top.[crosstalk]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~But, if you want to talk about weakness, you want to talk about weakness? It's weak to disparage women. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Can I just
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Do I get to do it five or six times or just once, responding to that?
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Great question. I feel like I have to get into my inner Chris Christie, and point out that the reason why I should be president is listening to two senators talk about arcane amendments to bills that didn't pass. [applause]This is &mdash; this is the problem. We need a leader to fix this problem. And I have a detailed plan to do just that, including controlling the border, dealing with the visa over-stayers, making sure that we have a path to legal status, not to citizenship, for those that come out from the shadows and pay a fine, learn English, don't commit crimes, work and pay taxes.That is the better approach.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~half of that.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~He called me a liar.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~He has had the gall to go after my mother.Hold on. Let me finish. He has had the gall to go after my mother.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~He was a great guy. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Here's the record. Here's the record. We led the nation in job growth seven out of eight years. When I left there was $9 billion of reserves, 35 percent of general revenue. No state came close to that.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Here we go.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~I'd like &mdash; can I &mdash; can I
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~I'm not going to invite Donald Trump to the rally in Charleston on Monday afternoon when my brother is coming to speak.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~I'm rescinding the invitation. I thought you might want to come, but I guess not.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~I've got about five or six
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~I am sick and tired of him going after my family. My dad is the greatest man alive in my mind. [applause] And while Donald Trump was building a reality TV show, my brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe. And I'm proud of what he did. [applause]And he has had the gall to go after my brother.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~I think it's my turn, isn't it?
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~I think the dysfunction in Washington is really dangerous, that's what I think. And we need a proven leader that has a record of solving problems, someone who doesn't cut and run; someone who could be a commander in chief to unite our country around common purposes; someone who doesn't disparage people.Someone that doesn't brag, for example, that he has been bankrupt four times and it was great, because he could use the legal system.Someone
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~It's very different. Transmission lines, pipe lines, bridges and highways. All of that is proper use of imminent domain. Not to take an elderly woman's home to build a parking lot so that high-rollers can come from New York City to build casinos in Atlantic City.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~It's weak to denigrate the disabled. And,it's really weak to call John McCain a loser because he was a
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Let me finish
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Let me finish, though. No, no, no &mdash; hey, wait, wait, wait. Just hold, Major, hold, Major. Hold on, Major.[crosstalk]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Look, I admire the fact that Governor Kasich is supporting spending more money on drug treatment and mental health. I think that's a high priority all across this country, but expanding Obamacare is what we're talking about, and Obamacare's expansion, even though the federal government is paying for the great majority of it, is creating further debt on the backs of our children and grandchildren. We should be fighting Obamacare, repealing Obamacare, replacing it with something totally different. [applause]When I was &mdash; as a private citizen, Florida was confronted with the choice. The governor was supportive of doing what John did. So was the Florida Senate. A committed speaker of the House asked me to go as a private citizen to make the case against the expansion.I did, and it wasn't expanded there, just as it wasn't expanded in South Carolina under Governor Haley.[crosstalk]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Look, I won the lottery when I was born 63 years ago, looked up, and I saw my mom. My mom is the strongest woman I know.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~My name was mentioned twice.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~No, it doesn't, and that's the problem. The lack of leadership in this country by Barack Obama, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, thinking that this is a policy that works, this policy of containment with ISIS. It's a complete, unmitigated disaster. And to allow Russia now to have influence in Syria makes it harder, but we need to destroy ISIS and dispose of Assad to create a stable Syria so that the four million refugees aren't a breeding ground for Islamic jihadists.This is the problem. Donald Trump brought up the fact that he would &mdash; he'd want to accommodate Russia. Russia is not taking out ISIS. They're &mdash; they're attacking our &mdash; our &mdash; our team, the team that we've been training and the team that we've been supporting. It is absolutely ludicrous to suggest that Russia could be a positive partner in this. They are on the run. They are making &mdash; every time we step back, they're on the run. The question that you asked was a really good one about what you would do &mdash; what three things would you do.I would restore the military, the sequester needs to be reversed. I would have a strategy to destroy ISIS, and I would immediately create a policy of containment as it relates to Iran's ambitions, and to make it make clear that we are not going to allow for Iran to do what it's doing, which is to move towards a nuclear weapon.Those three things would be the first and foremost things that we need to do [bell rings]  in 2017.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~No. He mentioned my name.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Not on specific issues, not at all. I think the next president &mdash; if I'm president, I will appoint people &mdash; I'll nominate people that have a proven record in the judiciary.The problem in the past has been we have appointed people thinking you can get it through the Senate because they didn't have a record. And the problem is that sometimes we're surprised.The simple fact is the next president needs to appoint someone with a proven conservative record, similar to Justice Scalia, that is a lover of liberty, that believes in limited government, that consistently applied that kind of philosophy, that didn't try to legislator from the bench, that was respectful of the Constitution.And then fight and fight, and fight for that nomination to make sure that that nomination passes.Of course, the president, by the way, has every right to nominate Supreme Court justices. I'm an Article II guy in the Constitution. We're running for the president of the United States. We want a strong executive for sure. But in return for that, there should be a consensus orientation on that nomination, and there's no doubt in my mind that Barack Obama will not have a consensus pick when he submits that person to the Senate.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Of course not. It won't have an impact on hedge funds managers paying ordinary income. In fact, it's not just hedge fund people, but people that are doing &mdash; they're in the business of investing other people's money, getting capital gains treatment is not appropriate.They should be paying ordinary income. That's their business. They're grateful to be able to make a lot of money, I'm sure. And what we do is lower the rates. It's not the end of the world that private equity people and hedge fund folks that are, right now, getting capital gains treatment for the income they earn, pay ordinary income like everybody else in this room. That's not a problem at all. What we need to do is reform the tax code to simplify the rates, to shift power away from Washington, D.C. That's what I did as governor of the state of Florida, $19 billion dollars of tax cuts, and it stimulated seven out of the eight years. Florida led the nation in job growth. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Or you could ask me two questions, so I could get two minutes instead of one.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Right.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~So here's the deal. I'm sick and tired of Barack Obama blaming my brother for all of the problems that he has had. [applause] And, frankly, I could care less about the insults that Donald Trump gives to me. It's blood sport for him. He enjoys it. And I'm glad he's happy about it. But I am sick and tired
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~So, there &mdash; so, there is all sorts of intrigue about where I disagree with my brother, there would be one right there. You should not use eminent domain for private purposes.A baseball stadium or a parking lot for a limo  [laughter]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~So, you know [bell rings] This is the standard operating procedure, to disparage me. That's fine
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Sounds like a good plan.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~South Carolina &mdash; South Carolinians need to know this, because the Cato Institute, which grades governors based on their spending, rank him right at the bottom.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~South Carolinians want to make that, they elect the most conservative governor or candidate that can win.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Thank you all very much. The next president is going to be confronted with an unforeseen challenge. That's almost certain. It could be a pandemic, a major natural disaster or an attack on our country. The question for South Carolinians and Americans is who do you want to have sitting behind the big desk in the Oval Office? Because that's the question. It's not the things we're talking about today. It's the great challenge that may happen. I believe I will have a steady hand as commander in chief and president of the United States. I will unite this country around common purposes because I did it as governor of the state of Florida.When I was governor, we had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms in 16 months. Our state was on its back. We recovered far faster than what people thought because we led.We want to challenge rather than cutting and running. That's what we need in Washington, D.C. We need someone with a servant's heart that has a backbone, that isn't going to focus on polls and focus groups. The focus will be on the American people to keep them safe and secure.I ask for your vote next Saturday. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Thank you.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~That is outrageous. The guy's an American hero. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~That was me.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~The government grew by
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~The great majority of people that come to this country come because they have no other choice. They want to come to provide for their families. That doesn't mean it's right. That doesn't mean it's right.We should pick who comes to our country. We should control our border. Coming here legally should be a lot easier than coming here illegally. But the motivation, they're not all rapists, as you-know-who said. They're not that.These are people that are coming to provide for their families. And we should show a little more respect for the fact that they're struggling. It doesn't mean we shouldn't be controlling the border. That's exactly what we should be doing.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~The simple fact is I've also laid out my plans on [inaudible] immigration
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~The very basic fact is that Vladimir Putin is not going to be an ally of the United States. The whole world knows this. It's a simple, basic fact. [applause]They're not taking out &mdash; they're not even attempting to take out ISIS. They're attacking the troops that we're supporting. We need to create a coalition, Sunni-led coalition on the ground with our special operators to destroy ISIS and bring about stability. And you can't do that with Assad in power. He has
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~This is a guy who thinks that Hillary Clinton is a great negotiator in Iran
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~This is a man who insults his way to the nomination
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~This is coming from a guy who gets his foreign policy from the shows.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~This is not about my family or his family. This is about the South Carolina families that need someone to be a commander in chief that can lead. I'm that person.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~This is ridiculous
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~We need someone with a proven record to be able to forge consensus to solve problems.And right now, both Republicans and Democrats in Washington don't get it. People are struggling &mdash; 63 percent of Americans can't make a $500 car payment. Most Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. And we need someone has a proven record of growing the economy, reforming the things that are broken.And I'm that person.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~When I &mdash; during my time, we were one of the two states to go to AAA bond rating. We didn't go bankrupt like Trump did and call it success when people are laid off, when vendors don't get paid. That's not success.What we did was create an environment where people had a chance to have income. Personal income during my time went up by 4.4 percent.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Yeah
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Yeah, well, I have got to respond to this.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Yeah.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Yes.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~[off mike] [inaudible] First of all, I'm for sealing the border, O.K.? And then I'm for a guest worker program. People can come in, work and go back home. We haven't closed the border because special interests, I believe, blocked it. Then, we have 11 and a half million people here. If they have not committed a crime since they've been here, make them pay a fine and some back taxes, and give them a path to legalization, never to citizenship.It is not going to happen that we're going to run around and try to drag 11 and a half million people out of their homes.I'll tell you this. Within the first hundred days, I will send a plan like this to the Congress of the United States, and if I'm president, I'll bet you dollar to doughnuts right now, it will pass.[bell rings]That is a reasonable proposal that the people of this country, in my judgment, will support, and so will the bulk of the Congress of the United States. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~And I'm going to stay positive about what I want to do from the  [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Before I get to that, this is the ninth or 10th debate. What I've been watching here, this back and forth, and these attacks, some of them are personal. I think we're fixing to lose the election to Hillary Clinton if we don't stop this. [applause]I mean, the fact is &mdash; you know what? I would suggest, why don't we take off all the negative ads and all the negative comments down from television and let us just talk about what we're for, and let's sell that, and the Republican Party will be stronger as a result
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~First of all &mdash; yes. First of all, look, we have to make it clear to Russia what we expect. We don't have to declare an enemy, rattle a sword or threaten, but we need to make it clear what we expect. No. 1 is we will arm the folks in Ukraine who are fighting for their freedom. They deserve it. There will be no ifs, ands or buts about it.Secondly, an attack on NATO, trumped up on any excuse of Russian-speaking people, either in the NATO countries or in Finland or Sweden, is going to be an attack on us. And look, I think we have an opportunity as America to put something really great together again.The Egyptians, the Saudis, the Jordanians, the Gulf states, they all know they're at risk. We need to look into Europe, we look at France, we look at Germany and the migrants. We look at Belgium, we look at Britain. Everybody now is being threatened by radical Islam. We have an opportunity to lead.You know, the fact of the matter is the world is desperate for our leadership. Sometimes they may &mdash; they may make a remark here or there that we don't like, but frankly, the world needs us. And we have an opportunity now to assemble a coalition of the civilized people, those who respect civilization, the rights of women, the rights to protest, to be able to reassert our leadership all across this globe again and make sure this century is going to be the best we've ever seen.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~I've got to tell you, this is just crazy, huh? [laughter] This is just nuts, O.K.? Jeez, oh, man. I'm sorry, John.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Let me &mdash; let's tell you
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Look, the bottom line is the people of this &mdash; of this country and this state want to see everybody rise, and they want to see unity, and I don't want to get into all this fighting tonight, because people are frankly sick of the negative campaigning.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Major &mdash; Major, we can't &mdash; we've got to &mdash; look, I have got to correct the record. And the fact of the matter is, we went from an $8 billion hole to a $2 billion surplus. We're up 400,000 jobs. Our credit is rock solid.And I don't know
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Oh, well, listen, I think being in Iraq, look, we thought there were weapons of mass destruction. Colin Powell, who is one of the most distinguished generals in modern time, said there were weapons there. [applause]But, but, the fact is we got ourselves in the middle of a civil war. The Sunni, the Shia and the Kurds, never gotten along. In fact, that country was drawn &mdash; the borders of that country were drawn after World War I by Westerners that didn't understand what was happening there. The tragedy of it is that we're still embroiled. And, frankly, if there weren't weapons of mass destruction, we should never have gone. I don't believe the United States should involve itself in civil wars. Civil wars are not in our direct interest, and if you &mdash; and look, I served on a defense committee for 18 years and was called into the Pentagon after 9/11 by Secretary Rumsfeld to deal with some of the most serious problems that we faced.The fact is, is that we should go to war when it is our direct interest. We should not be policemen of the world, but when we go, we mean business. We'll do our job. We'll tell our soldiers, our people in the service, take care of your job and then come home once we've accomplished our goals.That's what we need to do.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~That's what we're doing in our state.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Well, I want to thank the people of South Carolina. You've been fantastic. And look, what I want you to know is I'm going to send a lot of power, money and influence back to where we all live. But as I've traveled around South Carolina, I've noticed something. You know, it's that people have a sense that you're not going to wait on a president. You know, when I was a kid, we didn't wait on presidents to come to that little blue-collar town and fix things.You know, the Lord made all of us special. The Lord wants us to be connected. I believe we're part of a very big mosaic. And I'll send the power back. And whoever gets elected president here, hopefully will take care of the issue of jobs and wages and Social Security and the border.But the spirit of the America rests in all of us. It's in our guts. It's taking care of our children. It's taking care of the lady next door who just lost her husband. It's fixing the schools where we live and telling kids to stay off drugs. You see, I think what the Lord wants is for to us engage, and in America, the spirit of America doesn't come from the top down. The spirit of America rests in us. And I want to call on everyone in America to double down and realize that you were made special to heal this country and lift it for everyone.Thank you all very much. And I hope I can have your vote in South Carolina. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Well, John, first of all, if I were president, we wouldn't have the divisions in the country we have today. I do want to take a second as we reflected on Judge Scalia, it's amazing &mdash; it's not even two minutes after the death of Judge Scalia, nine children here today, their father didn't wake up. His wife, sad, but I just wish we hadn't run so fast into politics.Here's my concern about this. The country is so divided right now, and now we're going to see another partisan fight take place. I really wish the president would think about not nominating somebody. If you were to nominate somebody, let's have him pick somebody that's going to have unanimous approval, and such widespread approval across the country that this could happen without a lot of recrimination. I don't think that's going to happen, and I would like the president just to, for once here, put the country first. We're going to have an election for president very soon, and the people will understand what is at stake in that election.And so I believe the president should not move forward, and I think that we ought to let the next president of the United States decide who is going to run that Supreme Court with a vote by the people of the United [bell rings] States of America. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Yeah, let me say a couple of things.First of all, when Jeb was governor, his first four years as governor, he expand &mdash; his Medicaid program grew twice as fast as mine. O.K.? It's just a fact.Now, with Obamacare, I've not only sued the administration, I did not set up an exchange. And he knows that I'm not for Obamacare, never have been. But here's what's interesting about Medicaid.You know who expanded Medicaid five times to try to help the folks and give them opportunity so that you could rise and get a job? President Ronald Reagan.Now, the fact of the matter is, we expanded to get people on their feet, and once they're on their feet, we are giving them the training and the efforts that they need to be able to get work and pull out of that situation.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Yeah. Well, first of all, those numbers, incorrect. We are &mdash; our Medicaid programs are coming in below cost estimates, and our Medicaid program in the second year grew at 2.5 percent.And Kimberley, let me tell you, when we expand Medicaid and we treat the mentally ill, then they don't live under a bridge or live in a prison, where they cost $22,500 a year.When we take the drug addicted and we treat them in the prisons, we stop the revolving door of people in and out of prisons, and we save $22,500 a year.Guess what else? They get their lives back. And the working poor, they're now getting health care. And you know that about a third of the people who are now getting that health care are people who are suffering very serious illnesses, particularly cancer.So, what I would tell you is, we've gone from an $8 billion hole to a $2 billion surplus. We've cut taxes by more than any governor in America by $5 billion. We have grown the number of jobs by 400,000 private-sector jobs since I've been governor.Our credit is strong. Our pensions are strong. And frankly, we leave no one behind. Economic growth is not an end unto itself. We want everyone to rise, and we will make them personally responsible for the help that they get.And that is exactly the program we're driving in Ohio. And, boy, people ought to look at Ohio, because it has got a good formula. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~You know, John, I think all people are the same. Look, I did 106 town halls, and I've been doing them left and right here in South Carolina. The first thing we have to do is grow the economy, and I know the formula because I was chairman in Washington when we balanced the budget and created so many jobs, and the same that we've been able to do in Ohio. You need common-sense regulations so small business can flourish, you need lower taxes both on business and individuals, and you need a fiscal plan to be able to get ourselves in a situation where people can predict a little bit about the future when it comes to the fiscal issues.And when you have that formula, combined with work force that's trained, you can explode the economy and create many jobs. I have done it twice, and I want to go back to Washington and do it again.John, the thing is, is I think that there are people now, these blue-collar Democrats &mdash; my dad was a blue-collar Democrat &mdash; the Democratic Party has left them. When they're arguing about being socialists, they've left &mdash; they have lost those blue-collar Democrats.And you know what I think they get out of me &mdash; is my sense of what they get out of me, and it's embarrassment about campaigns, you brag about yourself.But I think I'm a uniter, I think people sense it. I think they know I have the experience, and that I'm a man that can give people hope and a sense that they have the opportunity rise. And I'll tell you, I love these blue-collar Democrats, because they're going to vote for us come next fall, promise you that. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~and only now does he say [crosstalk]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~I do.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~I had something important.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~I just want to say, at least on behalf of me and my family, I thank God all the time it was George W. Bush in the White House on 9/11 and not Al Gore. [applause]And you can &mdash; I think you can look back in hindsight and say a couple of things, but he kept us safe. And not only did he keep us safe, but no matter what you want to say about weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was in violation of U.N. resolutions, in open violation, and the world wouldn't do anything about it, and George W. Bush enforced what the international community refused to do.And again, he kept us safe, and I am forever grateful to what he did for this country. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~I speak fast. [laughter]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Look, this is a disturbing pattern now, because for a number of weeks now, Ted Cruz has just been telling lies. He lied about Ben Carson in Iowa. [applause]He lies about Planned Parenthood. He lies about marriage. He's lying about all sorts of things. And now he makes things up. The bottom line is this is a campaign and people are watching it. And they see the truth behind all these issues.And here is the truth, Ted Cruz supported legalizing people that were in this country
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~No, I've never &mdash; there has been, for example, today, according to the changes Harry Reid made, appellate judges can now be appointed by a simple majority, but not Supreme Court justices.And I think today you see the wisdom of why we don't want that to change. Because if that were the case and we were not in charge of the Senate, Harry Reid and Barack Obama would ram down our throat a liberal justice, like the ones Barack Obama has imposed on us already.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~No. I think there are three major threats that you want to immediately get on top of. No. 1 is, what are we doing in the Asia-Pacific region, where both North Korea and China pose threats to the national security of the United States.No. 2 is, what are we doing in the Middle East with the combination of the Sunni-Shia conflict driven by the Shia arc that Iran is now trying to establish in the Middle East, also the growing threat of ISIS.And the third is rebuilding and reinvigorating NATO in the European theater, particularly in Central Europe and in Eastern Europe, where Vladimir Putin is now threatening the territory of multiple countries, already controls 20 percent of Georgia and a significant percentage of Ukraine.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~On anything I want?
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Thank you, and thank you for watching tonight.This is a difficult time in our country. Our economy's flat, it's not creating the jobs it once did, and people struggle living paycheck to paycheck. Our culture's in trouble. Wrong is considered right and right is considered wrong.All the things that once held our families together are now under constant assault. And around the world, America's reputation is in decline. Our allies don't trust us, our adversaries don't fear us, Iran captures our sailors and parades them before the world on video.These are difficult times, but 2016 can be a turning point. That's why I'm running for president, and that's why I'm here today to ask you for your vote. If you elect me president, we are going to re-embrace free enterprise so that everyone can go as far as their talent and their work will take them.We are going to be a country that says that "life begins at conception and life is worthy of the protection of our laws." We're going to be a country that says "that marriage is between one man and one woman." We are going to be a country that says, "The constitution and the rights that it talks about do not come from our president, they come from our creator." We are going to be loyal to our allies like Israel, not enemies like Iran. And we will rebuild the U.S. military so no one will there test it.Vote for me. I will unify this party. I will grow it. We will win this election, and we will make the 21st century a new American century. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~That's not accurate.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~The issue of poverty is critical, because for me, poverty is the &mdash; is &mdash; is free enterprise not reaching people. Today, we have antipoverty programs that don't cure poverty. We don't cure poverty in America. Our antipoverty programs have become, in some instances, a way of life, a lifestyle.Now, we do need antipoverty programs, you can't have free enterprise programs without them, but not as a way of life. And so I have a very specific proposal on this and I don't &mdash; in 60 seconds, I can't describe it all, but it basically turns the program over to states. It allows states to design innovative programs that cure poverty, because I think Nikki Haley will do a better job curing poverty than Barack Obama. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~The World Trade Center came down because Bill Clinton didn't kill Osama bin Laden when he had the chance to kill him. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Thirty seconds.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~We're going to have to do this again, O.K.? When that issue was being debated, Ted Cruz, at a committee hearing, very passionately said, I want immigration reform to pass, I want people to be able to come out of the shadows. And he proposed an amendment that would legalized people here.Not only that, he proposed doubling the number of green cards. He proposed a 500 percent increase on guest workers. Now his position is different. Now he is a passionate opponent of all those things.So he either wasn't telling the truth then or he isn't telling the truth now, but to argue he is a purist on immigration is just not true. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Well, because I'm influencing social policy &mdash; this is their money. This is the money of parents. You don't earn the tax credit unless you're working. That's your money, it doesn't belong to government.Here's what I don't understand. If a business takes their money and they invest in the piece of the equipment, they get to write off their taxes. But if a parent takes money that they have earned to work and invests in their children, they don't? This makes no sense.Parenting is the most important job any of us will ever have. Family formation is the most important thing in society. So what my tax plan does, is it does create, especially for working families, an additional Child Tax Credit. So that parents who are working get to keep more of their own money, not the government's money, to invest in their children to go to school, to go to a private school, to buy a new backpack.Let me tell you, if you're a parent that's struggling, then you know that $50 a month is the difference between a new pair of shoes this month or not getting a new pair of shoes for your kids. I'm going to have a tax plan that is pro-family, because the family is the most important institution in society. You cannot have a strong country without strong families. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Well, first of all, I don't know how he knows what I said on Univision, because he doesn't speak Spanish. And second of all, the other point that I would make
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Well, first of all, I think amnesty is the forgiveness of a wrongdoing without consequence and that &mdash; I've never supported that. I do not support that. I think there has to be consequences for violating our immigration laws. What I think is clear about this issue to begin with is we're not going to be able to make progress on illegal immigration until first, illegal immigration is brought under control.You go back to 1986, when they legalized three million people and they promised to secure the border. It didn't happen, and as a result, people have lost trust in the federal government. It is now clear that the only way to make progress on immigration is not just to pass a law that enforces the law, but actually prove to people that it's working.They want to see the wall built. They want to see the additional border agents. They want to see E-Verify. They want to see an entry-exit tracking system. Forty percent of the people in this country illegally are entering legally and overstaying visas. And only after all of that is in place, then we'll see what the American people are willing to support on this issue.I think the American people will be very reasonable, but responsible, about how you handle someone who has been here a long time, who can pass a background check, who pays a fine and starts paying taxes and all they want is a work permit. But you can't do any of that until you prove to people that illegal immigration is under control once and for all. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Well, I think one of the presidents &mdash; well, the president I grew up under was Ronald Reagan. And Reagan had a vision for America's future. And if you think about what Ronald Reagan inherited, it's not unlike what the next president is going to inherit.This is the worst president we've had in 35 years, 35 years back would have made it Jimmy Carter. That's what Ronald Reagan inherited. And I think the question you would ask is, how did you inspire again the American people to believe in the future?How did you &mdash; what did it take to ensure that the American people, despite all of the difficulties of the time &mdash; you know, you look back at that time, the American military was in decline. Our standing in the world was in decline. We had hostages being held in Iran. Our economy was in bad shape.The American people were scared about the future. They were scared about what kind of country their children were going to live in and inherit. And yet somehow Ronald Reagan was able to instill in our nation and in our people a sense of optimism.And he turned America around because of that vision and ultimately because of that leadership. I wish Ronald Reagan was still around. This country needs someone just like that.And if our next president is even half the president Ronald Reagan was, America is going to be greater than it has ever been. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Well, let me first talk about Justice Scalia. His loss is tremendous, and obviously our hearts and prayers go out to his family. He will go down as one of the great justices in the history of this republic.You talk about someone who defended consistently the original meaning of the Constitution, who understood that the Constitution was not there to be interpreted based on the fads of the moment, but it was there to be interpreted according to its original meaning.Justice Scalia understood that better than anyone in the history of this republic. His dissent, for example, on the independent counsel case is a brilliant piece of jurist work. And, of course, his dissent on Obergefell as well.No. 2, I do not believe the president should appoint someone. And it's not unprecedented. In fact, it has been over 80 years since a lame duck president has appointed a Supreme Court justice.And it remind us of this, how important this election is. Someone on this stage will get to choose the balance of the Supreme Court, and it will begin by filling this vacancy that's there now.And we need to put people on the bench that understand that the Constitution is not a living and breathing document. It is to be interpreted as originally meant.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Well, let me talk about poverty.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Well, let me tell you what has happened a couple of years ago. One of the hardest decisions you'll ever make in Congress is when you are asked by the president to authorize the use of force in a conflict, because you are now putting your name, on behalf of the people of your state, behind a military action, where Americans in uniform could lose their life.So, in 2014, Barack Obama said he would not take military action against Assad unless it was authorized by the Senate, beginning on the Committee of Foreign Relations, where I am one of its members. And it was hard because you looked at the pictures. I saw the same images people saw. I'm the father of children. I saw the images of these little children &mdash; been gassed and poisoned by their own leaders, and we were angry. Something had to happen, and there was the sense that we needed to seek retribution.And then I looked at Barack Obama's plan. Barack Obama's plan, which John Kerry later described as unbelievably small, and I concluded that that attack would not only not help the situation, it would make it actually worse. It would allow Assad to stand up to the United States of America, survive a strike, stay in power and actually strengthen his grip.So it was a difficult decision to make, and when we only had a few days to look at and make a decision on it, and I voted against Barack Obama's plan to use force, and it was the right decision.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Well, no. It's not the case. It didn't pass, and we haven't solved immigration in this country. It's still a problem. It is worse today than it was three years ago, which is worse than it was five years ago. And it has to be confronted and solved.But the only way forward on this issue &mdash; you asked a question about flexibility. Let me tell you about that. One of the things that you need in leadership is the ability to understand that to get things done, you must figure out the way to get it done. You will not pass comprehensive immigration reform. People do not trust the federal government.They want to see the law being enforced. They want to see illegal immigration come under control. They want to see that wall. They want to see E-Verify. They want to see all of these things working, and then they will have a conversation with you about what do you do with people that have been here a long time that are otherwise, you know, not criminals. But they're not going to do it until you first enforce the law.

Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Don, the reasoned principle matters.

Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~For most of his life, his policies have been very, very liberal. For most of his life, he has described himself as very pro- choice and as a supporter of partial birth abortion. Right now, today, as a candidate, he supports federal taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood. I disagree with him on that.That's a matter of principle, and I'll tell you
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~He was appointed in
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~I did not nominate him. I would not have nominated him. I would've nominated my former boss Liberman, who was Justice Scalia's first law clerk. And you know how I know that Donald's Supreme Court justices will be liberals? Because his entire life, he support liberals from Jimmy Carter, to Hillary Clinton, to John Kerry.In 2004, he contributed to John Kerry. Nobody who cares about judges would contribute to John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~I did not nominate John Roberts. I would not have nominated John Roberts.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~I supported
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~I think it is a very important question because the people who have been hurt the most in the Obama economy had been the most vulnerable. It's been young people. It's been Hispanics. It's been African-Americans. It's been single moms. We have the lowest percentage of Americans working today in any year since 1977.And the sad reality is big government, massive taxes, massive regulation, doesn't work. What we need to do instead is bring back booming economic growth, let &mdash; small businesses are the heart of the economy. Two-thirds of all new jobs come from small businesses. If we want to lift people out of poverty &mdash; you know, I think of these issues from the perspective of my dad.My dad fled Cuba in 1957. He was just 18. He couldn't speak English. He had nothing. He had $100 in his underwear. And he washed dishes making 50 cents an hour and paid his way through school. Today, my dad is a pastor. He travels the country preaching the gospel.Now, I think about all of these issues. How would it impact my dad when he was washing dishes? If we had Obamacare in place right now, the odds are very high my father would have been laid off, because it's teenaged kids like my dad who have gotten laid off. If he didn't get laid off, the odds are high he would have had his hours forcibly reduced to 28, 29 hours a week.We need to lift the burdens on small businesses so you have jobs, and we need welfare reform that gets people off of welfare and back to work.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~I will say, it is fairly remarkable to see Donald defending Ben after he called, "pathological," and compared him to a child molester. Both of which were offensive and wrong.But let me say this &mdash; you notice Donald didn't disagree with the substance that he supports taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood. And Donald has this weird pattern, when you point to his own record, he screams, "Liar, liar, liar." You want to go

Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Justice Scalia was a legal giant. He was somebody that I knew for 20 years. He was a brilliant man. He was faithful to the Constitution. He changed the arc of American legal history. And I'll tell you, his passing tonight, our prayers are with his family, with his wife, Maureen, who he adored, his nine children, his 36 grandkids. But it underscores the stakes of this election. We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that will strike down every restriction on abortion adopted by the states. We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that will reverse the Heller decision, one of Justice Scalia's seminal decisions, that upheld the Second Amendment right to keep and to bear arms.We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that would undermine the religious liberty of millions of Americans &mdash; and the stakes of this election, for this year, for the Senate, the Senate needs to stand strong and say, "We're not going to give up the U.S. Supreme Court for a generation by allowing Barack Obama to make one more liberal appointee."And then for the state of South Carolina, one of the most important judgments for the men and women of South Carolina to make is who on this stage has the background, the principle, the character, the judgment and the strength of resolve to nominate and confirm principled constitutionalists to the court? That will be what I will do if I'm elected president.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Major, I get a response to that.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~No, Kennedy was confirmed in '87
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Now, Major, the business flat tax that is in my tax plan is not a VAT. A VAT in Europe is a sales tax. The business flat tax is not a sales tax, it is a tax of 16 percent opposed fairly and evenly across the board on all business.One of the things that's critical is we're doing that in conjunction with abolishing the corporate income tax, with abolishing the Obamacare taxes, with abolishing the payroll taxes, which are the biggest taxes paid by most working Americans, and with abolishing the death tax, which is cruel and unfair. And you asked about economic growth &mdash; the nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimated a simple flat tax that would produce 4.9 million new jobs, it would increase capital investment by 44 percent and would lift everyone's income by double digits.That's how you turn the country around, not just hoping and praying for it, but implementing policies that work.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Now, that moment
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~So I'll tell you what
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~South Carolina, you have a critical choice to make. Our country literally hangs in the balance.Do you want another Washington deal maker who will do business as usual, cut deals with the Democrats, grow government, grow debt and give up our fundamental liberties? Or do you want a conservative, a proven conservative that will stand and fight with you each and every day?Listen, repealing Obamacare is not going to be easy. Passing a simple flat tax that abolishes the I.R.S. is not going to be easy, but if we stand with the American people, we can do it.And today, we saw just how great the stakes are. Two branches of government hang in the balance. Not just the presidency but the Supreme Court. If we get this wrong, if we nominate the wrong candidates, the Second Amendment, life, marriage, religious liberty &mdash; every one of those hangs in the balance.My little girls are here. I don't want to look my daughters in the eyes and say, "We lost their liberties." Who do you know will defend the Constitution and Bill of Rights? And as a commander in chief, who do you know will stand up to our enemies as the clam, steady, deliberate, strength to defeat our enemies, to secure our borders and to keep America safe.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~That's what Donald Trump does.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~That is absolutely false. What he said is knowingly false. And I would note, if you want to assess &mdash; if you want to assess
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~That is simply [crosstalk]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~That moment was what Reagan would call "a time for choosing." When it comes to deciding which side of the line you're on, the Rubio-Schumer amnesty plan [booing] apparently supported by the donor class, which is why Washington supported it. The Rubio-Schumer amnesty plan passed the Senate, and it was on the verge of passing the House.House leadership intended to take it up and pass it with the Democrats overruling most of the Republicans. And the question for anyone on illegal immigration is, where were you in that fight? Where did you stand?You are right. There is a difference between Senator Rubio and me on this question.[crosstalk]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~We have Kurds in both Iraq and Syria. They are fighting ISIS right now. They are winning victories right now. ISIS is using American military equipment they've seized in Iraq. And the Obama administration refuses to arm the Kurds, the pesh merga, the fighting forces who have been longtime allies.We ought to be arming them and letting them fight. Now, if we need to embed Special Forces to direct our overwhelming air power, if it is required to use ground troops to defeat ISIS, we should use them, but we ought to start with using our incredible air power advantage.The first Persian Gulf War, we launched 1,100 air attacks a day. Today, we're launching between 15 and 30. We're not using the tools we have, and it's because the commander in chief is not focused on defeating the enemy.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Well, let me say it at the outset that everyone here understands &mdash; everyone understands that how &mdash; that the middle class has been left behind in the last seven years of the Obama economy, and we've got to bring jobs back. We've got to get people back to work. We've got to get wages going up again. We've got to get people moving from part-time work to full-time work.We all agree on that, but it's not going to be solved with magic pixie dust. It's just going to be solved by declaring into the air, "Let there be jobs." We actually have to understand the principles that made America great in the first place.Now, where do you get economic growth? If you look at cause and effect over our nation's history, every time we lessen the burden of Washington on small-business owners, on job creators, we see incredible economic growth. You do that through tax reform and regulatory reform.My tax plan &mdash; typical family of four, first $36,000 you earn, you pay nothing in taxes &mdash; no income taxes, no payroll taxes, no nothing. Above 10 percent, everyone pays the same simple, flat 10 percent income rate. It's flat and fair. You can fill out your taxes on a postcard, and we abolish the I.R.S. If you want to see the postcard, I've got it on my website.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Well, we have 80 years of precedent of not confirming Supreme Court justices in an election year. And let me say, Justice Scalia
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Well, we need to focus on what the objective is, you know? Your question about the first three questions you would ask in this Situation Room. I think it is a problem if the president, commander in chief, we've elected does not have the experience and background to understand the threats facing this country coming in on Day 1.If you look at the threats facing this country, the single gravest threat, national security threat, is the threat of a nuclear Iran. That's why I've pledged on Day 1 to rip to shreds this Iranian nuclear deal, and anyone that thinks you can negotiate Khamenei does not understand the nature of Khamenei.When it comes to ISIS, we've got to have a focused objective. One of the problems of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's foreign policy, and, sadly, too many establishment Republicans in Washington, is they focus on issues unrelated to protecting this country. They focus on nation building, they focus on toppling governments to promote democracy, and it ends up undermining our national security.Now, with regard to ISIS, we need a commander in chief that sets the objective we will utterly defeat them because they have declared war. They've declared a jihad on us.Now, what do we need [bell rings] to carry that out. We need overwhelming air power, we need to arm the Kurds, who can be our boots on the ground, and if ground troops are necessary, then we should employ them, but it shouldn't be politicians demonstrating political toughness. It should be military expert judgment carrying out the objectives set out by the commander in chief. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~Well, you know, your question highlights a sharp difference on immigration on this stage. You know, in a Republican primary, everyone talks tough on immigration. Everyone is against illegal immigration in a Republican primary. But as voters, we've been burned over and over again by people that give us a great campaign speech and they don't walk the walk.There are sharp differences on amnesty. If you look at the folks on this stage, when Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and establishment Republicans were leading the fight to pass a massive amnesty plan, I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and the American people and led the fight to defeat that amnesty plan. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~who is telling the truth [crosstalk]If you want to assess who is telling the truth [applause] then you should look to Jeff Sessions, who said, without Ted Cruz the Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill would have passed, and Ted was responsible. You should look to Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, that said [crosstalk]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~You can see it out of Donald's own mouth.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~You know how I know that?
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~You know, flexibility is a good thing, but it shouldn't &mdash; you shouldn't be flexible on core principles. I like Donald, he is an amazing entertainer, but his policies for most of his life
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~You know, the lines are very, very clear. Marco right now supports citizenship for 12 million people here illegally. I oppose citizenship. Marco stood on the debate stage and said that.But I would note not only that &mdash; Marco has a long record when it comes to amnesty. In the state of Florida, as speaker of the house, he supported in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. In addition to that, Marco went on Univision in Spanish and said he would not rescind President Obama's illegal executive amnesty on his first day in office.I have promised to rescind every single illegal executive action, including that one.[applause and booing]And on the question [crosstalk]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~You need to learn to not interrupt people.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~You said, "Planned Parenthood does wonderful things and we should not defund it."
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~You see, you and I
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~You supported it when we were battling over defunding Planned Parenthood. You went on
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Greenville, South Carolina~February 13, 2016~You want to go [crosstalk]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~And you could still have thousands of dollars left over. And let me just finish, because I don't get to talk that much. And, you know, let's [applause] you can have the money that's left over to buy your catastrophic insurance. But most importantly, we give them a menu, just like we do in Medicare Part C, and they have the choices that will allow them not only to have catastrophic health care, but drug care and everything else.It will be such a good program that nobody will want Obamacare after that, and that's probably the best way do it, although if anybody still did, I would still de-fund it.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Can somebody attack me, please? [laughter and applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I believe in liberty and justice for all. I think everything that we do should be fair. And I've already described &mdash; you know, how we can secure the border.We need to secure all the borders, because it's not just people coming in from South America and Mexico, but there are terrorists who want to destroy us, who are getting across our borders fairly easily. And we have to stop that.But in terms of the people who are here already, after we &mdash; after we stop the illegal immigration, we need to be reasonable. And I would give them a six-month period in which to get registered as a guest worker, assuming that they have an acceptable record.They have to pay a back-tax penalty, have to pay taxes going forward, but they don't have to live underground anymore. And I think they do not become American citizens, they do not vote.If they want to become an American citizen, they go through exactly the same process that anybody else goes through. I think that's the kind of situation that is actually fair to people.And we have other ways of &mdash; of utilizing our facilities and our talents as foreign aid: doing things in South America and Central America and Mexico that improve the economy there, so that they don't feel the need to come over here. That would cost us a lot less than borrowing money from China, paying interest on it.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I didn't hear the first part of the question?
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I think allowing terrorist to get away with things is bad for America. [applause]You know, we have the &mdash; we have a Constitution. We have a Fourth Amendment. It guards us against illegal and unreasonable search and seizure. But we have mechanisms in place with the judicial system that will allow us to gain material that is necessary to benefit the nation as a whole or the community as a whole. And that's why we have FISA courts and things of that nature.So absolutely, I would &mdash; I would expect Apple to comply with the court order. If they don't comply with that, you're encouraging chaos in our system.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~If someone had tried to describe today's America to you 30 years ago, you would have listened in disbelief. Americans know that our nation is heading off the abyss of destruction, secondary to divisiveness, fiscal irresponsibility, and failure to lead.Marco, Donald, Ted, John, we will not solve any of these problems by trying to destroy each other. What we need to do is be looking for solutions tonight. It's not about us, it's about the American people. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~My name was mentioned.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~OK, well, first of all, let me just mention that last year at the NALEO, the National Association for Latino Elected Officials, I was the only one of 17 Republican candidates to go there.And the reason that I don't fear going to an organization like that is because the message that I give is the same message to every group. You know, this is America. And we need to have policies that are &mdash; that give liberty and justice to all people.And that's the way that I have fashioned virtually every policy, looking at that. And I think that's the way the Republican Party generally thinks. We don't pick and choose winners and losers. We are compassionate.But real compassion is providing people with a ladder of opportunity to climb up from a state of dependence and become part of the fabric of America. When we begin to emphasize that, I think we will attract everybody. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~OK. We have a system of taxation in this country that is horribly wrong. You know, I never had an audit until I spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast, and then all of a sudden, they came in, they said we just want to look at your real estate dealings. And then they didn't find anything, so they said let's look at the whole year. And they didn't find anything, so they said let's look at the next year and the next year. They didn't find anything and they won't find anything because I'm a very honest person.But he fact of the matter is the IRS is not honest and we need to get rid of them. [applause]And as far as Israel is concerned, you know, when I was there several months ago, I talked to a lot of people. I couldn't find a single one who didn't think that we had turned our backs on Israel. You know, they are a strategic partner for us but also recognize that we have a Judeo Christian foundation, and the last thing we need to do is to reject Israel. It doesn't mean that we can't be fair to other people. We can always be fair to other people, but, you know, it's like when you have a child, you know, you want to be fair to all the children around but you have a special attention for your own child.And now, as far as North Korea is concerned, you know, Kim Jung Un is an unstable person, but he does understand strength. And I think we have to present strength to him. We should be encouraging the alliance with Japan and South Korea. We should be encouraging the placement of the THAAD, the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, that seems to disturb not only the North Koreans but the Chinese as well.And we also need to have a much more robust naval presence in that area, and I think we need to be developing strategic defense initiative because this man is going to have long-range missiles, he is going to have nuclear capabilities. We need to be able to defend ourselves. And lastly, we should make sure that he knows that if he ever shoots a missile at us, it will be the last thing he ever does. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~OK. Well first of all, people say that I whine a lot because I don't get time. I'm going to whine because I didn't get asked about taxes, I didn't get asked about Israel. Hugh, you said you're going to be fair to everybody, you didn't ask me about taxes. I had something to say about that.Now
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well first of all, I want people to think about what kind of leader do you want and what kind of person do you want your kids to emulate. Think about that.Secondly, several years ago, a movie was made about these hands. These hands by the grace of God have saved many lives and healed many families. And I'm asking you tonight, America, to join hands with me to heal, inspire and revive America. If not us, who? And if not now, when? [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, first of all, healthcare is not a right. But I do believe it is a responsibility for a responsible society, and we are that. We spend almost twice as much per capita on healthcare as many other nations who have actually much better access than we do.I propose a system in which we use health empowerment accounts, which are like a health savings account with no bureaucrats. And we give it to everybody from birth until death. They can pass it on when they die. We pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional healthcare with. We give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account within their family. So dad's $500 short, mom can give it to him or a cousin or uncle.And it makes every family their own insurance carrier with no middle man. It gives you enormous flexibility. And also, you know, if Uncle Joe is smoking like a chimney, everybody's going to hide his cigarettes because they're all interested in what's going on there.Also, the &mdash; your catastrophic healthcare is going to cost a lot less money now because the only thing coming out of that is catastrophic healthcare. So, it's like a homeowners policy with a large deductible, versus a homeowners policy where you want every scratch covered. One costs $1,500 a year; one costs $10,000 a year. You can buy the $1,500 one. That will take care of 75 percent of the people. The people who are indigent, how do we take care of them now? Medicaid. What's the Medicaid budget? Almost $500 billion; almost 80 million people participate, which is way too many, and that will get a lot better when we fix the economy, which I hope we get a chance to talk about.But do the math. Over $5,000 for each man, woman and child, and all &mdash; they will have a lot more flexibility. What could you buy with that? A concierge practice.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, first of all, let me just add my praise to Justice Scalia. I first met him when we got an honorary degree together a long time ago. A tremendous wit and intellect.As far as religious freedom is concerned, one of the basic tenets of this nation, and I believe that the Constitution protects all of our rights. And it gives people who believe in same-sex marriage the same rights as everybody else.But what we have to remember is even though everybody has the same rights, nobody get extra rights. So nobody gets to redefine things for everybody else and then have them have to conform to it. That's unfair.And this is the responsibility of Congress to come back and correct what the Supreme Court has done. That's why we have divided government. And we're going to have to encourage them to act in an appropriate way, or we will lose our religious freedom.And as president, I would go through and I would look at what a person's life has been. What have they done in the past? What kind of judgments have they made? What kind of associations do they have? That will tell you a lot more than an interview will tell you.The fruit salad of their life is what I will look at.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Yes, amen, amen. [laughter]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~[inaudible]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~[inaudible] audited for those years.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~[inaudible] I took
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~[inaudible] I watched him repeat himself five times four weeks ago
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~[inaudible].
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~A lot. I'll negotiate a lot more money than you'll ever get.As far as John Kerry is concerned, there has been no tougher critic of this man, I think he negotiated one of the worst deals in the history of our country, the Iran deal, where they get their $150 billion and all of the other things that take place.It is a disaster for this country, and speaking of Israel, it's a disaster for Israel. I'm no fan of John Kerry.[crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Again, I think I gave them both checks to be exactly honest. I think they both liked me very much. But the fact is that
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~All right, you know what?
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~All right. First of all, let me just explain. I was the first one to file a financial disclosure form &mdash; almost 100 pages. You don't learn anything about somebody's wealth with a tax return. You learn it from statements.I filed &mdash; which shows that I'm worth over $10 billion. I built a great company with very little debt. People were shocked, the people in the back, the reporters, they were shocked when they went down. And I filed it on time. I didn't ask for five 45-day extensions, which I would have been entitled to.So as far as that's concerned, I filed it. And that's where you find out what kind of a company. You don't learn anything from a tax return.I will say this. Mitt Romney looked like a fool when he delayed and delayed and delayed. And Harry Reid baited him so beautifully. And Mitt Romney didn't file his return until a September 21st of 2012, about a month-and-a-half before the election. And it cost him big league.As far as my return, I want to file it, except for many years, I've been audited every year. Twelve years, or something like that. Every year they audit me, audit me, audit me.Nobody gets audited &mdash; I have friends that are very wealthy people. They never get audited. I get audited every year. I will absolutely give my return, but I'm being audited now for two or three years, so I can't do it until the audit is finished, obviously. And I think people would understand that.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~and by the way
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~And by the way &mdash; and by the way
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~And by the way, I've hired &mdash; and by the way, I've hired tens of thousands of people over at my job. You've hired nobody.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~And by the way, the laws were totally different. That was a whole different world.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~And they actually did a very good job, but I've won most of the lawsuits.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~and, it was almost done &mdash; not now
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~And, you're going to see &mdash; excuse me. You're going to see preexisting conditions and everything else be part of it, but the price will be done, and the insurance companies can pay. Right now they're making a fortune. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~And, you don't know what it means
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Are you going to ask anybody else that question?
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Be honest. Be honest. No, this was before. The check came early. But let me just tell you, Syria, he's saying that I was in favor of Syria. He said I was in favor of Libya? I never discussed that subject. I was in favor of Libya? We would be so much better off if Gadhafi were in charge right now.If these politicians went to the beach and didn't do a thing, and we had Saddam Hussein and if we had Gadhafi in charge, instead of having terrorism all over the place, we'd be &mdash; at least they killed terrorists, all right?And I'm not saying they were good because they were bad, they were really bad, but we don't know what we're getting. You look at Libya right now, ISIS, as we speak, is taking over their oil. As we speak, it's a total mess.We would have been better off if the politicians took a day off instead of going into war. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Be quiet. Just be quiet. [applause]   Let me talk. I've hired tens of thousands of people. He brings up something from 30 years ago, it worked out very well. Everybody was happy.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Because the country will become a dynamic economy. We'll be dynamic again. If you look at what's going on, we have the highest taxes anywhere in the world. We pay more business tax, we pay more personal tax. We have the highest taxes in the world.It's shutting off our economy. It's shutting off our country. We have trillions of dollars outside that we can't get in. Yes, we will do my tax plan, and it will be great. We will have a dynamic economy again.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Because they devalue their currency &mdash; they devalue their currencies
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~But I've hired people. Nobody up here has hired anybody. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~But you wouldn't know anything about it because you're a lousy businessman.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Call it what you want, people are not going to be dying on the sidewalk.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~competition
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Correct.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Correct. I will not let people die on the streets if I'm president.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Eighty-five percent say you, big difference.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Every single question comes to me?
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Excuse me, I want to be able to bring peace
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Excuse me. Excuse me.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Excuse me. He ran one terrible campaign. That's an election that should have been won. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Excuse me. Hey Wolf, let me ask you. Am I allowed to respond to this?
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Excuse me. Let me talk. If people
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~excuse me. She's a brilliant judge. He's been criticizing &mdash; he's been criticizing my sister for signing a certain bill. You know who else signed that bill? Justice Samuel Alito, a very conservative member of the Supreme Court, with my sister, signed that bill.So I think that maybe we should get a little bit of an apology from Ted. What do you think?
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Excuse me. We are going to take those people and those people are going to be serviced by doctors and hospitals. We're going to make great deals on it, but we're not going to let them die in the streets.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~First of all
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~first of all, he's talking about the polls. I'm beating him awfully badly in the polls.[crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~First of all, he was in charge of amnesty, he was the leader, and you can ask Marco because they've been debating this every debate that we've had.As far as coming back in, number one, you wouldn't even be talking, and you wouldn't have asked that as the first question if it weren't for me when my opening when I talked about illegals immigration. It wouldn't even be a big subject.But, we either have a country, or we don't have a country. We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally. They will go out. They will come back &mdash; some will come back, the best, through a process. They have to come back legally. They have to come back through a process, and it may not be a very quick process, but I think that's very fair, and very fine.They're going to get in line with other people. The best of them will come back, but they're going to come back through a process. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~First of all, I don't believe anything Telemundo says.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~first of all, that's called a
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~First of all, you're talking about a border that's many, many times longer. You're talking about a massive border.We have far less problem with that border than we do with our Southern border, and tremendous amounts &mdash; you know, I won, I had the privilege of winning by a landslide, by the way, New Hampshire.You go to New Hampshire, the first thing they talk about is heroin and drugs pouring in. And, you wouldn't think this beautiful place &mdash; it's beautiful. With the trees and the roads, and the countryside. Their biggest problem is heroin, and it's such a shame to see it.They're pouring in from the Southern border, so I'm talking about great security. I'm talking about a wall that can absolutely be built, and I'll build it on time, on budget. It'll be a very high wall, a great wall. It's going to be built, it's going to be built. It's going to be paid for by Canada, by the way &mdash; maybe I'll get Canada to pay? Got to be paid for by Mexico.The problem with Canada, you're talking about a massively long piece. You're talking about a border that would be about four times longer. It would be very, very hard to do, and we &mdash; it is not our biggest problem. I don't care what anyone says. It is not our big problem. Our big problem is not only people coming in, and in many cases the wrong people, it's the tremendous amount of drugs that are coming in. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~for the obvious reason, and he can't do it because he doesn't know how to tell the truth. Other than that, I rest my case.[crosstalk]

Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~He will never be able to do it. I think I may be able to do it, although I will say this. Probably the toughest deal of any kind is that particular deal.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Here's a guy &mdash; here's a guy that buys a house for $179,000, he sells it to a lobbyist who's probably here for $380,000 and then legislation is passed. You tell me about this guy. This is what we're going to have as president.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Here's a man &mdash; Robin Hood. This is Robin Hood over here. He talks about corruption. On his financial disclosure form, he didn't even put that he's borrowed money from Citibank and from Goldman Sachs, which is a total violation. He didn't talk about the fact that he pays almost no interest. He just left it off, and now he's going to protect the people from the big bad banks.Give me a break.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I'm a negotiator. I've done very well over the years through negotiation. It's very important that we do that. In all fairness, Marco is not a negotiator. I watched him melt down and I'll tell you, it was one of the saddest things I've ever seen. He's not going down &mdash; excuse me
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I'm being audited 12 years in a row, at least.Now, until that audit's done, and I don't think anybody would blame me, I'm not giving it [crosstalk]

Very good people.I'm just telling you &mdash; I'm just telling you that I will do really well with Hispanics. I will do better than anybody on this stage. I have respect for the people on the stage, but I will do very well with Hispanics. But I'm telling you also, I'm bringing people, Democrats over and I'm bringing independents over, and we're building a much bigger, much stronger Republican Party.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I'm not afraid [inaudible].

Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I can only say this, and I've said it loud and clear and I've said it for years. And many of these people are sitting right in the audience right now &mdash; your lobbyist and your special interest and your donors, because the audience is packed with them, and they're packed with you.I've had an amazing relationship with politicians &mdash; with politicians both Democrat, Republican, because I was a businessman. As one magazine said, he's a world-class businessman; he was friendly with everybody. I got along with everybody.You get along with nobody. You don't have one Republican &mdash; you don't have one Republican senator, and you work with them every day of your life, although you skipped a lot of time. These are minor details. But you don't have one Republican senator backing you; not one. You don't have the endorsement of one Republican senator and you work with these people. You should be ashamed of yourself. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I criticized Mitt Romney for losing the election. He should have won that election. He had a failed president.

Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I do not want socialized medicine, just so you understand. He goes around saying oh, he wants it. I do not want socialized medicine. I do agree with him that it's going to be a disaster, Obamacare, for the economy.In 2017, it will be impossible for us to pay for it if you look at what's going on. That's why it has to be repealed, for a lot of reasons, Number one, it doesn't work, number two, premium. You look at premiums going up, 25, 35, even 45 percent, and more. We have to get rid of Obamacare. It is going to destroy our economy completely. Our economy is not doing well. It is going to destroy our economy greatly. And on that, I agree.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I funded this guy. I gave him a check.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I funded you. I funded him. Can you believe it? [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I gave him a check. He never funded me.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I have to say, he lied this time. He lied. 100 percent. 100 percent.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I just want to say &mdash; and I'm a big fan of the governor, but they also struck oil, OK, so that helped Iowa a lot.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I just want to say, I agree with that 100 percent, except pre-existing conditions, I would absolutely get rid of Obamacare. We're going to have something much better, but pre-existing conditions, when I'm referring to that, and I was referring to that very strongly on the show with Anderson Cooper, I want to keep pre- existing conditions.I think we need it. I think it's a modern age. And I think we have to have it. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I know I'm here for the ratings, but it's a little bit ridiculous. [laughter]

Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I love them. I love them. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I never said walk away. I wouldn't want to walk away. I want them to pay us much more money. We cannot afford to subsidize
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I really don't because it not working and the countries aren't agreeing to it and the rebels aren't agreeing and Syria is not agreeing. So It's a meaningless ceasefire.I love the idea of a ceasefire. I love the idea of &mdash; with a total cessation. But it's not working, as you know very well. It's not working. If &mdash; we can do what we want with Russia but nobody else is adhering to it.So I certainly support it, I would certainly love it, but all parties have to be part of it.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I tell the truth, I tell the truth.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I think they're wrong 100 percent. What we need &mdash; look, the insurance companies take care of the politicians. The insurance companies get what they want. We should have gotten rid of the lines around each state so we can have real competition.We thought that was gone, we thought those lines were going to be gone, so something happened at the last moment where Obamacare got approved, and all of that was thrown out the window.The reason is some of the people in the audience are insurance people, and insurance lobbyists, and special interests. They got &mdash; I'm not going to point to these gentlemen, of course, they're part of the problem, other than Ben, in all fairness.And, actually, the Governor too, let's just talk about these too, OK? [laughter]Because I don't think the Governor had too much to do with this.But, we should have gotten rid of the borders, we should have gotten rid of the lines around the state so there's great competition. The insurance companies are making a fortune on every single thing they do.I'm self-funding my campaign. I'm the only one in either party self-funding my campaign. I'm going to do what's right. We have to get rid of the lines around the states so that there's serious, serious competition.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I thought he came out of the swimming pool
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I watched &mdash; I watched [applause] the lobbyists. I watched what this man did to Dr. Ben Carson, who I respect, in Iowa, where he said that Ben Carson is out of the race &mdash; he has left Iowa and he's out of the race. And I thought it was disgraceful.And got a lot of votes because of that &mdash; a lot of votes. Took them away from Ben Carson. I watched that. Probably took them away from me, too. But I watched it.I also watched where he did a forum that looked like it came right out of a government agency, and it said on top, "Voter Violation," and then it graded you [bell ringing] and it scared the hell out of people, and it said the only way you clear up the violation, essentially, is to go and vote for Ted Cruz. I watched that fraudulent document, and I said it's the worst thing I've ever seen in politics. [bell ringing]To me, that was even worse than what he did to Ben.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I watched him meltdown on the stage like that, I've never seen it in anybody
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I will, and the wall just got 10 feet taller, believe me. [applause]It just got 10 feet taller. I saw him make that &mdash; I saw him make the statement. I saw him use the word that he used. I can only tell you, if I would have used even half of that word, it would have been national scandal.This guy used a filthy, disgusting word on television, and he should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize, OK? Number one. Number two, we have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year. And that doesn't include all the drugs that are pouring across and destroying our country.We're going to make them pay for that wall. Now, the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion, if I do it. If these guys do it, it'll end up costing $200 billion. [applause]But the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion. You need 1,000 &mdash; you need 1,000 miles. The Great Wall of China, built 2,000 years ago &mdash; 2,000, is 13,000 miles. We need 1,000, because we have a lot of natural barriers.We can do it for $10 billion to $12 billion, and it's a real wall. This is a wall that's a heck of a lot higher than the ceiling you're looking at. This is a wall that's going to work.Mexico will pay for it, because they are not doing us any favors. They could stop all of this illegal trade if they wanted to [bell ringing]  immediately. Mexico will pay for the wall. It's a small portion of the kind of money that we lose and the deficits that we have with Mexico. [applause]

[laughter]Let me just tell you, let me just &mdash; which happens to be true. Check out the ratings.Look, let me just tell you something. Let me just tell you something. I want to release my tax returns but I can't release it while I'm under an audit. We're under a routine audit. I've had it for years, I get audited.And obviously if I'm being audited, I'm not going to release a return. As soon as the audit is done, I love it.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~No, I &mdash; and you know why? You know why? [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~No, I did not. No I did not.

Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~No, there's nothing to add. [cheering and applause] What is to add?
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~No.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Nothing.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Number one. Number two, I currently employ thousands of Hispanics, and over the years, I've employed tens of thousands of Hispanics. They're incredible people. They know, and the reason I won in Nevada, not only won the big one, but I also won subs, like, as an example, I won with women.I won with every single category. I won with men, I won with high-income, low-income, I won with Hispanics. And I got 46 percent. Nobody else was close. Because they know I'm going to bring jobs back from China, from Japan, from so many other places.They get it. They're incredible people. They're incredible workers. They get it. And I've won many of the polls with Hispanics. I didn't maybe win the Telemundo poll.But one thing I'm also going to do, I'm going to be getting &mdash; bringing a lot of people in who are Democrats, who are independents, and you're seeing that with the polls, because if you look at anywhere, look at any of the elections, every single election, it has been record-setting.And the good news is, for the Republican Party, the Democrats are getting very poor numbers in terms of bringing them in. We're getting record-setting numbers. I think I have something to do with that.We're getting record-setting numbers. And I won every one &mdash; the three of them that I won, I won with record-setting numbers.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~OK, no, no, no &mdash; a deal is a deal. Let me tell you that. I learned a long time ago.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~OK. Well let &mdash; no, I haven't. I really haven't. [laughter]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~One thing I'd like to add to what the Governor's saying, I think that we are now in a position &mdash; are $19 trillion dollars because of the horrible omnibus budget that was approved six weeks ago, it's going to be $21 trillion dollars. We can no longer defend all of these countries, Japan, Germany, South Korea.You order televisions, you order almost anything, you're getting it from these countries. Whether it's a Mercedes-Benz, or whether it's an air conditioning unit. They're coming out of these countries. They are making a fortune. Saudi Arabia, we are defending Saudi Arabia. Before the oil went down, now they're making less, but they're making plenty. They were making $1 billion dollars a day. [bell ringing]We defend all of these countries for peanuts. You talk about budgets. We have to start getting reimbursed for taking care of the military services for all of these countries. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Right.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Shocking. [laughter]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~So at the beginning, I said openly to everybody that I contribute to many, many politicians, both Republican and Democrat. And I have, over the years. I'm a businessman. I have, over the years.And I sort of have to laugh when Ted makes a big deal out of the fact that he's doing well in the polls. Well, I'm beating him in virtually every poll. I'm tied in Texas, by the way, which I shouldn't be. But I think I'll do very well. [applause]But a poll just came out &mdash; a Bloomberg poll &mdash; where I am beating him so badly that it's, like, embarrassing even for me to say I'm beating him that badly. [applause]And &mdash; and here's the thing &mdash; it was sort of funny &mdash; 65 percent of the people don't like you &mdash; I just got 36 percent of the vote, right? I just got 46 percent on another one. I got 38 percent [bell ringing] on another one. That means &mdash; and he got 20 and 22, and he lost in South Carolina so badly &mdash; that was going to be his stronghold. He said a year ago, "I can't lose South Carolina." I beat him in a landslide.Last week in Nevada, I beat him in a landslide, and he sank about the polls. One other thing &mdash; Hillary Clinton &mdash; take a look at USA Today, take a look at the Q poll. I beat her, and I beat her badly. And I &mdash; and I haven't even started at her. I only had one little interchange [applause] I only had one little interchange, and that was [bell ringing] four weeks ago, when she said I was sexist. And believe me, they had a rough weekend that weekend, between Bill and Hillary. They had a rough weekend. [applause]

We don't win with trade, we don't win with the military. ISIS, we can't even knock out ISIS, and we will, believe me. We will.We don't win in any capacity with healthcare. We have terrible health care, Obamacare is going to be repealed and replaced. We just don't win.You look at our borders, they're like swiss cheese, everybody pours in.We're going to make a great country again. We're going to start winning again. We're going to win a lot, it's going to be a big difference, believe me. It's going to be a big difference. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Thank you.Nobody knows politicians better than I do. They're all talk, they're no action, nothing gets done. I've watched it for years. Take a look at what's happening to our country.All of the things that I've been talking about, whether it's trade, whether it's building up our depleted military, whether it's taking care of our vets, whether it's getting rid of Common Core, which is a disaster, or knocking out Obamacare and coming up with something so much better, I will get it done. Politicians will never, ever get it done. And we will make America great again. Thank you. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~That's false.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~That's going to solve the problem. And, the insurance companies aren't going to say that, they want to keep it. They want to say &mdash; they say whatever they have to say to keep it the way it is. I know the insurance companies, they're friends of mine. The top guys, they're friends of mine. I shouldn't tell you guys, you'll say it's terrible, I have a conflict of interest. They're friends of mine, there's some right in the audience. One of them was just waving to me, he was laughing and smiling. He's not laughing so much anymore.Hi. [applause]Look, the insurance companies are making an absolute fortune. Yes, they will keep preexisting conditions, and that would be a great thing. Get rid of Obamacare, we'll come up with new plans. But, we should keep preexisting conditions.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~That's wrong. That's wrong. Totally wrong.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~That is so wrong. We'll work on that. I took $1 million and I turned into $10 billion.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~that makes it &mdash; well, you don't know a thing about business. You lose on everything

[applause]We are going to cut many of the agencies, we will balance our budget, and we will be dynamic again.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, first of all, I don't think they do under President Obama because I think he's treated Israel horribly, all right? I think he's treated Israel horribly. [applause]I was the grand marshall down 5th Avenue a number of years ago for the Israeli Day Parade, I have very close ties to Israel. I've received the Tree of Life Award and many of the greatest awards given by Israel.As president, however, there's nothing that I would rather do to bring peace to Israel and its neighbors generally. And I think it serves no purpose to say that you have a good guy and a bad guy.Now, I may not be successful in doing it. It's probably the toughest negotiation anywhere in the world of any kind. OK? But it doesn't help if I start saying, "I am very pro-Israel, very pro, more than anybody on this stage." But it doesn't do any good to start demeaning the neighbors, because I would love to do something with regard to negotiating peace, finally, for Israel and for their neighbors.And I can't do that as well &mdash; as a negotiator, I cannot do that as well if I'm taking big, big sides. With that being said, I am totally pro-Israel.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, first of all, self-deportation is people are going to leave as soon as they see others going out. If you look at Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, they started moving people out and the rest of them left.Self-deportation, as I really define it, and that's the way I define it, is you're going to get some to go, and the rest are going to go out.As far as the people that I've hired in various parts of Florida during the absolute prime season, like Palm Beach and other locations, you could not get help. It's the up season. People didn't want to have part-time jobs. There were part-time jobs, very seasonal, 90-day jobs, 120-day jobs, and you couldn't get.Everybody agrees with me on that. They were part-time jobs. You needed them, or we just might as well close the doors, because you couldn't get help in those hot, hot sections of Florida.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, I'm very glad that Ted mentioned Arizona because probably the toughest man on borders is Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and two days ago he totally endorsed me, so, thank you. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, I can only say &mdash; look, I can only say I've been a big contributor to Israel over the years. I've received many, many awards from Israel, as I've said before. I have a great relationship with Israel. And I'm going to keep it that way. And if I could bring peace, that would be a fantastic thing. It would be one of my greatest achievements as president.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, I think Bush did a hell of a bad as far as that's concerned. You know it and so do I.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, let &mdash; let me &mdash; let me just say &mdash; let me just say this. Look, I watched Ted &mdash; and I respected it, but he gets nowhere &mdash; stand on the Senate floor for a day or two days, and talk and talk and talk.I watched the other senators laughing and smiling. And when Ted was totally exhausted, he left the Senate floor, and they went back to work. OK? We have to have somebody that's going to make deals.It's wonderful to stand up for two days and do that. Now, Ted's been very critical &mdash; I have a sister who's a brilliant
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, let &mdash; let me just say &mdash; let me just say, first of all, I have great respect for Justice Scalia. I thought he was terrific. And if you talk about evolving, Ronald Reagan was a somewhat liberal Democrat. Ronald Reagan evolved into a somewhat strong conservative &mdash; more importantly, he was a great president. A great president.As far as Planned Parenthood is concerned, I'm pro-life. I'm totally against abortion, having to do with Planned Parenthood. But millions and millions of women &mdash; cervical cancer, breast cancer &mdash; are helped by Planned Parenthood.So you can say whatever you want, but they have millions of women going through Planned Parenthood that are helped greatly. And I wouldn't fund it.I would defund it because of the abortion factor, which they say is 3 percent. I don't know what percentage it is. They say it's 3 percent. But I would defund it, because I'm pro-life. But millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, look, my response is very simple. There is nobody on this stage that has done more for Israel than I have. Nobody. You might say, you might talk, you're politicians, all talk, no action. [applause]I've been watching it all my life. You are all talk and no action.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, then, if I can't &mdash; if &mdash; hey, if I can't beat her, you're really going to get killed, aren't you? [applause]So &mdash; so let me ask you this, because you're really getting beaten badly. I know you're embarrassed &mdash; I know you're embarrassed, but keep fighting &mdash; keep swinging, man. Swing for the fences.Let me just tell you &mdash; let me just tell you, the Trump University case is a civil case. Not a &mdash; it's a civil case. It's a case where people want to try and get &mdash; it's a case that is nonsense.It's something I could have settled many times. I could settle it right now for very little money, but I don't want to do it out of principle. The people that took the course all signed &mdash; most &mdash; many &mdash; many signed report cards saying it was fantastic, it was wonderful, it was beautiful.As &mdash; and believe me, I'll win that case. That's an easy case. Civil case. Number two, as far as the taxes are concerned, I'm being audited. It's a very routine audit, and it's very unfair, because I've been audited for, I think, over 12 years.Every year, because of the size of my company, which is very, very large, I'm being audited &mdash; which is a very large company.[bell ringing]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, you know, I don't mind trade wars when we're losing $58 billion a year, you want to know the truth. We're losing so much. [applause]We're losing so much with Mexico and China &mdash; with China, we're losing $500 billion a year. And then people say, "don't we want to trade?" I don't mind trading, but I don't want to lose $500 billion. I don't want to lose $58 billion.Mexico just took Carrier Corporation, maker of air conditioners. They just took Ford. They're building a $2.5 billion plant. They just took Nabisco out of Chicago.And I always say I'm not having Oreos anymore, which is true, by the way. But they just took a big plant from Nabisco into Mexico. They're taking our businesses. I don't mind.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~What I've seen up here &mdash; I mean, first of all, this guy is a choke artist, and this guy is a liar. You have a combination
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~When you say crazy zealot, are you talking about you? Crazy zealot &mdash; give me a break.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Why did they take the poll? Why did they [crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Yes, I would. And I've been there. And I've been there very strongly. I do have to say something, and this is interesting and it's not anybody's fault. It's not Ted's fault. Justice Roberts was strongly recommended and pushed by Ted. Justice Roberts gave us Obamacare. Might as well be called Roberts-care. Two times of the Supreme Court, Justice Roberts approved something that he should have never raised his hand to approve. And we ended up with Obamacare.That is a rough thing. And I know Ted feels badly about it. And I think he probably still respects the judge. But that judge has been a disaster in terms of everything we stand for because there is no way &mdash; no way that he should have approved Obamacare.Now, with that being said, these are the things that happen. But Ted very, very strongly pushed Judge Roberts, and Justice Roberts gave us something that we don't want.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Yes, yes, yes. 38 years ago.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~You're losing so badly you &mdash; I want to
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~You've had nothing but problems with your credit cards, et cetera. So don't tell me about that.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~You &mdash; you don't
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~You are not a negotiator. You are not a negotiator. [applause]And, with your thinking, you will never bring peace. You will never bring peace
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~You don't know much
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~You don't know.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~You get rid of the lines, it brings in competition. So, instead of having one insurance company taking care of New York, or Texas, you'll have many. They'll compete, and it'll be a beautiful thing.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~You have a combination of factors. He can't do it
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~You haven't hired one person, you liar.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~You know what? Call it what you want.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~You know why?
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~You know why? I didn't want to, but he sent me his book with his autograph [crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~You know, I watched him meltdown two weeks ago with Chris Christie. I got to tell you, the biggest problem he's got is he really doesn't know about the lines. The biggest thing we've got, and the reason we've got no competition, is because we have lines around the state, and you have essentially .
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~and assert ourselves as America.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~and we're going to have to work our way out of it, including
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Hey, Wolf, let me just say this because he mentioned this. Look, we're all in agreement that the Japanese need to do more. We're all in agreement that the Europeans need to do more, but I hate to just tell everybody we are the leader of the world and we should put the pressure on them to do their job. There is no question about it.But, at the same time, we also have to rebuild the military. Look, I have a balanced budget plan that cuts taxes, reforms regulations, but also builds the military, puts a $100 billion dollars more in defense. We need to rebuild our defenses,But, I must also tell you, a long time reformer of the Pentagon, we must reform that building. [bell ringing]We can't have a weapon system take 22 and a half years. We have 800,000 bureaucrats working for DOD, performing bureaucratic functions when we ought to be putting
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Hey, Wolf, Wolf
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~How do you &mdash; how do you get that extra time, Cruz? You're very good at
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I'm very well aware of that.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I want to weigh in on this please. I want to just tell you that the problem is not right now between the administration and Apple. You know what the problem is? Where's the president been? You sit down in a back room and you sit down with the parties and you get this worked out. You don't litigate this on the front page of the New York Times, where everybody in the world is reading about their dirty laundry out here.The president of the United States should be convening a meeting, should have convened a meeting with Apple and our security forces. And then you know what you do when you're the president? You lock the door and you say you're not coming out until you reach an agreement that both gives the security people what they need and protects the rights of Americans. This is a failure of his leadership to get this done as an executive should be doing it.And I'll tell you, that's why you want a governor. I do this all the time. And we reach agreements all the time. Because as an executive, you've got to solve problems instead of fighting on the front page of the newspaper.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Look, we have a great president here, George Bush, the 41st president of the United States. He worked with Ronald Reagan to pass an effort to try to solve this problem &mdash; a path to legalization. You see, that was a time when things worked. It was a time when President Reagan and George Bush decided that we needed to make the country work.Look, I think there is an answer here. The answer is you complete the border. You let people know that once it's done, you don't have a right to come in. If you come in, we don't want any excuse. You're going to go back. But I favor a guest worker program. I think it's practical. And I think for the 11 million or 11.5 million Americans &mdash; the illegals that are here, if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, I'd make them pay a fine, some back taxes, maybe some community service. And at the end, I'd give them a path to legalization, but not a path to citizenship. I don't think we're going to tear families apart. I don't think we're going to ride around in people's neighborhoods and grab people out of their homes. I don't think &mdash; first of all, I don't think it's practical and I don't think it reflects America.You know what happened? The problem with President Reagan is we didn't get in there and actually finish the border. And I think it was probably business interests that affected it. But at the end of the day, let's be practical. Let's start solving problems in this country instead of kicking them upstairs. With President Reagan and George Bush, it was a bipartisan coalition to address the issue, and I think we can and should do it again. And I will have a plan in the first 100 days to get it done and get this issue behind us. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~No, I wouldn't. And &mdash; but that doesn't matter when it comes to the issue of preexisting conditions. You don't want any American to lose their house, everything they've saved, because they get sick. Now, I think it is more complicated than what we've heard here tonight. We're actually running significant health reform in my state.I would repeal Obamacare for a variety of reasons. I would take some of the federal resources, combine it with the freed-up Medicaid program, which I would send back to the states, and cover the people who are currently the working poor because we don't want to have tens of millions of Americans losing their health insurance.And then we're driving towards total transparency. If any of you here ever get a hospital bill, it's easier to interpret the Dead Sea scrolls than to understand your hospital bill. The fact is what we need is transparency with hospitals and with the providers.And I'll tell you what we will do. We are actually going to make payments to physicians and to hospitals who actually deliver healthcare with great quality at low prices. We actually are going to make the market work.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~OK, let me &mdash; let me &mdash; let me just talk about that, because I know that &mdash; that Donald believes the energy industry is important. So do I. But of the over 400,000 jobs that we've created in the state, we think maybe 15,000 are connected to this industry, because it's early-stage.See, what we've done in Ohio, and what a president needs to do, is to have a cabinet and a whole operation that's jobs-friendly. We have diversified our economy.We &mdash; we do have energy, we have medical devices, we have financial services, we have I.T., we just got Amazon &mdash; their Cloud computing in the Midwest. You know why it's happening? [bell ringing]Because we're balanced budgets, we're strong, we're job-friendly, we don't raise their taxes, and if we have a president that does that in America, we will get the economic growth, and that is what this country needs. Jobs, jobs and jobs, period. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Thank you.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Thank you. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~the need to arm the Ukrainians. They have been ignored, and we need to help them as well
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~There's a critical point that needs to be made here. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~There's something &mdash; I want to &mdash; I want to point out something here today that is &mdash; it's so critically important &mdash; about how the Obama administration has really done such a ridiculous, feckless job here in foreign policy.First of all, we should have been supporting the rebels long ago. They could have taken Assad out, and because we did nothing, the Russians are in, and they're sitting in the catbird seat.We should have been helping them. I'm thankful that the aid trucks are finally getting into Syria. But the fact is, had we had acted, we would have solved that problem.Now, let's talk about Libya. Libya didn't go down because there was some people revolution. Hillary Clinton, Samantha Power and all these other people convinced the president to undermine Gadhafi. They undermined him, and now they have created a cesspool in Libya.And let me just say to you &mdash; we have ISIS beginning get &mdash; get a foothold in Libya. We're gonna have to deal with it. There are not many major cities in Libya. They're on the coast, which &mdash; mostly, it's desert, but it's a problem.Then we have ISIS in &mdash; in Syria, and we have ISIS in Iraq. Because this administration has not had a strong and firm foreign policy, we are going to inherit &mdash; one of us here is going to inherit a total mess
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~these resources into strengthening the military. So, we can do it all
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, Dana, the Heritage Foundation had this position as well. And when I look at it, I don't think it's tenable. And we don't need to do that. Again, I'm telling you that we are going to &mdash; we have a proposal, a plan that we're enacting now that says if you are a hospital or a doctor and you're providing very high quality at lower prices, below the midpoint &mdash; some charge high, some charge low. If you are below the midpoint, we are going to give you a financial reward for allowing you to provide services that result in high quality for our people at lower pricess.That is the way in which we are going to damp down the rising costs of healthcare. Because if you think about your own deductibles today, they're going higher, higher and higher. And you know what? At some point, people can't afford it. Our plan will work. It uses the market. It uses transparency. It gets the patient in the middle. And guess what? We're actually doing it in my state, the seventh-largest state in the country. And if this will go &mdash; this will go national, we will get our hands on healthcare where you will know what's going on. We will pay for quality, lower prices, and we will begin to see healthcare become affordable in America and where people will also be able to have health insurance, even if they have a preexisting condition.We don't want to throw millions of people out into the cold and not have the health insurance, Dana. So that's really what we're doing. This is not a theory. This is what we are actually doing in our state. We will begin payments next year based on episodes that we have in our lives. If our primary care physicians keep us healthy for a year, with really high quality, guess what? They will get a financial reward.Our primary care physicians need help. They need support. We're losing them. This will allow them to get a reward for doing a great job.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, I'm not going to talk about that. I mean, I've got to tell you, I was with this little 12-year-old girl, was at a town hall meeting, and she said, you know, I don't like all this yelling and screaming at the debates. My mother's thinking I might not be able to watch the thing anymore.I think we ought to move beyond that, about what they think. I'm going to tell you what I think. My position on this whole immigration issue has been clear from the beginning. I haven't changed anything with it.And, look, my view is, we need economic growth. Everything starts with economic growth. And how do you get it? Common sense regulations, lower taxes for both business and individuals, and, of course, a fiscal plan that balances the budget.That gives you economic growth. I did it when I was in Washington, as the Budget Committee chairman, negotiating actually with Democrats, that gave us surpluses, economic growth, and the same thing in Ohio.But here's the thing that I believe. Economic growth is not an end unto itself. We have to make sure that everybody has a sense that they can rise.Of course, our friends in the Hispanic community, our friends in the African-American community, the promise of America is that our system, when we follow the right formula, is going to give opportunity for everyone.It's what Jack Kemp used to say. A rising tide lifts all boats, not just some boats, but all boats. And you know what? With me and the Hispanic community, I think they like me. And I appreciate that, because I want them to have the same opportunity that I and my children and my wife and the people we love have had in this country.It's time to solve problems. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, I mean, well, I was in Congress for 18 years on the Defense Committee. And then, you know, after 9/11, the secretary of defense called me in to help out with some things. And I've been a supporter of Israel &mdash; a strong supporter of Israel longer than anybody on this stage. I didn't give as much money as Donald gave, but I've been standing with the Israelis for a very long time.And frankly, I think the problem we have in foreign policy right now, Wolf, is that we are not certain with who we stand with. Our allies are not sure what to make of us, and our enemies are moving. And one &mdash; are moving because they're not sure what we will do.It's a very interesting development here within the 24 hours. We said to the South Koreans that we would give them the high altitude defense system. It really rattled the Chinese, and for the first time since we took positive action, the Chinese are beginning to take action against North Korea.When we stand firm and we let the world know who we're with, who we stand for, and we bring our allies together, that is the road forward.[crosstalk] [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, I think it takes three things, Wolf. And I've done it. I mean, I &mdash; we got the budget balanced. We cut the capital gains tax. You see, in order to get this economy moving again, you have to grow the economy, and you have to restrain the spending.And when I was chairman, we cut that capital gains tax and we instituted a significant program to get to balance. We had a balanced budget four years in a row, had to take on every interest group in Washington &mdash; every single one of them &mdash; and we paid down a half a trillion of the national debt.And why do you do it? Because you want job growth. If you don't have regulatory reform, common-sense regulations, reasonable tax cuts, which I have, and a fiscal plan, you won't get there. You will never be able to do it.Now, I &mdash; I inherited an an $8 billion hole in Ohio, I have common-sense regulations, I have tax cuts &mdash; the biggest of any governor in the country &mdash; and we have a fiscal plan.And it's not all &mdash; it's not always cutting. It's innovating &mdash; it's producing a better product at, frankly, a lower price. Now we have a $2 billion surplus. Our credit is strong, our pensions are strong.And, look &mdash; I've got a plan to take to Washington, and I will have it there in the first hundred days, and it will include shifting welfare, education, transportation, Medicaid and job training back to us, so we can begin, in the states, to be the laboratories of innovation.I've done it &mdash; I did it in Washington &mdash; four years of balanced budgets. No one could even believe it happened. [bell ringing] I've done it in Ohio, we're growing, the jobs are up and people are having opportunity. And I will go back to Washington and do it again for the American people. I promise you that. [applause]Within the first hundred days, we will have the plan to get this done.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, the last USA Today poll had me beating Hillary Clinton by 11 points, more than anybody on this stage. Secondly, I hope you saw tonight that executive experience really matters. It matters in terms of growing our economy, balancing budgets, cutting taxes, reforming regulations. I've done it in Washington, I've done it in Ohio, and I can go back to Washington and do it again.But I hope you also noticed tonight that I do have the foreign policy experience, not just a few years, but a lot of years in working with some of the great, great minds in this country to develop the expertise, the confidence, the firmness, the toughness and the ability to bring people together.I hope you all think about giving me your vote. I would appreciate it very much. And I tell you, we won't have to spend time figuring what we're going to do. I will hit the ground running and we will get America moving again. Thank you all very much. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, you know, , of course. I mean, if &mdash; look, I was involved in just being a pioneer in a new church. Religious institutions should be able to practice the religion that they believe in. No question and no doubt about it.Now, in regard to same-sex marriage, I don't favor it. I've always favored traditional marriage, but, look, the court has ruled and I've moved on. And what I've said, Hugh, is that, look, where does it end?If you're in the business of selling things, if you're not going to sell to somebody you don't agree with, OK, today I'm not going to sell to somebody who's gay, and tomorrow maybe I won't sell to somebody who's divorced.I mean, if you're in the business of commerce, conduct commerce. That's my view. And if you don't agree with their lifestyle, say a prayer for them when they leave and hope they change their behavior.But when it comes to the religious institutions, they are in inviolate in my mind, and I would fight for those religious institutions. And look, I've appointed over a hundred judges as governor. I even appointed adjudge to the Ohio Supreme Court.And you know what they are? They're conservatives. Go check it out. They are conservatives. They don't make the law. They interpret the law. That's all they do. And they stick by the Constitution. So I will do that.But let's just not get so narrow here as to gotcha this or that. I think my position is clear.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, you know, on the way over here, even getting ready earlier and sitting in the green room and watching the early coverage, you know, my father carried mail on his back and his father was a coal miner and my mother's mother was an immigrant, could barely speak English. And I'm standing on this stage. It's pretty remarkable. But I want to tell you, there's a lot of young people watching tonight. You can do whatever you want to do in your life. America is an amazing country, where a kid like me can grow up to run for president of the United States and be on this stage tonight. So to all the young people that are out there, your hopes, your dreams, pursue them. Shoot for the stars. America's great, and you can do it. Thank you, Wolf. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~When you talk about regime change, Wolf, it means regime change. That's what it means. Even though there's so much chaos in North Korea right now, there's a lot of reports of uncertainty, and instability in that government.But, look, here's what I think we ought to do &mdash; like, immediately. And, we've been kicking the can down the road on this for, I don't know, 15 years. We should be intercepting the ships that are leaving North Korea so they're not selling this material, or this technology, or giving it to someone else.Secondly, the same goes with the aircraft.Thirdly, we need to slap even tougher sanctions on North Korea because we really don't have the toughest sanctions on North Korea. We ought to talk about arming South Korea with ballistic missile technology. And, of course, also Japan with ballistic missile technology. Because we're now starting to take a firm position. We have the attention of the Chinese. The Chinese are the best way to calm that regime down and get them in a position of where they back off.But, when I say regime change, I don't have to talk exactly what that means. Look, I've been involved in national security for a long time. You don't have to spell everything out, but what I'm telling you is you look for any means you can to be able to solve that problem in North Korea, and in the meantime put the pressure on the Chinese. And, what we're doing is beginning to work against them.They are the key to being able to settle this situation.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Wolf, again, it would depend exactly what, you know, what was happening. What the situation was. But, if there was an opportunity to remove the leader of North Korea and create stability? Because, I'll tell you, you keep kicking the can down the road we're going to face this sooner or later.But, in the meantime, I'm also aware of the fact that there's 10 million people living in Seoul. So, you don't just run around making charges. I have put it on the table that I would leave to see regime change in North Korea. Now, perhaps the Chinese can actually accomplish that with this man who is now currently the leader, but the fact is we have to bring everything to bear. We have to be firm, and we've got to unite those people in that part of the world to stand firmly against North Korea, and make sure we have the ballistic [bell ringing] ballistic missile technology to defend ourselves.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~[inaudible][cheering]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~A deal is not a deal when you're dealing with terrorists. Have you ever negotiated with terrorists?
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Absolutely. That Apple phone didn't even belong to the killer. It belonged to the killer's employer who have agreed to allow him to try to do this. That is all they're asking them to do is to disable the self-destruct mode or the auto-erase mode on one phone in the entire world. But Apple doesn't want to do it because they think it hurts their brand.Well, let me tell you, their brand is not superior to the national security of the United States of America. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Alright [applause]   So, that's the only part of the plan? Just the lines?
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Alright, [inaudible]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Alright.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~And so you make them in China and in Russia.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~And the lines around the state. [applause]  Every night.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~And you know what they got? They got to take a picture with a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Because &mdash; and I don't know if Donald realizes this. I'm sure it's not his intent perhaps. But the position you've taken is an anti-Israel position. And here's why. Because you cannot be an honest broker in a dispute between two sides in which one of the sides is constantly acting in bad faith. The Palestinian Authority has walked away from multiple efforts to make peace, very generous offers from the Israels. Instead, here's what the Palestinians do. They teach their four- year-old children that killing Jews is a glorious thing. Here's what Hamas does. They launch rockets and terrorist attacks again Israel on an ongoing basis. The bottom line is, a deal between Israel and the Palestinians, given the current makeup of the Palestinians, is not possible.And so the next president of the United States needs to be someone like me who will stand firmly on the side of Israel. I'm not &mdash; I'm not going to sit here and say, "Oh, I'm not on either side." I will be on a side. I will be on Israel's side every single day because they are the only pro-American, free enterprise democracy in the entire Middle East. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Because at the time, Apple was portraying that the court order was to create a back door to an encryption device.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Because it is not true that I'm not going to get rid of DACA. I am going to get rid of DACA. In the Spanish interview, you just read out the transcript in Spanish, I said, it will have to end at some point. That point will be when I eliminate the executive order and the people who have those permits when they expire will not be allowed to renew it. And new people will not be able to apply. In fact, I don't even think we should be taking new enrollees in the program now.That is how the program ends and how you wind it down is you allow the people who are on it, when the program expires, they cannot renew it, and it goes away. But I will cancel the executive order as soon as I take &mdash; as soon as I step foot into the Oval Office.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Better release your tax returns so we can see how much money he made.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~But it &mdash; no, it's not a sound bite. It's a fact. Again, go online and Google it. Donald Trump, Polish workers. You'll see it.The second thing, about the trade war &mdash; I don't understand, because your ties and the clothes you make is made in Mexico and in China. So you're gonna be starting a trade war against your own ties and your own suits.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~But this is my time. I want to go back to this question you asked about the debt. This is an important issue. It's a huge issue, OK? In less than five years, 83 percent of our entire budget will be made up of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the interest on the debt.That means only 17 percent of our budget will be for things like the military or the Department of Education or environmental protection issues.You cannot balance our budget unless you deal with that 83 percent, which is why I've been repeatedly talking about since my time running for the Senate in Florida, where there are a lot of people like my mother that depend on Social Security and Medicare, on the need to save those programs, by reforming the way they work for future generations.And I think if we &mdash; the longer we take to do this, the closer we are going to get to a debt crisis. And, Wolf, you did not get an answer to your question. This debt issue is &mdash; the next president of the United States will not be able to serve four to eight years without dealing with the national debt.It is not a question of if, it is a question of when we have a debt crisis. And we should not leave the stage here tonight without hearing a serious answer from every single one of us about how we are going to deal bring the national debt under control once and for all.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Correct.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Dana, I was mentioned in his response, so if I may about the insurance companies
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Donald, might be able to [inaudible] Palestinians and Arabs, but it's not a real estate deal
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~He's done it again. [cheering and applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~He's talked through the whole thing. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~He hired workers from Poland. And he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment from
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~He thinks a Palestinian is a real estate deal.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Here's a guy that inherited $200 million. If he hadn't inherited $200 million, you know where Donald Trump would be right now?
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~His plan. That was the plan
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~How much?
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I'm sorry I was mentioned
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I'm sorry, but let me finish my
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I don't know anything about
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I just watched you repeat yourself five times five seconds ago [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I see him repeat himself every night, he says five things, everyone's dumb, he's gonna make America great again
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~In fact, some of the people [crosstalk]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~It didn't change.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Let me just say &mdash; let me finish the statement. This is important.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Many from other countries instead of hiring Americans.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Maria I was mentioned in that. I was mentioned in that statement.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Most of the lawsuits.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~No, but this is not about deportation. Everybody always goes immediately to the issue of deportation. This is about DACA. DACA is an executive order that is unconstitutional. I will cancel it on my first day in office, which means people who currently hold those permits will not be allowed to renew them when they expire, and new people will not be allowed to apply for them.Now, I am sympathetic to the plight of someone who came here when they were 2 or 3 years old through no fault of their own, but you can't solve it doing something that is unconstitutional. No matter how sympathetic we may be to a cause, we cannot violate the Constitution of the United States the way this president now does on a regular basis. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~No, he
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~No, in fact what I have said is the only thing &mdash; the FBI made this very clear 48 hours ago &mdash; the only thing they are asking of Apple is that Apple allow them to use their own systems in the FBI to try to guess the password of the San Bernardino killer. Apple initially came out saying, "We're being ordered to create a back door to an encryption device." That is not accurate.The only thing they're being asked to do, and the FBI made this very clear about 48 hours ago, is allow us to disable the self- destruct mode that's in the Apple phone so that we can try to guess using our own systems what the password of this killer was.And I think they should comply with that. If that's all they're asking for, they are not asking for Apple to create a back door to encryption.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~No, it's the same policy. It will have to end at some moment, and as I said, we will &mdash; we will eliminate that executive order. The people that are on it now will not be allowed to renew it, and new applicants will not be allowed to apply to it. And it's not because we're not compassionate to the plight of a 2 &mdash; someone who came here when they were 2 years old. I understand. I know people that are personally impacted by this.The problem with the executive order is it is unconstitutional. The president doesn't have the power to do that. [applause]And he himself admitted that.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Now he's repeating himself.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Oh, he doesn't make that money.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Oh, he lied 38 years ago. All right, I guess there's a statute of limitation on lies. [laughter and applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Oh, OK. One million.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~OK. I was mentioned &mdash; just because of the hispanic &mdash; and I'll be brief.A couple points, number one, I do think it's amazing that on this stage tonight there are two descendants of Cuban origin, and an African American. We are the party of diversity, not the Democratic party. [cheering and applause] And, the second point I would make is that we have to move past this idea that somehow the hispanic community only cares about immigration.Yes, it's an important issue because we know and love people that have been impacted by it. But, I'm going to tell you that the most powerful sentiment in the hispanic community, as it is in every immigrant community, is the burning desire to leave your children better off than yourself [bell ringing] and, you can only do that through free enterprise. That's what we stand for, not socialism like Bernie Sanders, and increasingly Hillary Clinton. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Selling watches in Manhattan. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Senator Cruz has called your immigration plan amnesty, and has an add out there comparing it to President Obama's. He says both of you support allowing undocumented immigrants legal status here in the United States after a background check, paying a fine, and paying taxes.Are those claims correct?
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~So, you're only thing is to get rid of the lines around the states. What else is part of your healthcare plan
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~starting a university, and that was a fake university.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Sure, because bankruptcy doesn't work unless you change the way you're operating, or you're going to be bankrupt again. And, the problem with Puerto Rico is it's economy is not growing. It has a massive exodus of professionals and others that are leaving to my home state of Florida, and all over the country.They're coming to the mainland from Puerto Rico because the economy there is not growing, it's too expensive to do business there. The tax rate is too high. The government regulations are too extensive.This year alone, with all the problems they're having, they barely cut their budget from one year to the next. So, I think the leadership on the island has to show their willingness to get their house in order and put in place measures allow the economy there to grow again. If the economy of Puerto Rico does not grow they will never generate the revenue to pay this debt, or the billions of dollars in unfunded liabilities that they have on their books of promises they've made to future generations to make payments.So, yes, if they do all of those things then we can explore the use of bankruptcy protection, but not as the first resort, which is what they're asking for, because it will not solve the problems on the island and you're going to continue to see hundreds of thousands of people leave that beautiful place, and coming to the mainland.They're United States citizens, they're obviously entitled to do so, and we welcome them, but we would also prefer to see a Puerto Rico that once again is growing economically, and is robust. And, the leaders in charge there now are doing a terrible job.Their previous governor, Louis Fortuno was doing a great job until he barely lost that election to [bell ringing] to someone who has taken a big government stance once again
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~That's a fact. People can look it up. I'm sure people are Googling it right now. Look it up. "Trump Polish workers," you'll see a million dollars for hiring illegal workers on one of his projects. He did it. [applause] That happened.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~that's a fake school.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~That's not an accurate assessment of what I said about ethanol. What I said is that ethanol will phase out, it is phasing out now. By 2022 that program expires by virtue of the existing law, and at that point it will go away. I don't agree with the mandate and the program that's in place, but I think it's unfair that these people have gone out and invested all this money into this program and we're just going to yank it away from them.And, again, you read the statement in Spanish. I said very clearly on Spanish television, DACA will have to end at some point, and that point is &mdash; at that time I was not a candidate for president. I said it will end in my first day in office as president, and the people who have it now will not be able to renew it. New applicants will not be able to apply. That is the end of DACA.I am sympathetic to this cause, but once again, it cannot supersede the Constitution of the United States which this president habitually and routinely every single day ignores and violates. [cheering and applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~That's what they got for $36,000.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~That's where he would be.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~That's your only plan
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~That &mdash; my point that I made was you had criticized Mitt Romney for self-deportation. You said that his strategy of self- deportation is why he lost the election.And I think people in Florida would be surprised, because, in fact, the article that was today, they interviewed a number of people that would have been willing to do those jobs, if you would have been willing to hire them to do it.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~The individual mandate. He said he likes the individual mandate portion of it, which I don't believe that should be part of it. That should not remain there. I think here's what we need to replace it with.We need to repeal Obamacare completely and replace it with a system that puts Americans in charge of their health care money again. If your employer wants to buy health insurance for you, they can continue to do so from any company in America they want to buy it from.Otherwise, your employers can provide you health care money, tax- free, not treated as income, and you can use that money only for health care, but you can use it to fund health care any way you want, fully fund a health savings account, the combination of a health savings account or a private plan from any company in any state in the country.And if you don't have that, then you will have a refundable tax credit that provides you health care money to buy your own health care coverage. And that, I think, is a much better approach than Obamacare, which, by the way, isn't just bad for health care, it's bad for our economy. It is a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off, cut people's hours, move people to part-time. It is not just a bad health care law, it is a job-killing law. And I will repeal it as president and we will replace it with something substantially better for all Americans. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~The Palestinians are not a real estate deal, Donald.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~There are people who borrowed $36,000
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~This guy always goes for
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~This is a Republican debate, right? Because that attack about letting people die in the streets
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~This is so typical.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~To comply with an order that says that they have to allow the FBI the opportunity to try to guess the password?
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~to go to Trump University, and they're suing now &mdash; $36,000 to go to a university
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~We're going to win, win win, he's winning in the polls
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~We already mentioned that [inaudible] plan, I know what that is, but what else is part of your plan
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well then, make them in America.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, can I just clarify something?
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, first of all, and before we do anything, I've been abundantly clear on this. When I'm president of the United States, before we do anything on immigration, we are going to secure the border. And, that's not just the physical border with Mexico, it's Visa overstays. That's 45 percent of the problem right there.It also has to do &mdash; that's why we need e-verify, and entry-exit tracking system, and so-forth. And, until that happens, we're not doing anything else. And then we'll see what the American people are willing to support.And Donald mentioned, because he mentioned me in his answer, that his position on immigration is what has driven this debate. Well, the truth is, though, that a lot of these positions that he's now taking are new to him.In 2011, he talked about the need for a pathway to citizenship. In 2012, Donald criticized Mitt Romney, saying that Mitt lost his election because of self-deportation.And so even today, we saw a report in one of the newspapers that Donald, you've hired a significant number of people from other countries to take jobs that Americans could have filled.My mom and dad &mdash; my mom was a maid at a hotel, and instead of hiring an American like her, you have brought in over a thousand people from all over the world to fill those jobs instead.So I think this is an important issue. And I think we are realizing increasingly that it's an important issue for the country that has been debated for 30 years, but finally needs to be solved once and for all.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, I don't know anything about bankrupting four companies. You've bankrupted..
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, I think you ask a very important question, because the issue here &mdash; the next president of the United States has to fill this vacancy.Justice Scalia &mdash; in the history of the republic, there has never been anyone better than him at standing for the principle that the Constitution is not a living and breathing document &mdash; it is supposed to be applied as originally meant.And the next president of the United States has to be someone that you can trust and believe in to appoint someone just as good as Scalia &mdash; plus there may be at least two other vacancies.So you ask Mr. Trump to respond and say that he would, and he says that he would. But the bottom line is, if you look at his record over the last 25 or 30 years, on issue after issue, he has not been on our side.Now, if he's changed, we're always looking for converts into the conservative movement. But the bottom line is that, if you don't have a record there to look at and say, "I feel at peace that when Donald Trump is president of the United States, he's going to be firmly on our side on these issues."In fact, very recently, he was still defending Planned Parenthood. He says he's not going to take sides in the Palestinians versus Israel. These are concerning things.And so, yes, I have a doubt about whether Donald Trump, if he becomes president, will replace Justice Scalia with someone just like Justice Scalia.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, in fact, I agree we should have won and I wished we would have, but, in fact, you did criticize him for using the term "self-deportation." I mean, that's on the record and people can look it up right now online.But, again, I just want to reiterate, I think it's really important, this point. I think it's fine, it's an important point that you raise and we discuss on immigration. This is a big issue for Texas, a huge issue for the country.But I also think that if you're going to claim that you're the only one that lifted this into the campaign, that you acknowledge that, for example, you're only person on this stage that has ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally.You hired some workers from Poland
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, make them in America.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, thank you for having us tonight. You know, this campaign has come a long way. It was just a few months ago there were 15 or 11 us on the stage and now it's narrowed and the votes are starting to count. And we have an incredible decision to make, not just about the direction of America, but the identity of our party and of the conservative movement.The time for games is over.I know you've had a lot of choices to make, but now it's time to narrow it down. And I'm asking you to get behind me, go on our Web site and join you our effort, marcorubio.com, so we can bring an end to this silliness, this looniness, and once again re-embrace all the things that made America and the Republican Party the bearer of the conservative movement in this country. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, thank you. This election, we have to decide the identity of America in the 2ist century, but as part of this primary, we have to find out our identity as a party and as a movement.Thirty-six years ago, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush began the Reagan Revolution. For a generation, they defined conservatism as limited government and free enterprise and a strong national defense. But they also appealed to our hopes and our dreams. Now we have to decide if we are still that kind of party and still that kind of movement, or if we're simply going to become a party that preys on people's angers and fears.I hope we remain that conservative movement that appeals to our hopes and our dreams and the belief that America will always be better in its future than it's been in its story history. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, then make them in America.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~What's your plan
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~What is your plan, Mr. Trump? [applause] What is your plan on healthcare?
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Why don't you make them in America?
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Wolf, no. I want to clarify something.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Yeah, a couple points. If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers, he'll be using illegal immigrant labor to do it. The second [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Yeah, he's going to give us his plan now, right? OK
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Yes, a couple of points. Number one, on the Libya situation, we didn't topple Gadhafi, the Libyan people toppled Gadhafi. The only choice before America that this president had to make is, does it happen quickly or does it take a long time?And I argued if it takes a long time, you're going to have rebel forces emerge like these radical Islamists to take advantage of the vacuum. And that's what happened. That's where the term "lead from behind" came. And that's the foreign policy that apparently Senator Cruz appears to agree with.On John Kerry, yes, you know why, because every day John Kerry wasn't appointed was another day Hillary Clinton was still in charge of the State Department. And she was absolutely horrible.I couldn't imagine that they were going to find somebody even worse than her, but this president never ceases to amaze. [laughter amd applause]And the last point I would make on South Korea, now this is important, because we're asking to be commander-in-chief. Donald is asking to be commander-in-chief. And he's saying these guys need to do more.South Korea contributes $800 million a year to that effort. And Japan contributes as well. And here's why our commitment to that regional security is so critical, Donald, because if we walk away from them, both Japan and South Korea will become nuclear weapons powers.They can do that very quickly. And that's what they will do if the American defense agreements wither away, which is why we have to rebuild the military, but why we can't walk away from our Asia-Pacific defense status.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Yes, tomorrow or Saturday, in fact, is our plan to release them. And there's nothing really that interesting in them. So I have no problem releasing them. And luckily I'm not being audited this year, or last year, for that matter.[crosstalk]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Yes, you've hired a thousand from another country
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~You lied about the Polish workers.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~You lied to the students at Trump University.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~You may not be aware of this, Donald, because you don't follow this stuff very closely, but here's what happened. When they passed Obamacare they put a bailout fund in Obamacare. All these lobbyists you keep talking about, they put a bailout fund in the law that would allow public money to be used, taxpayer money, to bail out companies when they lost money.And, we led the effort and wiped out that bailout fund. The insurance companies are not in favor of me, they hate that. They're suing that now to get that bailout money put back in.Here's what you didn't hear in that answer, and this is important guys, this is an important thing. What is your plan? I understand the lines around the state, whatever that means. This is not a game where you draw maps
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~You paid a million dollars.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~[inaudible]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~And &mdash; and by the way, let's be clear. [applause]Donald claims &mdash; Donald claims to care about
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~and it's something Donald does daily.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~But you're not beating Hillary. You're not beating Hillary.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~But you've never stood on this debate stage and says it works great in Canada and Scotland and we should do it here.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~But you called for Bush to be impeached.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~But you gave him a check and called for him to be impeached.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Did you say if you want people to die on the streets, if you don't support socialized health care, you have no heart.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Donald
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Donald &mdash; Donald, relax.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Donald, true or false, you've said the government should pay for everyone's health care.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Donald, you can get back on your meds now.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Donald. Donald. Donald. I understand rules are very hard for you. They're very confusing.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Excuse me, he called me a liar, then interrupted the whole time. Am I allowed to [crosstalk] [applause]Wolf, do I not get a response? Do I not get a response without being interrupted?
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Have you said you're a liberal on health care?
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~he's going to look to cut a deal, rather than fight for someone who won't cut a deal on the Constitution, but will defend it faithfully. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Hold on, I'm going to get my answer. He doesn't get to yell the whole time.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Hold on, Wolf. You said I got a response.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Hold on. He &mdash; he attacked me, Wolf. I get a response.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Hold on. He called me a liar. You're saying I can't respond to being called a liar? [crosstalk]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I believe it. No, no. I believe you know politicians much better than I do, because for 40 years, you've been funding liberal Democratic politicians. And by the way
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I don't want a Supreme Court justice that you cut a deal with Harry Reid to undermine religious liberty, because that same justice will also erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I promise you, Donald, there's nothing about you
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~I will repeal every word of Obamacare. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~If &mdash; we've got to win this election, and we can't do it with a candidate who agrees with Hillary Clinton and can't take it to her and beat her on the debate stage and at the polls.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~is because he's afraid that he will get hit.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~It's a yes or no.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~It's kind of an issue I have a long history with.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Let me tell you right now, Donald, I will not apologize for a minute for defending the Constitution. I will not apologize for defending the Bill of Rights. [applause]And I find it amazing that your answer to Hugh and to the American people is, on religious liberty, you can't have one of the these crazy zealots that actually believes in it. You've got to be willing to cut a deal.And you know, there is a reason why, when Harry Reid was asked, of all the people on this stage, who does he want the most, who does he like the most, Harry Reid said Donald &mdash; Donald Trump.Why? Because Donald has supported him in the past, and he knows he can cut a deal with him. [bell ringing]You know what, Donald [crosstalk]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~RealClearPolitics he has lost to Hillary on eight of them. In the last 10 polls on RealClearPolitics, I either tied or beat Hillary. And this is an example.You know, the mainstream media is laying off Donald now. They're going to pick apart his taxes. They're going to pick apart his business deals.And let's take, for example, one of Hillary's great vulnerabilities, the corruption at the Clinton Foundation, the fact that she had CEOs and foreign companies giving her money while she was secretary of state.The next Republican nominee needs to be able to make that case against Hillary. And if Donald tried to did it, Hillary would turn to Donald and say, "but gosh, Donald, you gave $100,000 to the Clinton foundation. I even went to your wedding."He can't prosecute the case against Hillary, and we can't risk another four years of these failed Obama policies by nominating someone who loses to Hillary Clinton in November. [applause][crosstalk]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~So does the government pay for everyone's health care?
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~So that means on Supreme Court
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~So, I've released five years of tax returns already. We will have two more years available tomorrow. And I would note that this question really goes &mdash; you know, Donald says he's being audited.Well, I would think that would underscore the need to release those returns. If he has said something that was false and that an audit is going to find was fraudulent, the voters need to know.And listen, people across this country, we recognize our country is in crisis. The most important question is how do we win the general election in November, 2016. And roughly 65 percent of Republicans think Donald is not the right candidate to go against Hillary Clinton.Now, part of the reason in the last 10 polls
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Talk away. Explain your plan, please.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Thank you, Wolf.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Thank you. Thank &mdash; thank &mdash; thank you very much.You know, it's interesting &mdash; Donald went &mdash; went on &mdash; on an extended tirade about the polls, but he didn't respond to any of the substance. He has yet to say &mdash; he can release past year's tax returns. He can do it tomorrow.He doesn't want to do it, because presumably there's something in there
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~that is bad. If there's nothing, release them tomorrow.[crosstalk]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~that makes anyone nervous.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~the reason is &mdash; you're welcome to have the check back.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~the years you're not being audited? Will you release those years?
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Then name one specific thing you've done.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~They're already prepared. The only reason he's not releasing them
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Washington deals are bankrupting this country. There are several deal-makers on this stage but there is only one person who has consistently stood up to both parties, fighting for the American people against the Washington deals.If I'm elected president, on the first day in office I will rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action. I will instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood and prosecute any criminal violations.I will instruct every federal agency that the persecution of religious liberty ends today. I will rip to shreds the Iranian &mdash; catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. And I will begin the process of moving the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.We will repeal Obamacare, abolish of IRS, secure the border, and bring back jobs. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Welcome to Texas. [applause]Here, Texas provided my family with hope. Here, my mom became the first in her family ever to go to college. Here, my dad fled Cuba and washed dishes, making 50 cents an hour to pay his way through the University of Texas. I graduated from high school at Second Baptist not too far away from here. When I ran for Senate, I promised 27 million Texans I would fight for you every day, and not for the Washington bosses.And, I'll tell you, as I travel the state, Democrats tell me I didn't vote for you, but you're doing what you said you would do. And, as president, I will do the same. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well look. We're certainly hopeful that the violence will cease, but there's reason to be highly skeptical. Russia has enhanced its position because of Obama's weakness in the Middle East, weakness in Syria. And you know, as we're headed to November, we need no nominate a Republican candidate that can lay out a clear difference with both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy.One of the real challenges with both Donald and Senator Rubio is that they have agreed over and over again with both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. So for example, in Libya, both of them agreed with the Obama/Clinton policy of toppling the government in Libya. That was a disaster. It gave the country over to radical Islamic terrorism and it endangered America.Another example is John Kerry. John Kerry &mdash; Senator Rubio voted to confirm John Kerry as secretary of State. I voted against him. And Donald Trump supported John Kerry against George W. Bush in 2004, gave him a check. And John Kerry has been the most anti-Israel secretary of State this country has ever seen. His diplomacy has been a disaster. And if we nominate someone who agreed with John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy, we're not in a strong position to win the general election. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well Maria, I would note you made the exact same point here that I made at the last debate, and you're right that Senator Rubio called me a liar for saying that. You know, we've both seen at home when Washington politicians say about an illegal, or unconstitutional program. Well, it'll have to end some day, not immediately, but someday in the future.That, inevitably, is when a politician doesn't plan to end it at all.You know, I'm reminded of that that is the same position that Marco took in Iowa on ethanol subsidies. When I campaigned in Iowa, I took on the lobbyists, took on the corporate welfare and said we should have no ethanol subsidies.Marco's position was the same as it is to illegal amnesty. Well, someday it should end, just not now. And, frankly, I think we need a president who knows what he believes in, is willing to say it on day one, not at the end of his term when it's somebody else's problem.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, as you know, at that same CNN forum, both Marco and I were asked this question. His answer, he was on both sides of the fence. He's now agreeing with me. And so I'm glad.What I said is yes, Apple should be forced to comply with this court order. Why? Because under the Fourth Amendment, a search and seizure is reasonable if it has judicial authorization and probable cause. In this instance, the order is not put a back door in everyone's cell phone. If that was the order, that order would be problematic because it would compromise security and safety for everyone.I would agree with Apple on that broad policy question. But on the question of unlocking this cell phone of a terrorist, we should enforce the court order and find out everyone that terrorist at San Bernardino talked to on the phone, texted with, e-mailed. And absolutely, Apple doesn't have a right to defy a valid court order in a terrorism investigation. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, existing law provides that those who are deported cannot come back here legally. U.S. citizens can come back. That's existing law.But let me say, Wolf, I really find it amazing that Donald believes that he is the one who discovered the issue of illegal immigration. I can tell you, when I ran for Senate here in the state of Texas, I ran promising to lead the fight against amnesty, promising to fight to build a wall. And in 2013, when I was fight against the "gang of eight" amnesty bill, where was Donald? He was firing Dennis Rodman on "Celebrity Apprentice." [laughter]And indeed, if you look at the "gang of eight," one individual on this stage broke his promise to the men and women who elected him and wrote the amnesty bill.If you look at the eight members of the Gang of Eight, Donald gave over $50,000 to three Democrats and two Republicans. And when you're funding open border politicians, you shouldn't be surprised when they fight for open borders.And I think if you want to know who actually will secure the borders and follow through, you ought to ask who has a record before they were a candidate for president of fighting to secure the borders and stop amnesty. And I'm the only one on this stage that has that record. And by the way, Marco is exactly right that a federal court found Donald guilty of being part of a conspiracy to hire people illegally and entered a $1 million judgment against him. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, Hugh, I agree with you that it &mdash; Justice Scalia's passing underscores the enormous gravity of this election. Justice Scalia was someone I knew personally for 20 years; was privileged to be at his funeral this weekend. And with his passing, the court is now hanging in the balance. We are one liberal justice away from a five-justice radical leftist majority that would undermine our religious liberty; that would undermine the right to life; and that would fundamentally erase the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms from the Constitution.Now, I think the voters of Texas, the voters across Super Tuesday are assessing everyone standing on this &mdash; this stage. In the past, Republican presidents always promise to nominate strict constitutionalists. So I'm certain if you took a survey, everyone would say they would do that.But the reality is, Democrats bat about 1,000. Just about everyone they put on the court votes exactly as they want. Republicans have batted worse than 500, more than half of the people we put on the court have been a disaster.I've spent my whole life fighting to defend the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. I can tell you, for voters that care about life or marriage or religious liberty or the Second Amendment, they're asking the question: Who do you know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, who do you know will nominate principled constitutionalists to the court? I give you my word, every justice I nominate will vigorously defend the Bill of Rights for my children and for yours. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, listen &mdash; Donald knows that it was George W. Bush who appointed John Roberts. Yes, it's true, I supported the Republican nominee once he was made.But I would not have nominated John Roberts. I would have nominated my former boss, Mike Luttig, who was the strongest proven conservative on the court of appeals. And I'll tell you, Hugh [applause] you know, it's interesting now that Donald promises that he will appoint justices who &mdash; who will defend religious liberty, but this is a man who, for 40 years, has given money to Jimmy Carter, to Joe Biden, to Hillary Clinton, to Chuck Schumer, to Harry Reid.Nobody who supports far-left liberal Democrats who are fighting for judicial activists can possibly care about having principled constitutionalists on the court.And what Donald has told us is he will go to Washington [bell ringing] and cut a deal.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, Maria, you are right. It is extraordinary that of five people standing on this stage that two of us are the children of Cuban immigrants. It really is the embodiment of the incredible opportunity and promise this nation provides.You know, I would note that a lot of folks in the media have a definition of hispanics that you can only be hispanic if you're liberal. That makes sense in the media, but I gotta tell you, one of the things I was most proud of when I ran for Senate here in Texas, I earned 40 percent of the hispanic vote here in Texas.At the same time, Mitt Romney was getting clobbered with 27 percent of the hispanic vote nationwide. And, the reason is, as you know, you look at the value sin the hispanic community. The values in our community are faith, family, patriotism.You know, we've got the highest rate of military enlistment among hispanics in any demographic in this country. And, when I campaigned, and I campaigned the same here in Houston or Dallas as I did in the Rio Grande Valley, defending conservative principles, defending judeo- Christian principals, telling my father's story.Telling my Dad's story of coming to America with $100 dollars in his underwear, not speaking English, washing dishes, having hopes and dreams for the American dream. And, the truth is the Obama-Clinton economy has done enormous damage to the hispanic community. It is not working in the hispanic community, and I [bell ringing] fighting so that everyone who is struggling in the hispanic community and beyond will have a fair and even shake at the American dream.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Well, this is another area on which Donald agrees with Hillary Clinton and on which I disagree with them both strongly. Both Donald and Hillary Clinton want to be neutral, to use Donald's word, between Israel and the Palestinians.Let me be clear. If I'm president, America will stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel. [applause]And the notion of neutrality is based upon the left buying into this moral relativism that is often pitched in the media. Listen, it is not equivalent. When you have terrorist strapping dynamite around their chest, exploding and murdering innocent women and children, they are not equivalent to the IDF officers protecting Israel. And I will not pretend that they are.Just today, Iran announced they're going to pay $7,000 to each suicide bomber. And I would note, missing from Donald's answer was anything he has done in his nearly 70 years of living defending Israel. I have over and over again led the fight to defend Israel, to fight for Israel. And this &mdash; if you want to know who will stand with Israel, we ought to start with who has stood with Israel when the heat was on. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~what he said on national television, Donald yells "liar." Let me tell you something &mdash; falsely accusing someone of lying is itself a lie
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Which years? Which years are you being audited?
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Who pays for it?
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Wolf, can I respond to that attack?
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Wolf, I'm going to ask my time not be deducted when he's yelling at me.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Wolf, Wolf, Wolf. Does everyone get to address Obamacare but me?
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Yeah, you gave me $5,000.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~Yes or no. Just answer the question.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~You've never said that?
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~You know, I actually think Donald is right. He is promising if he's elected he will go and cut deals in Washington. And he's right. He has supported &mdash; he has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrats. Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn't be hiring illegal immigrants. Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn't be funding Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi; wouldn't be funding the Gang of Eight. And, you know, he is right. When you stand up to Washington, when you honor the promise you made to the men and women who elected you and say enough with the corruption, enough with the cronyism, let's actually stand for the working men and women of this country, Washington doesn't like it.And Donald, if you want to be liked in Washington, that's not a good attribute for a president. [applause][crosstalk]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~You know, it's interesting, Donald just said that he never came out in favor of toppling Gadhafi in Libya. Well, he stated that in an interview that will be on our Web site, tedcruz.org.You can see and hear the exact words from Donald's mouth. And I assume when he sees that interview, maybe he forgot about it, but I assume Donald will apologize where he sees that he said exactly that.With regard to John Kerry, I will say John Kerry's foreign policy has been a disaster for decades. That's why I voted against him when he came up. And the fact that Donald Trump would write him a check and support him against George W. Bush shows exceptionally poor foreign policy judgment.And I'll give one more example on Israel. When the Obama administration canceled civilian air flights into the national of Israel, when Hamas was raining rockets down on them, I publicly asked, is this an economic boycott against Israel?The next day Michael Bloomberg, another New York billionaire, got on a plane, a commercial flight, and flew to Israel from London. Together the heat and light that was put on the State Department was so great that within 36 hours they lifted the ban on air flights into Israel.During that entire battle, and indeed during every battle on Israel the natural question is, where was Donald? If this is something he cares about, why has he supported anti-Israel politicians from Jimmy Carter to Hillary Clinton to John Kerry for four decades?If you care about Israel, you don't write checks to politicians who are undermining Israel. Instead you stand and support the national security of America and the alliance with Israel.[crosstalk]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~You know, Marco made reference earlier to the litigation against Trump University. It's a fraud case. His lawyers have scheduled the trial for July.I want you to think about, if this man is the nominee, having the Republican nominee [bell ringing] on the stand in court, being cross-examined about whether he committed fraud. You don't think the mainstream media will go crazy on that?And on substance, how do we nominate a candidate who has said Hillary Clinton was the best secretary of state of modern times, who agreed with her on foreign policy, who agrees with Bernie Sanders on health care, who agreed with Barack Obama on the Wall Street bailout?
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~You know, people are actually watching this at home.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~You know, the people that get forgotten in this debate over immigration are the hardworking men and women of this country &mdash; our millions of Americans who are losing their jobs. Millions of legal immigrants who are losing their jobs are seeing their wages driven down.You know, in the past couple of weeks the Wall Street Journal had a very interesting article about the state of Arizona. Arizona put in very tough laws on illegal immigration, and the result was illegal immigrants fled the state, and what's happened there &mdash; it was a very interesting article.Some of the business owners complained that the wages they had to pay workers went up, and from their perspective that was a bad thing. But, what the state of Arizona has seen is the dollars they're spending on welfare, on prisons, and education, all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars. And, the Americans, and for that matter, the legal immigrants who are in Arizona, are seeing unemployment drop are seeing wages rise. That's who we need to be fighting for.Listen, we have always welcomed legal immigrants, but I think it is a mistake to forgive those who break the law to allow them to become U.S. citizens, and that's why I've led the fight against granting citizenship to those here illegally, and that's why I will do the same thing as president. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~You know, this is another issue on which Donald and I have sharp disagreements. On Planned Parenthood, he thinks Planned Parenthood is wonderful. I would instruct the Department of Justice to investigate them and prosecute any and all criminal violations. [applause]On Obamacare, both Donald and I say we want to end it, but for very different reasons. I want to end it because it goes too far, it's killed millions of jobs, and it's hurting people's health care. Donald wants to end it because he says it doesn't go nearly far enough. And what was amazing in that exchange that was missing is for decades Donald has been advocating socialized medicine.What he's said is government should pay for everyone's health care, and in fact, a couple of debates ago, he said, if you don't support socialized health care, you're heartless. Now, liberal Democrats have been saying that for years. Now let me tell you if you're a small business owner, Donald Trump's socialized medicine, putting the government in charge of your health care would kill more jobs than Obamacare, and if you're elderly, the results of socialized medicine in every country on earth where it's been implemented has been rationing, has been the government saying, no, you don't get that hip replacement, you don't get that knee replacement, the government is in charge of your health care.I'll tell you this. As president
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Houston, Texas~February 25, 2016~You know, what we're seeing with Donald is actually the pattern of Washington &mdash; the pattern of Washington deal makers, which is they make promises, they break their words, and then when anyone calls them on it, they call you a liar.And so that's Donald's pattern over and over again. He said, for example, seven months ago &mdash; this is Donald speaking, quote &mdash; "I, Donald Trump, was a member of the establishment."There's a reason Harry Reid thinks he's the best Republican up here. There's a reason Jimmy Carter said he would support Donald Trump over me, because he said Donald Trump is malleable, he has no fixed set of beliefs [bell ringing] whereas Ted Cruz is not malleable. And every time anyone points at Donald's actual record
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~First of all, I've been talking about this for over a year. We have to destroy their caliphate because that gives them legitimacy to go ahead with the global Jihad. We have to take their energy because they are &mdash; ISIS is the richest terrorist organization there is. We have to take their oil, shut down all of the mechanisms whereby they can disperse money because they go after disaffected individuals from all over the place, and they're able to pay them. That makes a difference.As far as the command centers are concerned in Raqqa and to a lesser degree Mosul, cut those off. Do the same kind of thing that we did with Sinjar a few weeks ago, working with our embedded special forces with the Kurds, shut off the supply route, soften them up, then we go in with specials ops followed by our air force to take them over. Those are things that work.But also, you know, this whole concept of boots on the ground, you know, we've got a phobia about boots on the ground. If our military experts say, we need boots on the ground, we should put boots on the ground and recognize that there will be boots on the ground and they'll be over here, and they'll be their boots if we don't get out of there now.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~First of all, let me just complain a little bit. This is the first time I've spoken and several people have had multiple questions so please try to pay attention to that. Now, as far as monitoring is concerned, what my point is, we need to make sure that any place  I don't care whether it's a mosque, a school, a supermarket, a theater, you know it doesn't matter. If there are a lot of people getting there and engaging in radicalizing activities then we need to be suspicious of it.We have to get rid of all this PC stuff. And people are worried about if somebody's going to say that I'm Islamophobic or what have you. This is craziness because we are at war. That's why I asked congress, go ahead and declare the war .We need to be on a war footing. We need to understand that our nation is in grave danger. You know, what the Muslim Brotherhood said in the explanatory memorandum that was discovered during the Holy Land Foundation Trial was that, "they will take advantage of our PC attitude to get us. :"We have to be better than this. We have to be smarter than they are.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I've been fortunate enough to travel to 58 different countries and I thank God everyday that I was born in this country. The most exceptional country that the world has ever known. And I want to make sure that we preserve that exceptionalism for the next generation. My mother told me if I work hard and I really believed in American principles and I believed in God, anything is possible. I believe that is true, and that's why I'm not anxious to give away American values and principles for the sake of political correctness.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I think you have to ask them about that. I don't want to get in between them. Let them fight.[crosstalk]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Neurosurgeon.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~No one is ever better off with dictators but there comes a time you know, when you're on an airplane, they always say, "in case of an emergency oxygen masks will drop down. Put yours on first and then administer help to your neighbor." We need oxygen right now.And we need to start thinking about the needs of the American people before we go and solve everybody else's problems. The fact of the matter is, is that the Middle East has been in turmoil for thousands of years. For us to think that we're going to in there and fix that with a couple of little bombs and a few little decorations is relatively foolish.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Ruthless is not necessarily the word I would use, but tough, resolute, understanding what the problems are, and understanding that the job of the president of the United States is to protect the people of this country and to do what is necessary in order to get it done. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Thank you, Wolf.Please join me for a moment of silence and remembrance of the San Bernardino victims. Thank you. You know, our country since its inception has been at war, every 15 or 20 years. But the war that we are fighting now against radical Islamist jihadists is one that we must win. Our very existence is dependent upon that.You know, as a pediatric neurosurgeon, I frequently faced life and death situations, and had to come up with the right diagnosis, the right plan, and execute that plan frequently with other colleagues.Right now, the United States of America is the patient. And the patient is in critical condition and will not be cured by political correctness and will not be cured by timidity.And I am asking the Congress, which represents the people, to declare a war on ISIS so that we can begin the process of excising that cancer and begin the healing process, and bring peace, prosperity, and safety back to America. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, I definitely believe that he is unstable, and I do, in fact, believe that China has a lot more influence with him than we do. But we also recognize that North Korea is in severe financial straits, and they have decided to use their resources to build their military, rather than to feed their people and to take care of the various humanitarian responsibilities that they have.We can capitalize upon that. You know, we should use our economic power in lots of different ways. I think we can use that in order to keep Putin contained, because he is a one-horse show. Energy. And we have an abundance of energy, but we have archaic energy exportation rules. We need to get rid of those, allow ourselves to really make Europe dependent on us and other parts of the world dependent on us for energy. Put him back in his little box where he belongs.And, you know, we need to be doing lots of other things with the resources that we have. So economic power works just as well as military power, perhaps even better. And speaking of that, our Military needs to be upgraded. You know, you look at things like our Ohio Class submarines, they're 25 years old. Our minuteman 3 missiles &mdash; they are 34 years old. Our B-52 bombers &mdash; 50 years old. You know, if we don't get the military right nothing else matters.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, interestingly enough, you should see the eyes of some of those children when I say to them we're going to have to open your head up and take out this tumor. They're not happy about it, believe me. And they don't like me very much at that point. But later on, they love me.Sometimes you &mdash; I sound like him. [applause]You know, later on, you know, they really realize what's going on. And by the same token, you have to be able to look at the big picture and understand that it's actually merciful if you go ahead and finish the job, rather than death by 1,000 pricks.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, it was very interesting having an opportunity to talk to the Syrians themselves. And I asked them: What do you want? What is your supreme desire? Their supreme desire was to be settled back in their own country. I said, "What can Americans and other countries do?" They said, "Support the efforts of those who are trying to provide safety for us, including the Jordanians."Of course, they had a brand new hospital, for instance, that was unstaffed because there wasn't enough money to do it. But here's what's really neat. If you go into Hasakah province in northeast Syria, that's an area that's as big as Lebanon. It's controlled by the Kurds, the Christians and the moderate Sunnis. And there are airstrips and hotels. You could settle a lot of people there.All we would have to do is be willing to provide them with some weaponry, some defensive weaponry. And we seem to be afraid to give the Kurds weaponry. We like to send it for some strange reason through Baghdad, and then they only get a tenth of it.And if we would support them, we'd have a perfect ideal there. We don't need to set this up as we either take a bunch of refugees who will be infiltrated with terrorists, I guarantee you. For them not to be would be terrorist malpractice. And we need to &mdash; to choose the right choice, not these false choices.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, you know, the statement that I made last week, that I would leave the party was contingent upon whether in fact the party acts like they have in the past with a lot of subterfuge and dishonesty, or like they're going act now because I spike to Reince Priebus, and he assured me that the Washington Post writer had it all wrong, and that they're not be engaging in anything to thwart the will of the people.That's why I got into this race, as a member of we the people, to try bring some honesty and integrity back to the process. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, you know, there's a false narrative that only the political class has the wisdom and the ability to be commander-in- chief. But if you go back and you study the design of our country, it was really designed for the citizen statesman.And we need to be talking about where does your experience come from? You know, and I've had a lot of experience building things, organizing things, you know, a national scholarship program.One of the things that you'll notice if you look through my life is that I don't do a lot of talking. I do a lot of doing. And really, it says more about a person than how much they talk. And then some people say you're weak because, you know, you're not loud and you're not boisterous and you're not rude. But the fact of the matter is, look and see what I've done. And that speaks volumes about strength.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~You got it. You got it.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I didn't say I would cut off all communication with Putin. What I said was as president of the United States, now is not the time to talk with him. Reagan walked away at Reykjavik. There is a time and a place for everything. There is a time and a place for talk. And there is a time and a place for action.I know Vladimir Putin. He respects strength. He lied to our president's face; didn't both to tell him about warplanes and troops going into Syria. We need to speak to him from a position of strength. So as commander in chief, I will not speak to him until we've set up that no-fly zone; until we've gathered our Sunni-Arab allies and begun to deny ISIS territory; until I've called the supreme leader of Iran and told him new deal &mdash; new deal. We the United States of America are going to cut off the money flow, which we can do; which we don't need anyone's permission or collaboration to do.And I will not speak to him personally until we've rebuilt the 6th Fleet a little bit right under his nose; rebuilt the missile defense program in Poland right under his nose; and conducted a few military exercises in the Baltic states.And let us remember one other thing. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are responsible for the growth of ISIS because they precipitously withdrew from Iraq in 2011 against the advice of every single general and for political expediency. It's not these people up here. It's Hillary Clinton. [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I hope at some point you're going to ask me my strategy.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I too remember September 11th. I remember immediately putting into place security procedures all throughout our company that did business in 170 countries where we thought corporate interests would be attacked next. To take our country back, to keep our nation safe, we have to begin by beating Hillary Clinton.We need to unify our party. We need to better than our government, which 75 percent of the American people now think is corrupt and incompetent. They're right. We need to better than our politics. 80 percent think we have a professional/political class of both parties that cares more about its power, position and privilege than actually on getting anything done.We need to unify our party, we need a real Conservative in the White House, and we need to beat Hillary Clinton to take our country back and keep our nation safe.I can. I am. And together, if you join me, we will take our country back.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~It will not solve the problem.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Ladies and gentleman, this is why the American people are standing up.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Like all of you I'm angry. I'm angry at what's happening to our nation. Citizens, it's time to take our country back.Bombastic insults wont take it back. Political rhetoric that promises a lot and delivers little, won't take it back. All of our problems can be solved. All of our wounds can be healed by a tested leader who is willing to fight for the character of our nation.I have been tested. I have beaten breast cancer. I have buried a child. I started as a secretary. I fought my way to the top of corporate America while being called every B word in the book. I fought my way into this election and on to this debate stage while all the political insiders and the pundits told, "it couldn't be done."I've been told, "no,: all my life. And all my life, I've refused to accept no as an answer. Citizens, it is time to take our country back from the political class, from the media, from the liberal elite. It can be done, it must be done, join me and we will get it done. [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Sorry, but you haven't gotten to me. This is why
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~That is exactly what President Obama said. I'm amazed to hear that from a republican presidential candidate. But let's just start with, who got it wrong? Who really got it wrong?Hillary Clinton has gotten every foreign policy challenge wrong. Hitting the reset button with Vladimir Putin  recall that she called Bashar Al-Assad a positive reformer and then she opened an embassy and then later she said, over, and over, and over again, "Bashar Al-Assad must go." Although she wasn't prepared to do anything about it. Recall that Hillary Clinton was all for toppling Gadhafi then didn't listen to her own people on the ground. And then of course, when she lied about the terrorist attack in Benghazi, she invited more terrorist attacks.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~the people are fed up with the political class.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~They do not need to be forced. They need to be asked to bring the best and brightest, the most recent technology to the table. I was asked as a CEO. I complied happily. And they will as well. But they have not been asked. That's why it cost billions of dollars to build an Obama website that failed because the private sector wasn't asked. [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~This doesn't do a thing to solve the problems.. . It doesn't do a thing to solve the problems.[crosstalk]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~This is why the nation is fed up
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~We've mismanaged going into Iraq.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~We've mismanaged going out of Iraq.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~We actually
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~We have been talking about this
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, first I'll just point out that talking tough is not the same as being strong. And to wage war, we need a commander in chief who has made tough calls in tough times and stood up to be held accountable over and over, not first-term senators who've never made an executive decision in their life.One of the things I would immediately do, in addition to defeating them here at home, is bring back the warrior class &mdash; Petraeus, McChrystal, Mattis, Keane, Flynn. Every single one of these generals I know. Every one was retired early because they told President Obama things that he didn't want to hear.We must have Sunni-Arabs involved in this coalition. We must commit leadership, strength, support and resolve. I'll just add that Margaret Thatcher once said, "If you want something talked about, ask a man; if you want something done, ask a woman." [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, first, Kim Jong-Un is a dangerous leader, without a doubt. And both Republican and Democrat administrations have been completely ineffective in dealing with him. So we must continue to isolate him. We will need China as part of that strategy.China is a rising adversary. So one of the things we have to do if we want China's support is to push back on China. They, too, recognize one thing &mdash; strength and their own economic interest.I have done business in China for 25 years, so I know that in order to get China to cooperate with us, we must first actually retaliate against their cyber-attacks so they know we're serious. We have to push back on their desire to control the trade route through the South China Sea through which flows $5 trillion worth of goods and services every year.We cannot let them control the disputed islands, and we must work with the Australians, the South Koreans, the Japanese and the Filipinos to contain China. And then we must ask for their support and their help with North Korea. Because believe it or not, China is as concerned about Kim Jong-Un as we are.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~What I think we need to stand for are solutions. I offer myself as a leader to the people of this country because I think they're looking for solutions, not lawyers arguing over laws or entertainers throwing out sound bites that draw media attention. We need to solve the problem.To solve the problem, we need to do something here at home and something over there in their caliphate. We need to deny them territory.But here at home, we need to do two fundamental things. Number one, we need to recognize that technology has moved on. The Patriot Act was signed in 2001, roughly. The iPhone was invented in 2007. The iPad was invented in 2011. Snapchat and Twitter, all the rest of it, have been around just for several years. Technology has moved on, and the terrorists have moved on with it.Let me tell you a story. Soon after 9/11, I got a phone call from the NSA. They needed help. I gave them help. I stopped a truckload of equipment. I had it turned around. It was escorted by the NSA into headquarters. We need the private sector's help, because government is not innovating. Technology is running ahead by leaps and bound. The private sector will help, just as I helped after 9/11. But they must be engaged, and they must be asked. I will ask them. I know them. [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~You know, listening to this conversation, let me just say, we have a lot of argument about laws but none of it solves the problem. Let's examine what happened, why did we miss the Tsarnaev brothers, why did we miss the San Bernardino couple? It wasn't because we had stopped collected metadata it was because, I think, as someone who comes from the technology world, we were using the wrong algorithms.This is a place where the private sector could be helpful because the government is woefully behind the technology curve. But secondly, the bureaucratic processes that have been in place since 9/11 are woefully inadequate as well. What do we now know? That DHS vets people by going into databases of known or suspected terrorists.And yet, we also know that ISIS is recruiting who are not in those databases. So of course, we're going to miss them. And then we now learn that DHS says, "No, we can't check their social media."For heaven's sakes, every parent in America is checking social media and every employer is as well, but our government can't do it. The bureaucratic procedures are so far behind. Our government has become incompetent, unresponsive, corrupt. And that incompetence, ineptitude, lack of accountability is now dangerous.It is why we need a different kind of leadership in the White House that understands how to get bureaucracies competent again.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Listen, I want to talk to the audience at home for a second. If your eyes are glazing over like mine, this is what it's like to be on the floor of the United States Senate. I mean, endless debates about how many angels on the head of a pin from people who've never had to make a consequential decision in an executive position.The fact is, for seven years, I had to make these decisions after 9/11, make a decision about how to proceed forward with an investigation or how to pull back, whether you use certain actionable intelligence or whether not to. And yet they continue to debate about this bill and in the subcommittee and what &mdash; nobody in America cares about that.What they care about is, are we going to have a president who actually knows what they're doing to make these decisions? And for the seven years afterwards, New Jersey was threatened like no other region in this country and what we did was we took action within the constitution to make sure that law enforcement had all the information they needed.We prosecuted two of the biggest terrorism cases in the world and stopped Fort Dix from being attacked by six American radicalized Muslims from a Mosque in New Jersey because we worked with the Muslim American community to get intelligence and we used the Patriot Act to get other intelligence to make sure we did those cases. This is the difference between actually been a federal prosecutor, actually doing something, and not just spending your life as one of hundred debating it.Let's talk about how we do this, not about which bill, which one these guys like more. The American people don't care about that.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Not only would I be prepared to do it, I would do it. A no-fly zone means a no-fly zone, Wolf. That's what it means. [applause]See, maybe &mdash; maybe because I'm from New Jersey, I just have this kind of plain language hangup. But I would make very clear &mdash; I would not talk to Vladimir Putin. In fact, I would talk to Vladimir Putin a lot. But I'd say to him, "Listen, Mr. President, there's a no-fly zone in Syria; you fly in, it applies to you." And yes, we would shoot down the planes of Russian pilots if in fact they were stupid enough to think that this president was the same feckless weakling that the president we have in the Oval Office is right now. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~On September 10th, 2001, I was named chief federal prosecutor in New Jersey and on September 11th, 2001, my wife and my brother who are in the audience tonight went through the World Trade Center and to their offices just blocks away from the Trade Center.I lost touch with them for six hours that day and prayed that they were alive. Luckily, they were sent home. But many of our friends and others in our neighborhood lost their lives that day.Terrorism &mdash; radical jihadist terrorism is not theoretical to me. It's real. And for seven years, I spent my life protecting our country against another one of those attacks. You won't have to worry when I'm President of the Untied States whether that can be done because I've already done it. I want the chance to do it again to protect you, your children and your families.If you give me the chance and give me your vote I will protect America from the wars that are being brought to our door step.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Thank you Wolf.America has been betrayed. We've been betrayed by the leadership that Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton have provided to this country over the last number of years. Think about just what's happened today. The second largest school district in America in Los Angeles closed based on a threat. Think about the effect that, that's going to have on those children when they go back to school tomorrow wondering filled with anxiety to whether they're really going to be safe.Think about the mothers who will take those children tomorrow morning to the bus stop wondering whether their children will arrive back on that bus safe and sound. Think about the fathers of Los Angeles, who tomorrow will head off to work and wonder about the safety of their wives and their children.What is Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton done to this country? That the most basic responsibility of an administration is to protect the safety and security of the American people. I will tell you this, I'm a former federal prosecutor, I've fought terrorists and won and when we get back in the White House we will fight terrorists and win again and America will be safe. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, I think we have to focus, Hugh, on exactly what the priorities are. And to me, what I've always said is that the president has set up an awful situation through his deal with Iran, because what his deal with Iran has done is empower them and enrich them. And that's the way ISIS has been created and formed here. ISIS is created and formed because of the abuse that Assad and his Iranian sponsors have rained down on the Sunnis in Syria.And so when we empower Iran, this is why this president &mdash; and when Hillary Clinton says her theory against ISIS will be just about the same as the president, then get ready for more unrest and more murder and more violence in the Middle East.We need to focus our attention on Iran, because if you miss Iran, you are not going to get ISIS. The two are inextricably connected because one causes the other.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, what it would like is, we have one of the great advantages of America being the open society that we are. It is, we are not hiding things from the American people, but China everyday is conducting business in a way that hides things from their people.So if they want to come in and attack all the personnel records in the federal government, which they've done, and which &mdash; they now have my Social Security number and my fingerprints, as well as maybe some other folks' who are on this stage.The fact is, they need to be fought back on. And what we need to do is go at the things that they are most sensitive and most embarrassing to them; that they're hiding; get that information and put it out in public. Let the Chinese people start to digest how corrupt the Chinese government is; how they steal from the Chinese people; and how they're enriching oligarchs all throughout China.They need to understand that. And we need to take those type of steps. This president has seen personnel records of people who have sacrificed for the American people and for the federal government stolen by the Chinese and he's done nothing in return. This is why &mdash; this is what I said at the beginning that this administration, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton through their foreign policy, have betrayed the American people, because the weakness they've displayed has led to Putin's incursions in the Middle East and in eastern Europe, and has led &mdash; has led to significant problems in the Middle East as well, and the death and murder of lots of folks.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, Wolf, I'll tell you what reckless is. What reckless is is calling Assad a reformer. What reckless is allowing Russia to come into Crimea and Ukraine. What reckless is is inviting Russia into Syria to team with Iran. That is reckless. And the reckless people are the folks in the White House right now. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are the reckless people.And if you think that a no-fly zone is a reckless policy, you're welcome to your opinion. But how is it working so far? As we have 250,000 Syrians murdered, slaughtered; millions running around the world, running for their lives. It's not working. We need to try something else. And that is not reckless. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~What I say to Carla is that the first job of the president of the United States is to protect your safety and your security and the security and safety of your family. And this debate stops with me in the discussions with the FBI director.Now, listen, I'm a former federal prosecutor, I know Jim Comey. We've worked together. He was the U.S. attorney in Manhattan when I was a U.S. attorney in New Jersey.And when Jim Comey gets up before Congress and says, we cannot effectively vet these people, for me as president, that's the end of the conversation. We have to put America's security first. [applause]The American people &mdash; we on this stage need to open our ears. We need to open our ears. The American people are not whispering to us. They are screaming to us. And they're screaming to us that it's our job to actually make this government work.It's so dysfunctional under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. It's so ineffective. It's so ineffectual that the American people say, we don't trust them to do anything anymore. So I'm not going to let Syrian refugees, any Syrian refugees in this country.And it was widows and orphans, by the way, and we now know from watching the San Bernardino attack that women can commit heinous, heinous acts against humanity just the same as men can do it.And so I don't back away from that position for a minute. When the FBI director tells me that he can vet those people, then we'll consider it and not a moment before because your safety and security is what's most important to me. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Wolf, unfortunately, it's the new normal under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. The fact is that if you listen to Hillary Clinton the other day, what she said to the American people was, as regards to ISIS, my strategy would be just about the same as the president's.Just about the same as the president's? We have people across this country who are scared to death. Because I could tell you this, as a former federal prosecutor, if a center for the developmentally disabled in San Bernardino, California, is now a target for terrorists, that means everywhere in America is a target for these terrorists.Now, I spent seven years of my life in the immediate aftermath of September 11th doing this work, working with the Patriot Act, working with our law enforcement, working with the surveillance community to make sure that we keep America safe.What we need to do, Wolf, is restore those tools that have been taken away by the president and others, restore those tools to the NSA and to our entire surveillance and law enforcement community.We need a president who is going to understand what actionable intelligence looks like and act on it. And we need a president and a cabinet who understands that the first and most important priority of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of Americans.As someone who has done it, I will make sure it gets done again. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Wolf, you sit up here and you listen to this stuff, and you think that so many of these people have had so much to do in this national debate, they talk like they were bystanders. You know, we talk about our military being degraded over time, and yet we've had folks on this stage who've been a part of Congress who have participated in sequester; who participated in the degrading of this military over time.And that's why I think people get so frustrated with Washington, D.C. now. That's why they're so angry with the &mdash; the electorate is so angry with everybody who is involved in government in Washington, D.C. Because if you listen to the folks up here, you think that they weren't even there; they had nothing to do with this.This is a difference between being a governor and being in a legislature. See, because when something doesn't work in New Jersey, they look at me, say: "Why didn't it get done? Why didn't you do it?" You have to be responsible and accountable.And so on ISIS, let's be clear, the president needs to be a force that is trusted in the world. On this I agree with Marco. You know, this president is not trusted.If you're the King of Jordan, if you're a part of the royal family in Saudi Arabia and he's made this deal with Iran which gives them $150 billion to wage a war and try to extend their empire across the Middle East, why would you want to do it now?But I will tell you this, when I stand across from King Hussein of Jordan and I say to him, "You have a friend again sir, who will stand with you to fight this fight," he'll change his mind.

I know how to build, believe me, I know how to build.I feel a very, very strong bind, and really I'm bound to this country, we either have a border or we don't.

Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I know you're trying to build up your energy, Jeb, but it's not working very well. [laughter]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I really am. I'll be honest, I really am. [applause]I mean, the people have been putting me [applause]I really am. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I think &mdash; I think, for me, nuclear is just the power, the devastation is very important to me.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I think Assad is a bad guy, a very bad guy, all right? Lots of people killed. I think we are backing people we have no idea who they are. The rebels, we call them the rebels, the patriotic rebels. We have no idea. A lot of people think, Hugh, that they are ISIS.We have to do one thing at a time. We can't be fighting ISIS and fighting Assad. Assad is fighting ISIS. He is fighting ISIS. Russia is fighting now ISIS. And Iran is fighting ISIS.We have to do one thing at a time. We can't go &mdash; and I watched Lindsey Graham, he said, I have been here for 10 years fighting. Well, he will be there with that thinking for another 50 years. He won't be able to solve the problem.We have to get rid of ISIS first. After we get rid of ISIS, we'll start thinking about it. But we can't be fighting Assad. And when you're fighting Assad, you are fighting Russia, you're fighting &mdash; you're fighting a lot of different groups.But we can't be fighting everybody at one time.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I think it's very sad that CNN leads Jeb Bush, Governor Bush, down a road by starting off virtually all the questions, "Mr. Trump this, Mister" &mdash; I think it's very sad. And, frankly, I watched &mdash; I think it's very sad. And, frankly, I watched the first debate, and the first long number of questions were, "Mr. Trump said this, Mr. Trump said that. Mr. Trump" &mdash; these poor guys &mdash; although, I must tell you, Santorum, good guy. Governor Huckabee, good guy. They were very nice, and I respect them greatly. But I thought it was very unfair that virtually the entire early portion of the debate was Trump this, Trump that, in order to get ratings, I guess. In order to get ratings, I guess.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I wish it was always this easy as you, Jeb.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I would certainly be open to closing areas where we are at war with somebody. I sure as hell don't want to let people that want to kill us and kill our nation use our Internet. Yes, sir, I am.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~In my opinion, we've spent $4 trillion trying to topple various people that frankly, if they were there and if we could've spent that $4 trillion in the United States to fix our roads, our bridges, and all of the other problems; our airports and all of the other problems we've had, we would've been a lot better off. I can tell you that right now.We have done a tremendous disservice, not only to Middle East, we've done a tremendous disservice to humanity. The people that have been killed, the people that have wiped away, and for what? It's not like we had victory.It's a mess. The Middle East is totally destabilized. A total and complete mess. I wish we had the $4 trillion or $5 trillion. I wish it were spent right here in the United States, on our schools, hospitals, roads, airports, and everything else that are all falling apart. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Jeb doesn't really believe I'm unhinged. He said that very simply because he has failed in this campaign. It's been a total disaster. Nobody cares. And frankly, I'm the most solid person up here. I built a tremendous company and all I want to do is make America great again.I don't want our country to be taken away from us, and that's what's happening. The policies that we've suffered under other presidents have been a disaster for our country. We want to make America great again. And Jeb, in all fairness, he doesn't believe that.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Let me just say that I have gotten to know him over the last three or four days. He has a wonderful temperament. [laughter] He's just fine. Don't worry about it. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Let me just. Can I just finish my
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Look, look, look. We need a toughness. We need strength. We're not respected, you know, as a nation anymore. We don't have that level of respect that we need. And if we don't get it back fast, we're just going to go weaker, weaker and just disintegrate.We can't allow that to happen. We need strength. We don't have it. When Jeb comes out and he talks about the border, and I saw it and I was witness to it, and so was everyone else, and I was standing there, "they come across as an act of love," he's saying the same thing right now with radical Islam.And we can't have that in our country. It just won't work. We need strength.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Look, the problem is we need toughness. Honestly, I think Jeb is a very nice person. He's a very nice person. But we need tough people. We need toughness. We need intelligence and we need tough.Jeb said when they come across the southern border they come as an act of love.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Now, all of a sudden everybody's saying, "take the oil." It wasn't so fashionable to take the oil six months ago. I've been saying it for years.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Oh, I know. You're a tough guy, Jeb. I know.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Oh, yeah.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~OK, fine.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Our country doesn't win anymore. We don't win on trade. We don't win on the military. We can't defeat ISIS. We're not taking care of our great people, the veterans. We're not taking care of them.We have to change our whole way, our health care system is a disaster. It's going to implode in 2017, just like you're sitting there. It doesn't work. Nothing works in our country. If I'm elected president, we will win again. We will win a lot. And we're going to have a great, great country, greater than ever before.Thank you. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~So
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~So far, I'm doing better. You know, you started off over here, Jeb. You're moving over further and further. Pretty soon you're going to be off the end [crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~So, they can kill us, but we can't kill them? That's what you're saying. And as far as the Internet is concerned, we're not talking about closing the Internet. I'm talking about parts of Syria, parts of Iraq, where ISIS is, spotting it.Now, you could close it. What I like even better than that is getting our smartest and getting our best to infiltrate their Internet, so that we know exactly where they're going, exactly where they're going to be. I like that better. [applause]But we have to &mdash; who would be &mdash; I just can't imagine somebody booing. These are people that want to kill us, folks, and you're &mdash; you're objecting to us infiltrating their conversations? I don't think so. I don't think so. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Thank you.I began this journey six months ago. My total focus was on building up our military, building up our strength, building up our borders, making sure that China, Japan, Mexico, both at the border and in trade, no longer takes advantage of our country.Certainly would never have made that horrible, disgusting, absolutely incompetent deal with Iran where they get $150 billion. They're a terrorist nation. But I began it talking about other things.And those things are things that I'm very good at and maybe that's why I'm center stage. People saw it. People liked it. People respected it.A month ago things changed. Radical Islamic terrorism came into effect even more so than it has been in the past. People like what I say. People respect what I say. And we've opened up a very big discussion that needed to be opened up.Thank you very much. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~This isn't tough and easy. I wish it
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~We are not talking about isolation. We're talking about security. We're not talking about religion. We're talking about security. Our country is out of control. People are pouring across the southern border. I will build a wall. It will be a great wall. People will not come in unless they come in legally. Drugs will not pour through that wall.As far as other people like in the migration, where they're going, tens of thousands of people having cell phones with ISIS flags on them? I don't think so, Wolf. They're not coming to this country. And if I'm president and if Obama has brought some to this country, they are leaving. They're going. They're gone. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~We have to be much tougher. We have to be much stronger than we've been. We have people that know what is going on. You take a look at just the attack in California the other day. There were numerous people, including the mother, that knew what was going on.They saw a pipe bomb sitting all over the floor. They saw ammunition all over the place. They knew exactly what was going on.When you had the World Trade Center go, people were put into planes that were friends, family, girlfriends, and they were put into planes and they were sent back, for the most part, to Saudi Arabia.They knew what was going on. They went home and they wanted to watch their boyfriends on television. I would be very, very firm with families. Frankly, that will make people think because they may not care much about their lives, but they do care, believe it or not, about their families' lives. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, first of all, I think we need somebody absolutely that we can trust, who is totally responsible; who really knows what he or she is doing. That is so powerful and so important. And one of the things that I'm frankly most proud of is that in 2003, 2004, I was totally against going into Iraq because you're going to destabilize the Middle East. I called it. I called it very strongly. And it was very important.But we have to be extremely vigilant and extremely careful when it comes to nuclear. Nuclear changes the whole ball game. Frankly, I would have said get out of Syria; get out &mdash; if we didn't have the power of weaponry today. The power is so massive that we can't just leave areas that 50 years ago or 75 years ago we wouldn't care. It was hand-to-hand combat.The biggest problem this world has today is not President Obama with global warming, which is inconceivable, this is what he's saying. The biggest problem we have is nuclear &mdash; nuclear proliferation and having some maniac, having some madman go out and get a nuclear weapon. That's in my opinion, that is the single biggest problem that our country faces right now.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, I think it's very unprofessional.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, let's see. I'm at 42, and you're at 3. So, so far, I'm doing better.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, look, this is so easy to answer. ISIS is recruiting through the Internet. ISIS is using the Internet better than we are using the Internet, and it was our idea. What I wanted to do is I wanted to get our brilliant people from Silicon Valley and other places and figure out a way that ISIS cannot do what they're doing.You talk freedom of speech. You talk freedom of anything you want. I don't want them using our Internet to take our young, impressionable youth and watching the media talking about how they're masterminds &mdash; these are masterminds. They shouldn't be using the word "mastermind." These are thugs. These are terrible people in ISIS, not masterminds. And we have to change it from every standpoint. But we should be using our brilliant people, our most brilliant minds to figure a way that ISIS cannot use the Internet. And then on second, we should be able to penetrate the Internet and find out exactly where ISIS is and everything about ISIS. And we can do that if we use our good people. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, there's nothing to respond to. Well, people feel differently. I mean, the fact is Benghazi was a disaster because of Libya, everything just fell into place. It could not have been worse.What do we have now? We have nothing. We've spent $3 trillion and probably much more  I have no idea what we've spent. Thousands and thousands of lives, we have nothing. Wounded warriors all over the place who I love, we have nothing for it.And by the way  and Ben said incorrectly  and I'm not saying this as a knock  he's one of finest men. You're not going to find a finer men.But I've been talking about oil for three years. I've been saying,, "take the oil, take the oil." I didn't say, "just bomb it," I said," take it and use it and distribute it so that the wounded warriors -" People, I've been saying this now for many years.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~With Jeb's attitude, we will never be great again, that I can tell you. We will never be great again.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~You're tough.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~You better not attack [laughter]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~You can go back. You're not talking. You interrupted me.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~A little of your own medicine there, Donald.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~And it's &mdash; and we need [laughter]  to have a leader that is [crosstalk]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Ask yourself, which candidate will keep you and our country safer, stronger and freer?Hillary Clinton has aligned herself with Barack Obama on ISIS, Iran and the economy. It's an alliance doomed to fail. My proven record suggests that &mdash; my detailed plans will fortify our national and economic security. And my proven record as governor makes &mdash; will give you a sense that I don't make false promises. I deliver real results.For America to be safe and sound, I ask for you support. Thank you all very much.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Because I &mdash; first of all, I know what I don't know. I know what I don't know. I would seek out, as I have, the best advice that exists. I won't get my information from the shows. I don't know if that's Saturday morning or Sunday morning. I don't know which one. [laughter]I will seek out the best advice, and I will create a strategy and I will persuade the American people what the role of America should be. I've laid out a policy of rebuilding our military.All of the talk that we're seeing here &mdash; most of which I agree on, frankly &mdash; requires a much stronger military. We now have a lack of readiness that is quite scary. We have planes that were &mdash; that Harry Truman inaugurated, the B-52. We have &mdash; the Navy has been gutted and decimated. The readiness of the Marines is way down.If we're serious about America's leadership in the world, then we need to make sure that we have the back of the armed forces. The Armed Forces Radio is here listening to this today. I hope they know that if I'm president, I'll be a commander-in-chief, not an agitator- in-chief or a divider-in-chief, that I will lead this country in a way that will create greater security and greater safety.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Donald, this has got
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Donald, you're not going to be able to insult your way to the presidency. That's not going to happen. [applause]And I do have the strength. Leadership, leadership is not about attacking people and disparaging people. Leadership is about creating a serious strategy to deal with the threat of our time.And I laid out that strategy before the attacks in Paris and before the attacks in San Bernardino. And it is the way forward. We need to increase our military spending. We need to deal with a no- fly zone in Syria, a safe zone. We need to focus on building a military that is second-to-none
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I'm talking right now. I'm talking.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I completely agree with Chris. And this administration has been so lax. Think about it. Hillary Clinton is using a private server for &mdash; where classified information go by. This is a &mdash; this is a serious administration?The president receives an inspector general's report that the Office of Personnel Management could be hacked into; they had antiquated firewalls; 23 million files have been &mdash; are in the hands of the Chinese allegedly, including, by the way, members of the press, it turns out, last week. Maybe that's the only part that's good news, so that you guys can get a feel for what it's like now to see this type of attack.This is something &mdash; we have to have the best defensive capabilities. We need to coordinate all of our efforts with the private sector. We need to give them liability relief so that we can do that. And offensively, we need to have capabilities second to none. We need to create a situation where they know that there will be adverse impacts if they continue to do what they're doing.They'll respect that. They'll respect a United States that is serious about protecting our &mdash; our infrastructure. If we don't do it, we'll continue to see what's &mdash; exactly what's happening, not just from the Chinese, by the way. The Russians and rogue actors, including ISIS &mdash; this is a serious part of the 21st century security challenge that we face.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I do. I think the lesson's learned are that we have to have to have a strategy to get and a strategy to get out. Which means, that you create a stable situation.This president and this is what the focus ought to be, it's not the differences between us, it's Barack Obama does not believe America's leadership in the world is a force for good. He does not believe that our strength is a place where security can take place. He leads from behind. He creates an environment that now we're creating the most unstable situation we've had since the World War II era.The focus ought to be on the single fact that Hillary Clinton wants to double down on a failed foreign policy and we need to be united to defeat that because we're going to be in a place that is far less secure than it is today. Don't you all agree?
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I think we're focusing a whole
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~imagine what it's going to be like dealing with Putin or dealing with President Xi.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Look, he mentioned me. I can bring &mdash; I can talk. This is &mdash; this is the problem. Banning all Muslims will make it harder for us to do exactly what we need to do, which is to destroy ISIS. We need a strategy. We need to get the lawyers off the back of the warfighters. Right now under President Obama, we've created this &mdash; this standard that is so high that it's impossible to be successful in fighting ISIS.We need to engage with the Arab world to make this happen. It is not a serious proposal to say that &mdash; to the people that you're asking for their support that they can't even come to the country to even engage in a dialogue with us. That's not a serious proposal. We need a serious leader to deal with this. And I believe I'm that guy. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~No it isn't but it is an important subject to talk about for sure. And I think people have good ideas on this. Clearly, we need to secure the border. Coming here legally needs to be a lot easier than coming here illegally.If you don't have that, you don't have the rule of law. We now have a national security consideration, public health issues, we have an epidemic of heroine overdoses in all places in this country because of the ease of bringing heroine in. We have to secure the border.It is a serious undertaking and yes, we do need more fencing and we do need to use technology, and we do need more border control. And we need to have better cooperation by the way with local law enforcement. There are 800,000 cops on the beat, they ought to be trained to be the eyes and ears for law enforcement for the threat against terror as well as for immigration.This is a serious challenge and if we can get it right, yes, we'll start winning votes again. The real problem isn't anybody on this stage, the real problem is Barack Obama has had six years to advocate a position to fix this and he's done nothing. The congress has funded these programs of building more fencing and doing all this and he hasn't done it.He wants to maintain it as a wedge issue and so does Hillary Clinton. Republicans need to fix it and when we do, we'll be better off.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Or dealing with the Islamic terrorism that exists.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Our freedom is under attack. Our economy is under water. The leading democrat is under investigation. And America is under the gun to lead the free world to protect our civilized way of life.Serious times require strong leadership, that's what at stake right now. Regarding national security, we need to restore the defense cuts of Barack Obama to rebuild our military, to destroy ISIS before it destroys us. Regarding economic security, we need to take power and money away from Washington D.C. and empower American families so that they can rise up again.Look, America still is an exceptional country. We love to lead and we love to win. And we do it, when we take on any challenge and when we take  we support our friends.As president, I will keep you and our country safe, secure, and free.Thank you.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~September 30th you said
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~So I was &mdash; I was &mdash; I was mentioned, so I can bring up something, I think, right? Look, the simple fact is, if you think this is tough you're not being treated fairly
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~so that we can destroy Islamic terrorism.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~They are relevant if we want to destroy ISIS. If we want to destroy radical Islamic terrors, we can't disassociate ourselves from peace loving Muslims. If we expect to do this on our own, we will fail but if we do it in unison with people who are also are at risk and threatened by Islamic Radical terrorism, we'll be far more successful.Look, the FBI has the tools necessary un-American activities in our country. It goes on, we shouldn't even be talking about it, to be honest with you out in the public. Of course they have those capabilities and we should make sure that we give the FBI, the NSA, our intelligence communities, all the resources they need to keep us safe.But the main thing we should be focused on is the strategy to destroy ISIS. And I laid out a plan that the Reagan Library before the tragedy of Paris, and before San Bernardino to do just that. It requires leadership, it's not filing an amendment and call it a success.It is developing a strategy, leading the world, funding it to make sure that we have a military that's second to none, and doing the job and making sure that we destroy ISIS there. That's how you keep America safe.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~This is a tough business to run for president.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~This is another example of the lack of seriousness. Look, this is &mdash; this is troubling because we're at war. They've declared war on us and we need to have a serious strategy to destroy ISIS.But the idea that that is a solution to this is just &mdash; is just crazy. It makes no sense to suggest this. Look, two months ago Donald Trump said that ISIS was not our fight. Just two months ago he said that Hillary Clinton would be a great negotiator with Iran. And he gets his foreign policy experience from the shows.That is not a serious kind of candidate. We need someone that thinks this through. That can lead our country to safety and security. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, first of all, we need to destroy ISIS in the caliphate. That's &mdash; that should be our objective. The refugee issue will be solved if we destroy ISIS there, which means we need to have a no-fly zone, safe zones there for refugees and to build a military force.We need to embed our forces &mdash; our troops inside the Iraqi military. We need to arm directly the Kurds. And all of that has to be done in concert with the Arab nations. And if we're going to ban all Muslims, how are we going to get them to be part of a coalition to destroy ISIS?The Kurds are the greatest fighting force and our strongest allies. They're Muslim. Look, this is not a serious proposal. In fact, it will push the Muslim world, the Arab world away from us at a time when we need to reengage with them to be able to create a strategy to destroy ISIS.So Donald, you know, is great at &mdash; at the one-liners, but he's a chaos candidate. And he'd be a chaos president. He would not be the commander in chief we need to keep our country safe. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Yes.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~You're never going to be president of the United States by insulting your way to the presidency.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~You said on September 30th that ISIS was not a factor.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~He must go. It will be a blow to Iran and Russia.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I don't understand this thing about Assad. He has to go. Assad is aligned with Iran and Russia. The one thing we want to prevent is we want to prevent Iran being able to extend a Shia crescent all across the Middle East. Assad has got to go.And there are moderates there. There are moderates in Syria who we should be supporting. I do not support a civil war. I don't want to be policeman of the world. But we can't back off of this. And let me tell you, at the end, the Saudis have agreed to put together a coalition inside of Syria to stabilize that country.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~It is not the way we're going to strengthen our country. We will strengthen our country when we come together. [applause]And, look, you've got Rand Paul, you've got Ted Cruz, you've got Marco, you've got a lot of people on this stage that have studied these issues. You know what a leader does? A leader has a sound program, has a good policy, and then brings people together to solve problems. [applause]Guess what? Both in Congress in balancing the budget and in Ohio fixing the economy &mdash; and, by the way, we talk about the fence. The first thing we better get going is strengthening our economy, because if we don't have a strong economy, we can't pay for all of this. And the world wants us to be able to function from strength, believe it or not. Get our economy going, get these people together in a room. We can fix this, ladies and gentlemen. [crosstalk] We don't have to fight all the time. It can be done, and we will be great
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~It sounds more and more what my daughter said that I said in the beginning, all the fighting and arguing is not advancing us.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~No Republican has ever been elected president of the United States without winning Ohio. Let me give you a little tip on how you win Ohio, it's reform, it's hope, it's growth, it's opportunity, and it's security.The people of Ohio are the people of America. The people of America are reflected in Ohio. Our message has to be big, and bold, and positive, and connect, not just with people's heads but also connect with their hearts.If we do it, we will beat Hillary Clinton, and we will run the White House, and we will strengthen and fix America, I promise you.

John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~No, I don't think it is. And I want to go back to two other issues. One is the metadata. We know we have to hold this data for a longer period of time. And, you know, in a lot of ways, Chris is right. Look, what a president has to do is take a position. We don't want to err on the side of having less. We want to err on the side of having more. That's good for our families.In addition to that, Wolf, there is a big problem. It's called encryption. And the people in San Bernardino were communicating with people who the FBI had been watching. But because their phone was encrypted, because the intelligence officials could not see who they were talking to, it was lost.We have to solve the encryption problem. It is not easy. A president of the United States, again, has to bring people together, have a position. We need to be able to penetrate these people when they are involved in these plots and these plans. And we have to give the local authorities the ability to penetrate to disrupt. That's what we need to do. Encryption is a major problem, and Congress has got to deal with this and so does the president to keep us safe. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Thank you, Wolf. Just last weekend, just last week, a friend asked one of my daughters, "Do you like politics?" And my daughter said, "No, I don't. And the reason I don't like it is because there's too much fighting, too much yelling. It's so loud, I don't like it." You know, I turned to my friend and I said, "You know, she's really on to something."And when we think about our country and the big issues that we face in this country; creating jobs, making sure people can keep their jobs, the need for rising wages, whether our children when they graduate from college can find a job, protecting the homeland, destroying ISIS, rebuilding defense. These are all the things that we need to focus on but we'll never get there if we're divided. We'll never get there if republicans and democrats just fight with one another.Frankly, we are republicans and they're democrats but before all of that, we're Americans. And I believe we need to unify in so many ways to rebuild our country, to strengthen our country, to rebuild our defense, and for America to secure it's place it world; for us, for our children, and for the next generation.Thank you. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~The foreign policy, you have to know how to pick and choose. There's no way, if Saddam had not had weapons of mass destruction, I would have gone, because I don't believe that the U.S. should be involved directly in civil wars.I opposed the U.S. involvement in Lebanon. We ended up having to withdraw our marines after our barracks were blown up.There is a difference between Iraq, where you have Sunni, Shia, and Kurds put together after the First World War by the Western powers. It doesn't work. It needs to break up into three parts.And for the Russians, frankly, it's time that we punched the Russians in the nose. They've gotten away with too much in this world and we need to stand up against them, not just there, but also in Eastern Europe where they threaten some of our most precious allies.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, first of all, Wolf, I said last February that we needed to have people on the ground, troops on the ground in a coalition similar to what we had in the first Gulf War.I remember when the Egyptian ambassador to the United States stood in the Rose Garden and pledged Arab commitment to removing Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. Before we came out here tonight, I am told that the Saudis have organized 34 countries who want to join in the battle against terrorism.First and foremost, we need to go and destroy ISIS. And we need to do this with our Arab friends and our friends in Europe.And when I see they have a climate conference over in Paris, they should have been talking about destroying ISIS because they are involved in virtually every country, you know, across this world. [applause]Now, you destroy ISIS in a coalition. You get joint intelligence with our European friends. And then here at home, there are things called the Joint Terrorism Task Force, headed by the FBI, and made up of local law enforcement, including state police.They need the tools. And the tools involve encryption where we cannot hear what they're even planning. And when we see red flags, a father, a mother, a neighbor who says we have got a problem here, then we have to give law enforcement the ability to listen so they can disrupt these terrorist attacks before they occur.We can do this, but we've got to get moving. Pay me now or pay me a lot more later. This is the direction we need to go. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~when we join together. Thank you, Hugh.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Yeah, let me &mdash; let me just suggest to everybody, and I hear &mdash; last February, I said we needed to have people on the ground in a coalition with Europe and our allies. This is not going to get done just by working with the Sunnis. And it is not going to get done if we just embed a few people.We have to go massively, like we did in the first Gulf War where we destroyed Saddam's ability to take Kuwait. We need to have a coalition that will stand for nothing less than the total destruction of ISIS and we have to be the leader. We can't wait for anybody else. I served on the Armed Services Committee for 18 years and we must lead, or the job won't get done, unfortunately, for our country [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~You know, obviously, as president of the United States, we've got to keep the people safe. That's first and foremost.But as governor of Ohio, I have an obligation to keep the 11.5 million people in Ohio safe. And we have been very effective with our Joint Terrorism Task Force, being able to make busts.In fact, we just made one three-four weeks ago against a person who was favorable to ISIS living in Akron.But let me tell you what is interesting about the administration. We had Central American miners that were placed in Ohio, and we never knew a thing about it. We didn't know where they were. And, in fact, we know now that some of them, there is a case going on where some of them may have been human-trafficked.So when the administration tells me we have a great vetting process, the proof is in the pudding. They sent these miners to us. Our schools were disrupted. We didn't know where they were. And bad things happened to them. And now they tell me that we ought to be able to admit these Syrian refugees.So, Wolf, look, people have accused me at times of having too big of a heart. You know, that's OK. But I have to also to say I must keep the people of my state safe. So we take a pause.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~But I've answered that question repeatedly. I am personally open &mdash; after all that has happened and after ten years in that probationary status where all they have is a permit, I personally am open to allowing people to apply for a green card.That may not be a majority position in my party, but that's down the road. You can't even begin that process until you prove to people &mdash; not just pass a law that says you're gonna bring illegal immigration under control. You're gonna have to do it and prove to people that it's working.And that was the lesson of 2013. And it's more true today, than it was then. After a migratory crisis on the border with minors coming over that you're seeing start up again now, after all these executive orders the President has issued. More than ever we need to
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Dana, may I interject here?
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Did Ted Cruz fight to support legalizing people that are in this country illegally?
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Do I get another 30 seconds? He mentioned me.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Does Ted Cruz rule out ever legalizing people that are in this country now?
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~He is and so are those that voted for it. There were some that voted for it because they wanted to keep it alive and they were afraid the whole program would expire.Here's the world we live in. This is a radical jihadist group that is increasingly sophisticated in its ability, for example, to radicalize American citizens, in its inability to exploit loopholes in our legal immigration system, in its ability to capture and hold territory in the Middle East, as I outlined earlier, in multiple countries.This is not just the most capable, it is the most sophisticated terror threat we have ever faced. We are now at a time when we need more tools, not less tools. And that took we lost, the metadata program, was a valuable tool that we no longer have at our disposal.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I do. First, let's explain to people at home who the triad &mdash; what the triad is. Maybe a lot of people haven't heard that terminology before. The triad is our ability of the United States to conduct nuclear attacks using airplanes, using missiles launched from silos or from the ground, and also from our nuclear subs' ability to attack. And it's important &mdash; all three of them are critical. It gives us the ability at deterrence.Now, some have become more critical than others; for example, the submarines. And that's the Ohio Class submarine that needs to be modernized. The air component also needs to be modernized. The B-52, as someone earlier pointed out, is an outdated model that was flown by the grandparents of people that are flying it now. And we need a serious modernization program as well on our silo-launched missiles. All three are critical for the defense of the country.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I want to thank Rand for another 30 seconds, because, number one, what he's pointing to is a bill last week that &mdash; amendment that he voted for that only 10 people voted for. You know why? Because it's not focused on terrorists. It would have banned anyone from coming here. Someone from Taiwan would not have been able to come here as a tourist.Number two, this program, this metadata program is actually more strict than what a regular law enforcement agency has now. If a regular law enforcement agency wants your phone records, all they have to do is issue a subpoena. But now the intelligence agency is not able to quickly gather records and look at them to see who these terrorists are calling. And the terrorists that attacked us in San Bernardino was an American citizen, born and raised in this country. And I bet you we wish we would have had access to five years of his records so we could see who he was working with [crosstalk]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Let me be very careful when answering this, because I don't think national television in front of 15 million people is the place to discuss classified information. So let me just be very clear. There is nothing that we are allowed to do under this bill that we could not do before.This bill did, however, take away a valuable tool that allowed the National Security Agency and other law &mdash; and other intelligence agencies to quickly and rapidly access phone records and match them up with other phone records to see who terrorists have been calling. Because I promise you, the next time there is attack on &mdash; an attack on this country, the first thing people are going to want to know is, why didn't we know about it and why didn't we stop it? And the answer better not be because we didn't have access to records or information that would have allowed us to identify these killers before they attacked.[crosstalk] [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~No, no, give him time.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~prove to people that illegal immigration is under control.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Ted, do you
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Thank you Wolf.It's really amazing to be back in Las Vegas. I spent six years as a child growing not far from where we stand tonight. I use to sit on the porch of our home and listen to my grandfather tell stories as he smoked one of three daily cigars.One of the things my grandfather instilled in me, was that I was really blessed because I was a citizen of the greatest country in the history of our mankind. But there have always been people in American politics that wanted America to be more like the rest of the world. And In 2008, one of them was elected president of this country and the result has been a disaster.Today you have millions of Americans that feel left out and out of place in their own country, struggling to live paycheck to paycheck, called bigots because they hold on to traditional values.And around the world, America's influence has declined while this president has destroyed our military, our allies no longer trust us, and our adversaries no longer respect us. And that is why this election is so important.That is why I'm running for president. And that's why I'm going to ask you for your vote tonight. If you elect me president, we will have a president that believes America is the greatest country in the world and we will have a president that acts like it. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Thank you. As we near the end of this year, we enter one of the most important elections in a generation. For what's at stake in this election is not simply what party's going to be in charge. But our very identity as a people and as a nation. For over 200 years this has been a special country. A unique place where anyone from anywhere can achieve anything. But now millions of Americans feel like they're being left behind. Insecure in their future and unsafe in the face of terrorism. This election is about electing a president that will restore our economic vibrancy so that the American dream can expand to reach more people and change more lives than ever before. And rebuild our Military and our intelligence programs so that we can remain the strongest nation on earth. Tonight I ask you for your vote.If you do this, we will rebuild this country, and together we will usher in a new American century &mdash; the greatest era in the history of this great land.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~That is accurate. Three times he voted against the Defense Authorization Act, which is a bill that funds the troops. It also, by the way, funds the Iron Dome and other important programs. And I have to assume that if you vote against it in the Senate, you would also veto it as president.He has also supported, by the way, a budget that is called the containment budget. And it is a budget that would radically reduce the amount of money we spend on our military. You can't carpet bomb ISIS if you don't have planes and bombs to attack them with. And if we continue those cuts that we're doing now, not to mention additional cuts, we are going to be left with the oldest and the smallest Air Force this country has ever had, and that leaves us less safe.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~To begin with, Moammar Gadhafi and the revolt against Gadhafi was not started by the United States. It was started by the Libyan people. And the reason why I argued we needed to get involved is because he was going to go one way or the other. And my argument then was proven true, and that is, the longer that civil war took, the more militias would be formed and the more unstable the country would be after the fact.As far as Moammar Gadhafi is concerned, by the way, Moammar Gadhafi is the man that killed those Americans over Lockerbie, Scotland. Moammar Gadhafi is also the man that bombed that cafe in Berlin and killed those Marines. And you want to know why Moammar Gadhafi started cooperating on his nuclear program? Because we got rid of Saddam Hussein. And so he got scared that he would be next, and that's why he started cooperating.Look, we will have to work around the world with less than ideal governments. The government in Saudi Arabia is not a democracy, but we will have to work with them. The government in Jordan is not perfect, but we will have to work with them. But anti-American dictators like Assad, who help Hezbollah, who helped get those IEDs into Iraq, if they go, I will not shed a tear.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, he's just admitted &mdash; as he's just admitted, the reason why those refugees were allowed in was because they messed up in how they used the actual database. They should have know. They didn't because they didn't run the actual law as it exists now. It didn't work well.As far as the refugees are concerned, it's not that America doesn't want to accept refugees, Wolf. It's that we may not be able to, because this is an issue we have to be 100 percent right on. If we allow 9,999 Syrian refugees into the United States, and all of them are good people, but we allow one person in who's an ISIS killer &mdash; we just get one person wrong, we've got a serious problem.And there is not a single person in the national defense apparatus of this country that can guarantee you are going to be 100 percent right. And that's why as president, I'll take this very seriously.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, I understand why they feel that way, because this president hasn't kept us safe. The problem is we had an attack in San Bernardino. And we were paying attention to the most important issue we have faced in a decade since 9/11, and then all the talk was about this proposal, which isn't going to happen.But this is what's important to do is we must deal frontally with this threat of radical Islamists, especially from ISIS. This is the most sophisticated terror group that has ever threatened the world or the United States of America. They are actively recruiting Americans. The attacker in San Bernardino was an American citizen, born and raised in this country. He was a health inspector; had a newborn child and left all that behind to kill 14 people.We also understand that this is a group that's growing in its governance of territory. It's not just Iraq and Syria. They are now a predominant group in Libya. They are beginning to pop up in Afghanistan. They are increasingly involved now in attacks in Yemen. They have Jordan in their sights.This group needs to be confronted with serious proposals. And this is a very significant threat we face. And the president has left us unsafe. He spoke the other night to the American people to reassure us. I wish he hadn't spoken at all. He made things worse. Because what he basically said was we are going to keep doing what we're doing now, and what we are doing now is not working. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, let me begin by saying that we have to understand who ISIS is. ISIS is a radical Sunni group. They cannot just be defeated through air strikes. Air strikes are a key component of defeating them, but they must be defeated on the ground by a ground force. And that ground force must be primarily made up of Sunni Arabs themselves, Sunni Arabs that reject them ideologically and confront them militarily.We will have to embed additional American special operators alongside them to help them with training, to help them conduct special missions, and to help improve the air strikes. The air strikes are important, but we need to have an air force capable of it. And because of the budget cuts we are facing in this country, we are going to be left with the oldest and the smallest Air Force we have ever had. We have to reverse those cuts, in addition to the cuts to our Navy and in addition to the cuts to our Army, as well.And beyond that, I would say we must win the information war against ISIS. Every war we have ever been involved in has had a propaganda informational aspect to it. ISIS is winning the propaganda war. They are recruiting people, including Americans, to join them, with the promise that they are joining this great apocalyptic movement that is going to defeat the West. We have to show what life is really like in ISIS territory, and we have to show them why ISIS is not invincible, by going out and conducting these attacks and publicizing them to those who they recruit.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, they most certainly will have to be worked on to provide more than what they are doing now. There's no doubt about it. And there's one &mdash; one major reason why they have not been willing to be a broader part of the coalition, and that is they have lost complete trust and confidence in this president. This president cut a deal with their moral enemy, the Shia, in Iran. And this is the reason why they no longer trust this president and are willing to work alongside them.But they have as much invested in this as we do. In fact, more so, for it is the king of Saudi Arabia they want to behead first. It's the king of Jordan that they want to dethrone. It's the &mdash; they want to go into Egypt the way they've already gone into Libya.And on another point that we need to talk about, Assad is one of the main reasons why ISIS even exists to begin with. Assad is a puppet of Iran. And he has been so brutal toward the Sunni within Syria that he created the space that led to the people of Syria themselves to stand up and try to overthrow him. That led to the chaos which allowed ISIS to come in and take advantage of that situation and grow more powerful.And the fact that this president led from behind meant there were no alternative groups on the ground to be empowered, leaving ISIS with the prime operating space they needed to become the force they have now become.[crosstalk]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Would you rule it out?
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Yeah, a couple points. In 2013 we had never faced a crisis like the Syrian refugee crisis now. Up until that point, a refugee meant someone fleeing oppression, fleeing Communism like it is in my community.As far as Ted's record, I'm always puzzled by his attack on this issue. Ted, you support legalizing people who are in this country illegally. Ted Cruz supported a 500-percent increase in the number of H-1 visas, the guest workers that are allowed into this country, and Ted supports doubling the number of green cards.So I think what's important for us to understand and there is a way forward on this issue that we an bring our country together on. And while I'm president I will do it. And it will begin by bringing illegal immigration under control and proving to the American people.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Yeah. Immigration is not an issue that I read about in the newspaper or watch a documentary on PBS or CNN. It's an issues I've lived around my whole life. My family are immigrants. My wife's family are immigrants. All of my neighbors are immigrants.I see every aspect of this problem. The good, the bad, and the ugly. And here's what we learned in 2013. The American people don't trust the Federal Government to enforce our immigration laws, and we will not be able to do anything on immigration until we first prove to the American people that illegal immigration is under control. And we can do that. We know what it takes to do that.It takes at least 20,000 more additional border agents. It takes completing those 700 miles of fencing. It takes a mandatory e-verify system and a mandatory entry/exit tracking system to prevent overstays. After we have done that, the second thing we have to do is reform and modernize the legal immigration system. And after we have done those two things, I think the American people are gonna be reasonable with what do you do with someone who has been in this country for 10 or 12 years who hasn't otherwise violated our laws &mdash; because if they're a criminal they can't stay. They'll have to undergo a background check, pay a fine, start paying taxes. And ultimately, they'll given a work permit and that's all they're gonna be allowed to have for at least 10 years. But you can't get to that third step until you have done the other two things, and that was the lesson we learned in 2013. There is no trust that the Federal Government will enforce the law. They will not support you until you see it done first.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Yes, let me &mdash; three points of distinction. The first is, if you're an American citizen and you decide to join up with ISIS, we're not going to read you your Miranda rights. You're going to be treated as an enemy combatant, a member of an army attacking this country. [applause]Number two, we do need our defense capabilities. It is a fact that the cuts we are facing today and the cuts that Senator Cruz would have supported would leave us with an even smaller Air Force and a smaller Navy than the one we are going to be left with.And the final point that I would make is Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's strategy is to lead from behind. It sounds like what he is outlining is not to lead at all. We cannot continue to outsource foreign policy. We must lead. We are the most powerful nation in the world. We need to begin to act like it, again. [applause]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I think deserves a little more attention.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I think that by arming the allies of ISIS, the Islamic rebels against Assad, that we created a safe space or made that space bigger for ISIS to grow. I think those who have wanted regime change have made a mistake. When we toppled Gadhafi in Libya, I think that was a mistake. I think ISIS grew stronger, we had a failed state, and we were more at risk.I'd like to also go back to, though, another question, which is, is Donald Trump a serious candidate? The reason I ask this is, if you're going to close the Internet, realize, America, what that entails. That entails getting rid of the First amendment, OK? It's no small feat.If you are going to kill the families of terrorists, realize that there's something called the Geneva Convention we're going to have to pull out of. It would defy every norm that is America. So when you ask yourself, whoever you are, that think you're going to support Donald Trump, think, do you believe in the Constitution? Are you going to change the Constitution? [applause]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I think that if you believe in regime change, you're mistaken. In 2013, we put 600 tons of weapons &mdash; us, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar &mdash; into the war against Assad. By pushing Assad back, we did create a safe space.We had people coming to our Foreign Relations Committee and saying, "Oh, we need to arm the allies of Al Qaida." They are still saying this. It is a crazy notion. This is the biggest debate we should be having tonight is is regime change a good idea; has it been a good idea.There are still people &mdash; the majority on the stage, they want to topple Assad. And then there will be chaos, and I think ISIS will then be in charge of Syria.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~If I was mentioned in the question, can I respond?
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Marco still misunderstands the immigration issue. What I put forward was an amendment that would have temporarily halted immigration from high-risk terrorist countries, but would have started it up, but I wanted them to go through Global Entry, which is a program where we do background checks.The thing is, is that every terrorist attack we've had since 9/11 has been legal immigration. Marco wants to expand that. I want more rules, more scrutiny, and to defend the country, you have to defend the border. [applause]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~No, I think it's a huge mistake. I think regime change in Syria, and this is what &mdash; I've been saying this for several years now. In 2013 when we first went in, I said, you are going to give arms to the allies of al Qaida, to radical jihadists? That's crazy.But the other thing I said is the great irony is you will be back fighting against your own weapons. Had Assad been bombed when he used chemical weapons two years ago, ISIS would be in charge of all of Syria now.We have to have a more realistic foreign policy and not a utopian one where we say, oh, we're going to spread freedom and democracy, and everybody in the Middle East is going to love us. They are not going to love us. [applause][crosstalk]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~The greatest threat to our national security is our debt. We borrow a million dollars a minute. And whose fault is it? Well, frankly, it's both parties' fault. You have those on the right who clamor and say, oh, we will spend anything on the military, and those on the left who say the same for domestic welfare.But what most Americans don't realize is there is an unholy alliance. They come together. There's a secret handshake. We spend more money on everything. And we are not stronger nation if we go further into debt. We are not projecting power from bankruptcy court.To me, there is no greater threat than our debt. I'm the only fiscal conservative on the stage because I'm willing to hold the line on all spending. I hope you will consider me in the election. Thank you very much. [applause]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~The question is, how do we keep America safe from terrorism? Trump says we ought to close that Internet thing. The question really is, what does he mean by that? Like they do in North Korea? Like they do in China?Rubio says we should collect all Americans' records all of the time. The Constitution says otherwise. I think they're both wrong. I think we defeat terrorism by showing them that we do not fear them. I think if we ban certain religions, if we censor the Internet, I think that at that point the terrorists will have won. Regime change hasn't won. Toppling secular dictators in the Middle East has only led to chaos and the rise of radical Islam. I think if we want to defeat terrorism, I think if we truly are sincere about defeating terrorism, we need to quit arming the allies of ISIS. If we want to defeat terrorism, the boots on the ground &mdash; the boots on the ground need to be Arab boots on the ground.As commander-in-chief, I will do whatever it takes to defend America. But in defending America, we cannot lose what America stands for. Today is the Bill of Rights' anniversary. I hope we will remember that and cherish that in the fight on terrorism.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~These are the fundamental questions of our time, these foreign policy questions, whether or not regime change is a good idea or a bad idea. I don't think because I think the regime change was a bad idea it means that Hussein was necessarily a good idea.There is often variations of evil on both sides of the war. What we have to decide is whether or not regime change is a good idea. It's what the neoconservatives have wanted. It's what the vast majority of those on the stage want.They still want regime change. They want it in Syria. They wanted it in Iraq. They want it in Libya. It has not worked.Out of regime change you get chaos. From the chaos you have seen repeatedly the rise of radical Islam. So we get this profession of, oh, my goodness, they want to do something about terrorism and yet they're the problem because they allow terrorism to arise out of that chaos. [applause]

My goodness, what we want in a leader is someone with judgment, not someone who is so reckless as to stand on the stage and say, "Yes, I'm jumping up and down; I'm going to shoot down Russian planes." Russia already flies in that airspace. It may not be something we're in love with the fact that they're there, but they were invited by Iraq and by Syria to fly in that airspace.And so if we announce we're going to have a no-fly zone, and others have said this. Hillary Clinton is also for it. It is a recipe for disaster. It's a recipe for World War III. We need to confront Russia from a position of strength, but we don't need to confront Russia from a point of recklessness that would lead to war.This is something &mdash; this type of judgment, you know, it's having that kind of judgment; who you would appoint and how you're going to conduct affairs, that is incredibly important.I mean, I think when we think about the judgment of someone who might want World War III, we might think about someone who might shut down a bridge because they don't like their friends; they don't want to &mdash; you know, they want to [inaudible] a Democrat.So I think we need to be very careful.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~What my bill would do would be only for refugees going forward. So I haven't taken a position on sending anyone home. But I have taken the position that we have a lot of problems here in our country. And that one of the things that we do &mdash; charity is about giving your own money. Charity isn't giving someone else's money. To put everyone in government housing and food stamps and bring them in from around the world I think is a mistake. To give of your own money, I've given to my church. My church has helped people that came from Bosnia. That's a good thing.But we shouldn't have a program where we just say that we're going to take care of the world's refugees. Nobody in the Middle East is doing anything. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait &mdash; all the Gulf nations are doing nothing. They need to step up and take [crosstalk] [applause]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Wolf
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Wolf, this legislation
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~You know, I think Marco gets it completely wrong. We are not any safer through the bulk collection of all Americans' records. In fact, I think we're less safe. We get so distracted by all of the information, we're not spending enough time getting specific immigration &mdash; specific information on terrorists.The other thing is, is the one thing that might have stopped San Bernardino, that might have stopped 9/11 would have been stricter controls on those who came here. And Marco has opposed at every point increased security &mdash; border security for those who come to our country.On his Gang of Eight bill, he would have liberalized immigration, but he did not &mdash; and he steadfastly opposed any new border security requirements for refugees or students.Last week, I introduced another bill saying we need more security, we need more scrutiny. Once again, Marco opposed this. So Marco can't have it both ways. He thinks he wants to be this, "Oh, I'm great and strong on national defense." But he's the weakest of all the candidates on immigration. He is the one for an open border that is leaving us defenseless. If we want to defend the country, we have to defend against who's coming in, and Marco is &mdash; has more of an allegiance to Chuck Schumer and to the liberals than he does to conservative policy. [applause]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~You know, I think we need to set the record straight on this, because I think Marco misspoke about the bill. On the Gang of Eight bill, there was no provisions really for extra scrutiny or safety for refugees. At the time the bill came up, two Iraqi refugees came to my home town, Bowling Green, Kentucky. Their fingerprints were on a bomb from Iraq. They were in the database, but we didn't pick them up.We relocated them here, put them in government housing, got them on food stamps. And we began providing for them, but we didn't have adequate security. On the Gang of Eight bill, on Marco's bill, we had an opportunity. There was a conservative consensus for an amendment I put forward called Trust, But Verify that would have strengthened border security on both refugees, students and those coming here. And Marco sided and I guess was more sympathetic to Chuck Schumer and to the president than he was to conservative principles.But this goes directly to national defense. And if he wants to run as a national &mdash; national defense conservative, he's got to explain why he hasn't stepped up to support border security.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~a regime we should change is Iran
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~And I will do everything necessary to keep our children safe.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~And there is a real danger, Dana, when people get distracted.I'm answering the question, Wolf.There's a real danger when people get distracted by peripheral issues. They get distracted by democracy building. They get distracted about military conflicts. We need to focus on defeating jihadism. ISIS and Iran have declared war on America, and we need a commander in chief who will do everything necessary to keep our children safe.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~And we need to be focused on defeating
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~because Iran has declared war on us. But we shouldn't be toppling regimes [crosstalk]  that are fighting radical Islamic terrorists that are helping
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~But more broadly, you know, the notion Marco is suggesting, that somehow &mdash; he also has tossed more than a few insults this direction &mdash; let's be absolutely clear. ISIS and radical Islamic terrorism will face no more determined foe than I will be.We will utterly destroy them by targeting the bad guys. And one of the problems with Marco's foreign policy is he has far too often supported Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama undermining governments in the Middle East that have helped radical Islamic terrorists.We need to focus on killing the bad guys, not getting stuck in Middle Eastern civil wars that don't keep America safe.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Dana, what I said in private is exactly what I'll say here, which is that the judgment that every voter is making of every one of us up here is who has the experience, who has the vision, who has the judgment to be commander in chief. That is the most important decision for the voters to make. That's a standard I'm held to. And it's a standard everyone else is held to.And I will note, you know, in the whole course of this discussion about our foreign policy threats, it actually illustrates the need for clarity of focus.You know, my daughters, Caroline and Catherine, came tonight. They're 7 and 5. And you think about the Los Angeles schools canceling their schools today.And every parent is wondering, how do we keep our kids safe? We need a commander in chief who does what Ronald Reagan did with communism, which is he set out a global strategy to defeat Soviet communism. And he directed all of his [crosstalk]I'm answering the question, Dana.He directed all of his forces to defeating communism.One of the things we've seen here is how easy it is for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to get distracted from dealing with radical Islamic terrorism. They won't even call it by its name.We need a president who stands up, number one, and says, we will defeat ISIS. And number two, says the greatest national security threat facing America is a nuclear Iran.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~defeating radical Islamic terrorists.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~go in the fight against amnesty
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~He campaigned promising to lead the fight against amnesty.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I have never supported a legalization
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~I have never supported legalization, and I do not intend to support legalization. Let me tell you how you do this, what you do is you enforce the law [crosstalk]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~In Florida promising to [crosstalk]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Judgment, strength, clarity and trust. Barack Obama has said he doesn't believe in American leadership or America winning &mdash; he is wrong. America can win again and we will win again. Ronald Reagan reignited the American economy, rebuilt the Military, bankrupted the Soviet Union and defeated Soviet Communism. I will do the same thing.Cutting taxes, cutting regulation, unleashing small businesses and rebuilding the Military to defeat radical Islamic terrorism &mdash; our strategy is simple. We win, they lose. We've done it before and we can do it again.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Look, I understand Marco wants to raise confusion, it is not accurate what he just said that I supported legalization. Indeed, I led the fight against his legalization and amnesty. And you know, there was one commentator that put it this way that, for Marco to suggest our record's the same is like suggesting "the fireman and the arsonist because they are both at the scene of the fire."He was fighting to grant amnesty and not to secure the border, I was fighting to secure the border. And this also goes to trust, listening on to campaign trails. Candidates all the time make promises. You know, Marco said," he learned that the American people didn't trust the federal government."
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~on defeating our enemies. So, for example
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Thank you, Wolf.America is at war. Our enemy is not violent extremism. It is not some unnamed malevolent force. It is radical Islamic terrorist. We have a president who is unwilling to utter its name. The men and women on this stage, every one of us, is better prepared to keep this nation safe than is Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton.We need a president who understands the first obligation of the commander-in-chief is to keep America safe. If I am elected president, we will hunt down and kill the terrorists. We will utterly destroy ISIS.We will stop the terrorist attacks before they occur because we will not be prisoners to political correctness. Rather, we will speak the truth. Border security is national security and we will not be admitting jihadists as refugees.We will keep America safe. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~The question of whether we should toppling dictatorships is asking the wrong question. We should be defeating our enemies. So the problem with defeating
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Watt you do is enforcement the law
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~we ought to hunt down our enemies and kill ISIS rather than creating opportunities for ISIS to take control of new countries.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, but let me explain, the focus should be
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, Dana, the premise of your question is not accurate. I'm very proud to have joined with conservatives in both the Senate and the House to reform how we target bad guys.And what the USA Freedom Act did is it did two things. Number one, it ended the federal government's bulk collection of phone metadata of millions of law-abiding citizens.But number two in the second half of it that is critical. It strengthened the tools of national security and law enforcement to go after terrorists. It gave us greater tools and we are seeing those tools work right now in San Bernardino.And in particular, what it did is the prior program only covered a relatively narrow slice of phone calls. When you had a terrorist, you could only search a relatively narrow slice of numbers, primarily land lines.The USA Freedom Act expands that so now we have cell phones, now we have Internet phones, now we have the phones that terrorists are likely to use and the focus of law enforcement is on targeting the bad guys.You know what the Obama administration keeps getting wrong is whenever anything bad happens they focus on law-abiding citizens instead of focusing on the bad guys.We need to focus on radical Islamic terrorists and we need to stop them before they carry out acts of terror. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, he &mdash; he has attempted to muddy the waters, but I think that anyone who watched the battle that we had. You know, there was a time for choosing as Reagan put it. Where there was a battle over amnesty and some chose, like Senator Rubio to stand with Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer and support a massive amnesty plan.Others chose to stand with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and the American people and secure the border.And let me mention, this issue is actually directly connected to what we've been talking about. Because the front line with ISIS isn't just in Iraq and Syria, it's in Kennedy Airport and the Rio Grande. Border security is national security. And, you know, one of the most troubling aspects of the Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight Bill was that it gave President Obama blanket authority to admit refugees, including Syrian refugees without mandating any background checks whatsoever. Now we've seen what happened in San Bernardino. When you are letting people in, when the FBI can't vet them, it puts American citizens at risk. And I tell you, if I'm elected president, we will secure the border. We will triple the border patrol. We will build a wall that works and I'll get Donald Trump to pay for it. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, it's more than not shedding a tear. It's actively getting involved to topple a government. And we keep hearing from President Obama and Hillary Clinton and Washington Republicans that they're searching for these mythical moderate rebels. It's like a purple unicorn. They never exist. These moderate rebels end up being jihadists.And I'll tell you whose view on Assad is the same as mine. It's Prime Minister Netanyahu. Prime Minister Netanyahu has said Israel doesn't have a dog in that fight because Assad is a puppet of Iran, a Shia radical Islamic terrorist, but at the same time, Prime Minister Netanyahu doesn't want to see Syria governed by ISIS. And we need to focus on American interests, not on global aspirations [crosstalk]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, listen, Hugh, everyone understands why Donald has suggested what he has. We're looking at a president who's engaged in this double-speak where he doesn't call radical Islamic terrorism by its name. Indeed, he gives a speech after the San Bernardino attack where his approach is to try to go after the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens rather than to keep us safe.And even worse, President Obama and Hillary Clinton are proposing bringing tens of thousands of Syrian refugees to this country when the head of the FBI has told Congress they cannot vet those refugees.I understand why Donald made that proposal. I introduced legislation in the Senate that I believe is more narrowly focused at the actual threat, which is radical Islamic terrorism, and what my legislation would do is suspend all refugees for three years from countries where ISIS or Al Qaida control substantial territory.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, you know, I'm reminded of what FDR's grandfather said. He said, "All horse-thieves are Democrats, but not all Democrats are horse-thieves." [laughter]In this instance, there are millions of peaceful Muslims across the world, in countries like India, where there is not the problems we are seeing in nations that are controlled &mdash; have territory controlled by Al Qaida or ISIS, and we should direct at the problem, focus on the problem, and defeat radical Islamic terrorism. It's not a war on a faith; it's a war on a political and theocratic ideology that seeks to murder us.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, you know, I would note that Marco knows what he's saying isn't true. You know, Mark Levin wrote a column last week that says that the attack ads his Super PAC is running that are saying the same thing, that they are knowingly false and they are, in fact, Alinsky-like attacks like Barack Obama.And the reason is simple. What he knows is that the old program covered 20 percent to 30 percent of phone numbers to search for terrorists. The new program covers nearly 100 percent. That gives us greater ability to stop acts of terrorism, and he knows that that's the case.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Well, you know, Marco has continued these attacks, and he knows they're not true. Yes, it is true that I voted against the National Defense Authorization Act, because when I campaigned in Texas I told voters in Texas that I would oppose the federal government having the authority to detain U.S. citizens permanently with no due process. I have repeatedly supported an effort to take that out of that bill, and I honored that campaign commitment.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~What I'm saying, Dana, is that is a judgment for every voter to make. What I can tell you is all nine of the people here would make an infinitely better commander in chief than Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~What it means is using overwhelming air power to utterly and completely destroy ISIS. To put things in perspective, in the first Persian Gulf War, we launched roughly 1,100 air attacks a day. We carpet bombed them for 36 days, saturation bombing, after which our troops went in and in a day and a half mopped up what was left of the Iraqi army.Right now, Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day. It is photo op foreign policy. We need to use overwhelming air power. We need to be arming the Kurds. We need to be fighting and killing ISIS where they are.And let me go back to the earlier discussion a minute ago. It's not a lack of competence that is preventing the Obama administration from stopping these attacks. It is political correctness. We didn't monitor the Facebook posting of the female San Bernardino terrorist because the Obama DHS thought it would be inappropriate. She made a public call to jihad, and they didn't target it.The Tsarnaev brothers, the elder brother made a public call to jihad and the Obama administration didn't target it. Nidal Hasan communicated with Anwar al-Awlaki, a known radical cleric, asked about waging jihad against his fellow soldiers. The problem is because of political correctness, the Obama administration, like a lot of folks here, want to search everyone's cell phones and e-mails and not focus on the bad guys. And political correctness is killing people.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~What you do
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~What you do is you enforce the law. I've laid out a very, very detailed immigration plan on my website, tedcruz.org. It's 11 pages of existing federal law and in particular the question of what to do with people who are here now? You enforce the law.That means you stop the Obama administration's policy of releasing criminal illegal aliens. Do you know how many aliens Bill Clinton deported? 12 million. Do you know how many illegal aliens, George W. Bush deported? 10 million.We can enforce the laws and if we secure the border, that solves the problem. And as president I will solve this problem and secure the border.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~Wolf, I believe in a America first foreign policy, that far too often President Obama and Hillary Clinton &mdash; and, unfortunately, more than a few Republicans &mdash; have gotten distracted from the central focus of keeping this country safe.So let's go back to the beginning of the Obama administration, when Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama led NATO in toppling the government in Libya. They did it because they wanted to promote democracy. A number of Republicans supported them. The result of that &mdash; and we were told then that there were these moderate rebels that would take over. Well, the result is, Libya is now a terrorist war zone run by jihadists.Move over to Egypt. Once again, the Obama administration, encouraged by Republicans, toppled Mubarak who had been a reliable ally of the United States, of Israel, and in its place, Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood came in, a terrorist organization.And we need to learn from history. These same leaders &mdash; Obama, Clinton, and far too many Republicans &mdash; want to topple Assad. Assad is a bad man. Gadhafi was a bad man. Mubarak had a terrible human rights record. But they were assisting us &mdash; at least Gadhafi and Mubarak &mdash; in fighting radical Islamic terrorists.And if we topple Assad, the result will be ISIS will take over Syria, and it will worsen U.S. national security interests. And the approach, instead of being a Woodrow Wilson democracy promoter
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Las Vegas, Nevada~December 15, 2015~You would carpet bomb where ISIS is, not a city, but the location of the troops. You use air power directed &mdash; and you have embedded special forces to direction the air power. But the object isn't to level a city. The object is to kill the ISIS terrorists.To make it &mdash; listen, ISIS is gaining strength because the perception is that they're winning. And President Obama fuels that perception. That will change when militants across the globe see that when you join ISIS that you are giving up your life, you are signing your death warrant, and we need a president who is focused on defeating every single ISIS terrorist and protecting the homeland, which should be the first priority.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Can I say something
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~For many months, the political class, pundits, the media, have tried to ignore or bury me. They say that politics is too complex, and too sleazy. You can't survive. Well, guess what? I'm still here, and I'm not going any place either.And, I believe there is still a place in our country for faith, integrity, and common sense. Hundreds of thousands of you drafted me to run for president [bell rings]  And, I am going to with the help of God, and you, once again place the American people at the pinnacle with the government there to serve it. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Good evening.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~I want to say something about this, because I'm not here just to add beauty to the stage. [laughter]You know, I've been talking about Libya for quite a long time. I think I was the first one to start talking about it because I say we have to have a proactive foreign policy strategy. And of course, the next place that ISIS is going to attack to is Libya.If you want to expand your caliphate and increase your influence, then you're going to go to a place that's strategically located. You go north, across the Mediterranean. You're into southern Europe. You go south, you're into Chad and Sudan and Niger. Not to mention the fact that you have much more oil than you do in Iraq. That's the kind of place that they're going to go to, therefore, we need to be thinking about how do we prevent them from tacking over there. They're already sending their fighters there, we need to be consulting with our military experts and asking them what do they need in order to prevent ISIS from being able to take over Libya. That's going to have enormous concede for us.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~I would support the possibility of renewed airstrikes if in conjunction with our Joint Chiefs and our military people they felt that was an appropriate strategy.The fact of the matter is none of us up here is a military expert, and we sometimes act like we are, but we're not. And if we actually sit down and talk with them and get them to understand our plan and their impression of what needs to be done, I think we're going to make a lot more progress.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~It's the same question?
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Since I was mentioned
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Something about the draft. Very quickly.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~This is great you guys. I want you all to mention me when you say something. [laughter]In fact, the time line indicates that initial tweet from CNN was followed by another one within one minute that clarified that I was not dropping out. So, what happened to that one, it is unclear. But the bottom line is, we can see what happened, everybody can see what happened and you can make your own judgment.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, thank you. You know, I was hoping to get a chance to talk about North Korea. I was the only one who didn't get to do that, and I've got stuff to say about it, let me tell you.But at any rate, you have to replace it with something that makes sense. It doesn't make sense. And the reason that I dislike Obamacare is because the government comes in and tells the people &mdash; which the nation is supposed to be centered on &mdash; that we don't care what you think, this is what we're doing. And if you don't like it, too bad. That's a problem. And we can't afford to do that because that will fundamentally change America.I have proposed a health empowerment account system. Everybody gets a health empowerment account the day they are born, they keep it until they die. They can pass it on. We pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional health care with, recognizing that we spend twice as much as many countries per capita and health care and don't have as such access.We give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account so that each family basically becomes its own insurance company without a middleman; that saves you a awful lot of money. And that will lower the cost of your catastrophic insurance tremendously, because the only thing coming out of that is catastrophic health care.And then in terms of taking care of the indigent, we have another whole system, and I can go ahead and explain it, but I don't have the time, but I'd be happy to if you give me some more time. But go to my website bencarson.com, read about it. You can read about everything that's been discussed here in great detail. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, you know, it's not a simple issue, and now, you know, we've gotten evidence that there can been active viruses in other bodily fluids like saliva and urine. So, this is going to be, obviously, a big deal.Do we quarantine people? If we have evidence that they are infected, and that there is evidence that that infection can spread by something that they're doing, yes. But, just willy-nilly going out and quarantining a bunch of people because they've been to Brazil, I don't believe that that's going to work. What we really need to be thinking about is how do we get this disease under control?And this is where we need rapid response. We need a rapid response for ebola, we need rapid response for Zika, there will be other things that will come up. These are the kinds of things that the NIH, the CDC, can be very effective in. We need to give the the appropriate support for those kind of things.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, you know, when I wasn't introduced No. 2, as was the plan, I thought maybe he thought I already had dropped out. But  [applause]But you know, today is the 105th anniversary, or &mdash; 105th birthday of Ronald Reagan. His 11 Commandment was not to speak ill of another Republican. So, I'm not going to use this opportunity to savage the reputation of Senator Cruz. [applause]But I will say &mdash; I will say &mdash; I will say that I was very disappointed that members of his team thought so little of me that they thought that after having hundreds, if not thousands of volunteers and college students who sacrificed their time and were dedicated to the cause &mdash; one even died &mdash; to think that I would just walk away ten minutes before the caucus and say, "Forget about you guys."I mean, who would do something like that? Now, I don't think anyone on this stage would do something like that. And to assume that someone would, what does that tell you? So, unfortunately, it did happen.It gives us a very good example of certain types of Washington ethics. Washington ethics. Washington ethics basically says, if it's legal, you do what you need to do in order to win. That's not my ethics. My ethics is, you do what's right.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~With 100 percent certainly, I will predict the winner &mdash; it will either be Denver or Carolina.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Yes. Well, first of all, I think it would be a pretty easy contrast, quite frankly, between myself and Hillary Clinton. In one case, you have someone who is known as a deceitful individual. An individual who at Benghazi, which I will never let go, quite frankly, because I think of those two men who went up there on the top of that compound with machine guns, firing away, allowing their colleagues to escape.And I'm sure, in the back of their mind, they were just saying, if we can just hold on, help is on the way. But help was not on the way. When did we in the United States not send people to help our own people? You know, this is not who we are. [applause]And &mdash; I would simply make it a referendum on honesty and integrity versus deceit and the Washington way.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~You know, 14 percent decrease in the number of people applying for voluntary military service, and I think part of it is because of the way that we treat our veterans. You know, we wouldn't be a free country if it wasn't for them, and we have 22 veterans per day committing suicide.So, I think what we should do is have an external support system for people once they volunteer and it should follow them throughout their career, should follow them for three years, five years afterwards, a year before they get out, should be working on integrating them back into society, so that they quit on Friday and they start their new job. They should have health empowerment accounts that are subsidized so they can go to any medical facility and be taken care of. They can go to a V.A. if they want to.But if we start taking care of our veterans the right way, we won't have to ever worry about a draft again. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~And the fact is, I went back, it got done and here's
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Can I &mdash; can I be really &mdash; can I be really clear on this, because I am the father of two daughters. One of them is here tonight. What my wife and I have taught our daughters right from the beginning, that their sense of self-worth, their sense of value, their sense of what they want to do with their life comes not from the outside, but comes from within. And if a young woman in this country wants to go and fight to defend their country, she should be permitted to do so.Part of that also needs to be part of a greater effort in this country, and so there's no reason why one &mdash; young women should be discriminated against from registering for the selective service. The fact is, we need to be a party and a people that makes sure that our women in this country understand anything they can dream, anything that they want to aspire to, they can do. That's the way we raised our daughters and that's what we should aspire to as president for all of the women in our country. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~David? Hey, David? David? Hey, David? I actually have experience with raising taxes on millionaires in my state. It was done. It was done by my predecessor.And I want everybody in the public who is in that 68 percent, I want to tell you the truth. You're wrong. And here is why you're wrong. After New Jersey raised taxes on millionaires, we lost, in the next four years, $70 billion in wealth left our state.It left our state to go where it would be treated more kindly. If the United States raised taxes any further, that money will leave the United States, as well. We won't have better jobs.Let New Jersey be the canary in the coal mine. It is a failed idea and a failed policy, it's class warfare. It happened in my state. I've stopped it from happening again. But we cannot do it.The 68 percent of the people are wrong about that, it will hurt the American economy. We tried it in New Jersey. Come take a look &mdash; it did not work. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Denver.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Excuse me
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Good evening.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Hold on one second.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~I think he mentioned me and my record in there, so I think I get a chance to respond. You see, everybody, I want the people at home to think about this. That's what Washington, D.C. Does. The drive-by shot at the beginning with incorrect and incomplete information and then the memorized 25-second speech that is exactly what his advisers gave him. [applause]See Marco &mdash; Marco, the thing is this. When you're president of the United States, when you're a governor of a state, the memorized 30-second speech where you talk about how great America is at the end of it doesn't solve one problem for one person. They expect you to plow the snow. They expect you to get the schools open. And when the worst natural disaster in your state's history hits you, they expect you to rebuild their state, which is what I've done.None of that stuff happens on the floor of the United States Senate. It's a fine job, I'm glad you ran for it, but it does not prepare you for president of the United States. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~It gets very unruly when he gets off his talking points.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Let's get something
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Martha?
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~No. Let's make something very clear. I learned seven years as a federal prosecutor in dealing with types of situations like we're talking about in North Korea, where criminals take people hostage. You never pay ransom to the criminals. Ever. You never pay ransom to the criminals. Everyone out at home watching tonight understands that principle.And so, what you need to do is to engage in a much different way with these folks. They do not understand anything but toughness and strength, and we need to engage the Chinese to deal with the North Koreans, but we also need to make sure that they understand there's a commander-in-chief who will not pay ransom for any hostage.This president and his former secretary of State are for paying ransom for hostages. When do that, you endanger even more Americans around the world to be the subject of this type of hostage taking and illegal detention. You need a strong commander-in-chief who will look these folks in the eye and say, we will not put up with this and we will take whatever actions we need to take, not only to get our people home safely, but to swiftly and surely punish those who believe they can violate the law and violate American's sovereign rights to travel the world freely and safely.This is unacceptable. And this is why this president is so weak and why the secretary of State, who is embracing a third Barack Obama term, would be even weaker.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Of course I would. As a former United States attorney who spent seven years of my life fighting this on the streets of my state, I would do that. But we need to do more. And let me tell you what we've done in New Jersey, Josh. We are working with the folks in New Hampshire in their legislature right now to show them how we're helping to solve this problem in New Jersey.Not just for this campaign &mdash; three years ago, I proposed a law that we signed into effect, which said that anyone who was a non- violent, non-dealing, first-time drug offender no longer goes to prison in New Jersey. They go to mandatory, in-patient drug treatment.What has happened is, crime has gone down 20 percent in those years. The prison population has gone down 10 percent. We've now closed the state prison &mdash; closed a state prison, and we're turning it into a drug rehabilitation facility, so people can get the tools they need.Listen, everyone out there knows this in New Hampshire. This is a disease. It's not a moral failing, it's a disease. And we need to get people the treatment they need. And let me tell you why. Because I'm pro-life.And I'm pro life not just for the nine months in the womb, I'm pro-life for when they get out and it's a lot more complicated. [applause]Sixteen-year-old, heroin-addicted drug girl on the floor of the county lockup, I'm pro-life for her life. The 42-year-old lawyer who is taking Oxycontin and can't get out of bed and support his family &mdash; I'm pro-life for his life. Everyone of those lives is an individual gift from God.And the last thing is this. These efforts we've taken over the last three years, 2015 in New Jersey, for the first time in four years, drug overdose deaths have gone down, not up.I'll bring the same solutions to the country. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Oh, so &mdash; wait a second. Is that one of the skills you get as a United States senator ESP also? Because I don't think it is.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Sure. First, let's remember something. Every morning when a United States senator wakes up, they think about what kind of speech can I give or what kind of bill can I drop? Every morning, when I wake up, I think about what kind of problem do I need to solve for the people who actually elected me?It's a different experience, it's a much different experience. And the fact is, Marco, you shouldn't compare yourself to Joe Biden and you shouldn't say that that's what we're doing. Here is exactly what we're doing.You have not be involved in a consequential decision where you had to be held accountable. You just simply haven't. [applause]And the fact is &mdash; the fact when you talk about the Hezbollah Sanctions Act that you list as one of your accomplishments you just did, you weren't even there to vote for it. That's not leadership, that's truancy. [applause]And the fact is that what we need to do &mdash; what we need to have in this country is not to make the same mistake we made eight years ago. The fact is it does matter when you have to make decisions and be held accountable for them. It does matter when the challenges don't come on a list of a piece of paper of what to vote yes or no every day, but when the problems come in from the people that you serve.I like Marco Rubio, and he's a smart person and a good guy, but he simply does not have the experience to be president of the United States and make these decisions. We've watched it happen, everybody. For the last seven years, the people of New Hampshire are smart. Do not make the same mistake again.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Thank you. I've spent the last 13 years of my life focused on one thing: serving the people who have given me the opportunity to serve them. Not about politics, not about partisanship, but putting the people of my state and our country first.I'm proud to have rebuild my state after Hurricane Sandy, and I'm incredibly proud to be on this stage tonight with these men asking for your vote.New Hampshire, I spent 70 days here with you. You've gotten to know my heart. My heart is to help you solve the problems of your state [bell rings] and the problems of our nation. If you give me your vote on Tuesday I will do just that. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~There it is. There it is. The memorized 25-second speech. There it is, everybody.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, he deserves credit for his record on jobs. He's done a very good job as governor of Ohio. Never said that John hasn't. He's done a very good job. [applause]But &mdash; but unfortunately, John's been so busy doing over stuff, he's using old statistics. That's OK. New Jersey had its best year of job growth in the last 15 years under five different governors this year in New Jersey. New Jersey cut spending over $2.3 billion and we have 10,000 fewer employees than we had when I walked in the door. John has a bigger government now and more employees than he had when he walked in the door.But all that doesn't matter. What really matters is this, that executive experience really matters. You heard this on the stage tonight. We've heard it said on the stage that President Obama knows exactly what he's doing.I'd like to ask all the veterans listening out there tonight, who are waiting in line for healthcare, who are literally dying because the Veterans Administration doesn't work, do you think Barack Obama knows what he's doing? I don't. And I'll tell you something. Anybody who evaluates him is knowing what he's doing and managing the government doesn't know how to manage a government themselves.And one last thing, David, which I think is really important. I listened to Senator Rubio's answer on his bill. He said his bill couldn't pass on the gang of eight. He acted as if he was somehow disembodied from the bill. It was his bill. He said this idea doesn't work. It was his idea.See, when you're a governor, you have to take responsibility for these things. You can't just act as if it happened out of nowhere. We have to take responsibility as executives. I take responsibility for my record in New Jersey. We've rebuilt the economy and rebuilt after the second-worst natural disaster in American history. I'm proud of my record. And by the way, I like Kasich's record, too. He's a good governor. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, I've been pretty helpful to the pro-life cause in one of the most pro-choice states in the union. I've stood up for the first time and now for the last six years we've de-funded Planned Parenthood, not talked about it like they do in Washington D.C.But for six years as governor, Planned Parenthood does not receive that funding from the state budget anymore; over $50 million worth of money that's been saved now, that is not going to do exactly what Hillary Clinton wants to have done and has advocated for.She believes that organization, which engages in the systematic murder of children in the womb, in order to maximize the value of their body parts for sale on the open market, is an acceptable position.Let me tell you something, I don't care if you are a millennial or whether you are in your 90s, no one is for that type of activity, unless you are the most radical type of extremist on this issue, like Senator Clinton and her party is on this issue.I'll say one other thing. The fact is, that I believe that if a woman has been raped, that is a birth and a pregnancy that she should be able to terminate. If she is the victim of incest &mdash; this is not a woman's choice. This is a woman being violated.And the fact is that we have always has believed, as has Ronald Reagan, that we have self-defense for women who have been raped and impregnated because of it, or the subject of incest and been impregnated for it.That woman should not have to deliver that child if they believe that violation is now an act of self-defense by terminating that pregnancy.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~What about Kasich? Can I introduce Kasich?
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Yeah, David, I would just like you to listen, again, everybody.This is the difference between being a governor who actually has to be responsible for problems and not answering a question. The question was, "Did he fight for his legislation?" [applause]It's abundantly clear that he didn't. It's abundantly clear that he didn't fight for the legislation.When the teachers unions attacked me with $20 million of ads because I wanted to reform teacher tenure, I fought them and fought them and fought them and I won.When they didn't want &mdash; when people wanted to raise taxes in my state at Democratic legislature and threatened to close down the government, I told them, fine. Close down the government. I'll get in my cars, head to the governor's mansion, order a pizza, open a beer and watch the Mets. You can call me when the government reopens.And guess what they didn't do? They didn't pass a tax increase, because I vetoed it and they never closed the government because they knew I would fight for what I believed in. The fact of the matter is, a leader must fight for what they believe in. Not handicap it and say, well maybe since I can't win this one, I'll run. That's not what leadership is. [bell rings] That's what Congress is. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~You bet I would. And the fact is that because I took strong action to make sure that anyone who was showing symptoms &mdash; remember what happened with that nurse. She was showing symptoms and coming back from a place that had the ebola virus active and she had been treating patients. This was not just some &mdash; like, we picked up her just for the heck of it, alright?We did it because she was showing symptoms, and the fact is that's the way we should make these decision. You make these decisions based upon the symptoms, the medicine, and the law. We quarantined her, she turned out to test negative ultimately after 48 hours, and we released her back to the State of Maine.But, I want to add something on the issue of mosques. Now, I'm the only one up here who's had a law enforcement background as a U.S. Attorney after September 11th. I went to mosques throughout my state to build bridges. To build bridges between our community in law enforcement so we can get intelligence and information from these folks.I've had the experience of working with them as Governor of New Jersey as well. We cannot mix the radical Islamic jihadist with everyday Muslim-Americans. New Jersey is the second largest Muslim- American population in America, of any state. These are good, law abiding, hard working people. What they need is our cooperation, and our understanding. They do not just need broadsides against them because of the religious faith they practice.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~You know what the shame is &mdash; you know what the shame is, Marco? The shame is that you would actually criticize somebody for showing up to work, plowing the streets, getting the trains running back on time when you've never been responsible for that in your entire life.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~A lot of time &mdash; let me talk. Quiet. A lot of times &mdash; a lot of times
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Am I allowed to respond? I have to respond.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~As to North Korea?
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Carolina.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~First of all, I respect what Ted just said, but if you noticed, he didn't answer your question. And that's what's going to happen &mdash; OK. [applause]That's what's going to happen with our enemies and the people we compete against. We're going to win with Trump. We're going to win. We don't win anymore. Our country doesn't win anymore. We're going to win with Trump. And people back down with Trump. And that's what I like and that's what the country is going to like. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Good evening.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Good.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~I actually think I have the best temperament. I built a massive corporation. I employ thousands and thousands of people. I've gotten along with people for years and years, have tremendous relationships with many people, including politicians on both sides. And no matter how you cut it, when I &mdash; when I came out, I hit immigration, I hit it very hard. Everybody said, "Oh, the temperament," because I talked about illegal immigration.Now, everybody's coming to me, they're all trying to say, well, he's right, we have to come to him. I hit other things. I talked about Muslims. We have a problem. Nobody else wanted to mention the problem, I brought it up. I took a lot of heat. We have to have a temporary something, because there's something going on that's not good. And remember this, I'm the only one up here, when the war of Iraq &mdash; in Iraq, I was the one that said, "Don't go, don't do it, you're going to destabilize the Middle East." So, I'm not one with a trigger. I'm not one with a trigger. Other people up here, believe me, would be a lot faster.But I'll build the mill arbitrary stronger, bigger, better than anybody up here, and nobody is going to mess with us. That, I can tell you. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~I didn't take the property.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~I don't think I am. I think I'm closer to common sense. We are going to repeal Obamacare. [applause]We're going to repeal Obamacare. We are going to replace Obamacare with something so much better. And there are so many examples of it. And I will tell you, part of the reason we have some people laughing, because you have insurance people that take care of everybody up here.I am self-funded. The only one they're not taking care of is me. We have our lines around each state. The insurance companies are getting rich on Obamacare. The insurance companies are getting rich on health care and health services and everything having to do with health. We are going to end that.We're going to take out the artificial boundaries, the artificial lines. We're going to get a plan where people compete, free enterprise. They compete. So much better. [applause]In addition to that, you have the health care savings plans, which are excellent. What I do say is, there will be a certain number of people that will be on the street dying and as a Republican, I don't want that to happen. We're going to take care of people that are dying on the street because there will be a group of people that are not going to be able to even think in terms of private or anything else and we're going to take care of those people.And I think everybody on this stage would have to agree [bell rings] you're not going to let people die, sitting in the middle of a street in any city in this country. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Is it public or private?
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~It's a private job.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Jeb wants to be &mdash; he wants to be a tough guy tonight. I didn't take the property.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~No &mdash; no, let me ask you, Jeb. [bell rings] Do you consider the Keystone pipeline private?
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~No, a good deal maker will make great deals, but we'll do it the way our founders thought it should be done. People get together, they make deals. Ronald Reagan did it with Tip O'Neil very successfully, you didn't hear so much about executive orders, if you heard about it at all. You have to be able to get a consensus.Now, the real person like it was mentioned about the deal with Iran, how bad a deal is that? It doesn't get any more amateurish than that. A good deal maker would never make a deal like that. With Congress, you have to get everybody in a room, and you have to get them to agree. But, you have to get them to agree what you want, and that's part of being a deal maker. You can't leave the White House, go to Hawaii and play golf for three weeks and be a real deal maker. It doesn't work that way. You have to get people in, grab them, hug them, kiss them, and get the deal done. But, it's got to be the deal that you want. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~No, it's a private job.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Real &mdash; a public use?
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Some?
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~That's because he got Ben Carson's votes, by the way, but we won't [inaudible]. Our country that we love so much doesn't win anymore. We don't win with the military, we don't' win on the border. You look at New Hampshire with the tremendous problem we have with heroin. Number one thing I hear from the people of New Hampshire, who I love, and developed such relationships, we don't win with healthcare. We don't win with trade.You look at what other countries are doing to us. China. Everyone, they're killing us on trade. If I'm elected president, we will win, and we will win, and we will win. Thank you, thank you very much. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~The woman ultimately didn't want to do that. I walked away.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~We have &mdash; tremendous &mdash; has been just sucked out of our country by China. China says they don't have that good of control over North Korea. They have tremendous control. I deal with the Chinese all of the time. I do tremendous &mdash; the largest bank in the world is in one of my buildings in Manhattan.I deal with them. They tell me. They have total, absolute control, practically, of North Korea. They are sucking trillions of dollars out of our country &mdash; they're rebuilding China with the money they take out of our country. I would get on with China, let China solve that problem. [bell rings]They can do it quickly and surgically. That's what we should do with North Korea.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, before I go there, I will tell you, I will bring jobs back from China. I will bring jobs back from Japan. I will bring jobs back from Mexico, where New Hampshire, by the way, has been virtually wiped out. They've lost so many businesses going to Mexico because of horrible trade deals. And now we're about to sign another trade deal, TPP, which is going to be a disaster for this country because they don't talk about monetary manipulation. It is going to be a disaster.I'm going to bring jobs back and I'll start bringing them back very fast. Under my tax plan &mdash; right now, we're the highest taxed country in the world. Under my plan, we cut not only taxes for the middle class, but we cut taxes for corporations. We will bring back trillions of dollars that's offshore. Right now, they have $2.5 trillion, and in my opinion, it's much more than that. That's what the government says. All of that money is going to come back.And we're not going to lose Pfizer, which is now leaving, and other great companies, which is now leaving. And they're all leaving. We have many, many companies that are leaving this country. We're not going to lose them anymore because we're going to have a tax structure that is going to keep them in our country.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, four years ago, I said, bomb the oil and take the oil. And if we did that, they wouldn't have the wealth they have right now. Now, I still say the same thing, because we're doing little pinpricks. We're not even bombing &mdash; if somebody's driving a truck, they give notice to the person driving the truck, "we're going to bomb." If they don't get out of the truck, the truck sails away with the oil.We actually have a case where we don't want to bomb the oil, because we don't want to hurt &mdash; pollute the atmosphere. Can you imagine General Douglas MacArthur or General Patton saying we can't bomb because we're gonna hurt the atmosphere?You have to knock the hell out of the oil. You have to take the oil. And you have also back channels of banking. You have people that you think are our great allies, our friends, in the Middle East, that are paying tremendous numbers of &mdash; tremendous amounts of money to ISIS.So we have to stop those circuits. Nobody knows banking better than I do. They have back circuits, back channels. Tremendous amounts of money is coming in through the banking system. So between the oil and the banking, you will dry them up. But it should have been done four years ago, not now.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, I'll tell you what. In the Middle East, we have people chopping the heads off Christians, we have people chopping the heads off many other people. We have things that we have never seen before &mdash; as a group, we have never seen before, what's happening right now.The medieval times &mdash; I mean, we studied medieval times &mdash; not since medieval times have people seen what's going on. I would bring back waterboarding and I'd bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, I &mdash; I know Diane Foley very well. Her husband and &mdash; these are tremendous people. I spoke for them, I raised a lot of money for the foundation. I fully understand, James, one of &mdash; that was really the first that we saw, really visually saw &mdash; it was so horrible.And I will tell you, though, with all of that being said, you can not negotiate this way with terrorists. If you do, you are going to have many, many more James Foleys.James Foley was a great young man. His parents are incredible people. They've done such a good job, since his &mdash; since his death. But you just cannot negotiate that way with terrorists, or you're gonna have so many other James Foleys.And one thing on the vets &mdash; during the last debate, I raised $6 million for the vets, and I will tell you something [applause] I will tell you that I think nobody here, nobody on this stage, gets along with the veterans groups in New Hampshire better than I do without ball (ph) to sarel (ph) and all of the people that I deal with and these are great people.The one thing that we're not mentioning, there's tremendous fraud, waste and abuse in the Veterans Administration and if I'm running things, that's going to disappear [bell rings] and it's going to disappear quickly. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, I think I am, and to me, I view the word conservative as a derivative I &mdash; of &mdash; of the word conserve. We want to converse our money. We want to conserve our wealth. We want to conserve. We want to be smart. We want to be smart where we go, where we spend, how we spend. We want to conserve our country. We want to save our country. And we have people that have no idea how to do that and they are not doing it, and it's a very important word and it's something I believe in very, very strongly.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, let me just &mdash; you know, he wants to be a tough guy. A lot of times, you'll have &mdash; you'll have &mdash; and it didn't work very well.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, let me just tell you about eminent domain because almost all of these people actually criticize it, but so many people have hit me with commercials and other things about eminent domain.Eminent domain is an absolute necessity for a country, for our country. Without it, you wouldn't have roads, you wouldn't have hospitals, you wouldn't have anything. You wouldn't have schools, you wouldn't have bridges. You need eminent domain. And a lot of the big conservatives that tell me how conservative they are &mdash; I think I'm more than they are &mdash; they tell me, oh &mdash; well, they all want the Keystone Pipeline. The Keystone Pipeline, without eminent domain, it wouldn't go 10 feet, OK? You need eminent domain. And eminent domain is a good thing, not a bad thing.And what a lot of people don't know because they were all saying, oh, you're going to take their property. When somebody &mdash; when eminent domain is used on somebody's property, that person gets a fortune. They get at least fair market value, and if they are smart, they'll get two or three times the value of their property. But without eminent domain, you don't have roads, highways, schools, bridges or anything.So eminent domain &mdash; it's not that I love it, but eminent domain is absolutely &mdash; it's a necessity for a country. And certainly it's a necessity for our country.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, let me say a couple of things. First of all, Marco said earlier on that President Obama knows exactly what he's doing, like we have this president that really knows. I disagree, respectfully, with Marco.I think we have a president who, as a president, is totally incompetent, and he doesn't know what he's doing. [applause]I think he has no idea what he's doing. And our country is going to hell. So, I just want to say, we disagree on that. Is that okay?
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, there is a divide, but I have to say that the police are absolutely mistreated and misunderstood, and if there is an incident, whether it's an incident done purposely &mdash; which is a horror, and you should really take very strong action &mdash; or if it is a mistake, it's on your news casts all night, all week, all month, and it never ends.The police in this country have done an unbelievable job of keeping law and order, and they're afraid for their jobs, they're afraid of the mistreatment they get, and I'm telling you that not only, me speaking, minorities all over the country, they respect the police of this country and we have to give them more respect.They can't act. They can't act. They're afraid for losing their pension, their job. They don't know what to do. And I deal with them all the time. We have to give great respect, far greater than we are right now, to our really fantastic police. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, they do. And, you know, they sue. Everybody sues, right? They see excessive &mdash; I mean, they go out, they sue. We have so much litigation &mdash; I see the courts, I see what they're doing. They sue, and you know what? We don't want excessive force. But at what point &mdash; you know, either you're going to have a police force that can do its job I was just up in Manchester, I met with the police officers yesterday. Tremendous people. They love the area, they love the people, they love all the people. They want to do their job. And you're going to have abuse and you're going to have problems, and you've got to solve the problems and you have to weed out the problems. But the police in this country are absolutely amazing people.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Yes.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Yes. OK, good. It looked like he was looking right at me, right there.I think that &mdash; I look at what's going on, I look at all of the polls, I do very, very well against Hillary Clinton. I can tell you, I'm the last person that she wants to run against.And I think you can see what we've done in terms of galvanizing. I've been all over the country. We're &mdash; last night, I was in South Carolina, we had 12,000 people. It set up in about four days. We have galvanized and we've created a movement. A lot of it has to do with &mdash; as an example, Josh's question on drugs.I'm the first person that said, "Build a wall." But I mean, a real wall, not a toy wall like they have right now. A real wall. And you'll solve lots of problems.But we will galvanize the people of this country, and we will beat Hillary Clinton. Because &mdash; assuming that she runs, by the way, how she gets away with the e-mail stuff is hard to believe. So, I don't know that she's going to be running. But on the assumption she runs  [applause]I mean, look. And speaking of that, if she runs, she's running for one reason. She's going to be able to run for one reason, and that's because the Democrats are protecting her. Because so many people have done so much less than her, and they were absolutely &mdash; their lives have been destroyed.But on the assumption they do protect her, I will win the election and we will win it by a lot. We will win it handily. We cannot have another four years of essentially Barack Obama. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~you &mdash; let me talk. Let me talk. Quiet. A lot of times [booing] that's all of his donors and special interests out there. [booing]So &mdash; it's what it is. That's what &mdash; and by the way, let me just tell you, we needed tickets. You can't get them. You know who has the tickets for the &mdash; I'm talking about, to the television audience? Donors, special interests, the people that are putting up the money. [booing]That's who it is. The RNC told us. We have all donors in the audience. And the reason they're not loving me [booing] the reason they're not &mdash; excuse me. The reason they're not loving me is, I don't want their money. I'm going to do the right thing for the American public. I don't want their money. I don't need their money. And I'm the only one up here that can say that.Eminent domain, the Keystone pipeline &mdash; do you consider that a private job? Do you &mdash; do you consider that
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~You have to go in &mdash; first of all, when you take away their money, when you take away their wealth, that'll very much weaken &mdash; and it will happen fairly fast.They'll last for about a year, based on all of the wealth they've accumulated. But when you stop the banking channels and when you stop the oil and take the oil &mdash; not just bomb it, take it &mdash; when you do that, it's going to dry up very quickly. They're going to become a very weakened power, quickly. Thank you.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~You wouldn't have massive &mdash; excuse me, Josh &mdash; you wouldn't have massive factories without eminent domain. [booing]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~You wouldn't have the Keystone pipeline that you want so badly without eminent domain.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~And the net result was &mdash; you tried.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~And you lost in the court.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Chris, why don't you mention my name so I can get into this.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Established by the courts &mdash; federal, state courts.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Good evening.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~How tough it is to take away a property from an elderly woman?
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~How tough it is to take away property from an elderly woman?
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~I appreciate that, I really do, thank you.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~I consider it a public use.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~I didn't mention him the second time.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~I do, and I do think that we should not impose any kind of political agenda on the military. There should be &mdash; if women can meet the requirements, the minimum requirements for combat service they ought to have the right to do it. For sure. It ought to be focused on the morale as well. We got to make sure that we have readiness much higher than we do today. We need to eliminate the sequester which is devastating our military.We can't be focusing on the political side of this, we need to realize that our military force is how we project our word in the world. When we're weak militarily it doesn't matter what we say. We can talk about red lines, and ISIS being the J.V. team, and reset buttons and all this. If we don't have a strong military than no one fears us, and they take actions that are against our national interest.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~I totally agree that we need to give veterans more choices. A veterans card to be able to go to a private provider will enhance the quality of the service inside the Department of Veterans Affairs. We need career civil service reform. Only three people were fired after waiting lists were dropped where veterans didn't get care and people died. It is outrageous. And Hillary Clinton says that that's acceptable? Because she is captive of the public service uniforms.Career civil service reform would allow the next president to fire people that are &mdash; that are showing sheer incompetence. At a town hall meeting today, someone came &mdash; told a story of their father who looked like he was 85. He had &mdash; he got a bill eight years later from an operation he had, eight years it took. They couldn't resolve the dispute and then he was told that he died. Literally, the Veterans Administration sent a death certificate to this guy and it took nine months to clarify the guy &mdash; I met him. He's voting for me. And he is &mdash; likely to be alive. [laughter] [applause]This is &mdash; this is outrageous. It is completely outrageous. So, giving veterans more choices, creating centers of excellence, focusing on the true problems that exist. Dr. Carson is completely right. We need to start focusing on this earlier, before they become veterans so that there's a customized plan so people don't fall through the cracks. We can do this, but it's going to require someone who has proven leadership skills to make it happen. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~I want to thank the people of New Hampshire, and I want to celebrate the birthday of a great president, Ronald Reagan would have been 105 today. [applause]President Reagan believed in the future of our country, believed in its greatness, had a hopeful, optimistic message. Drew people towards our cause. We need someone who has a proven record to take our case to the American people because our philosophy is by far the best one. Limited government, entrepreneurial capitalism, of peace through strength. I believe I have the skills to take our party to victory in November.I ask for your support on Tuesday to keep America, and make America a safer, stronger, and freer. Thank you all very much. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~I would like to see more millionaires. I think we need to grow more millionaires, we need create a prosperity society where people can rise up. [applause]This notion that somehow we're undertaxed as a nation is just fool hearty, when we have entitlements growing far faster than our ability to pay for it. A conservative, because that's the point of this, believes in limited government, believes in a entrepreneurial capitalism and a strong national defense.But it also has to be, we need to reform things. In my town hall meetings, I went to a place where a woman described her neighbor, who has a better economic deal by not working than her struggling to make ends meet. We need to be on the side of working people. And you know, the problem with the left is, another tax, another regulation, another mandate makes it harder for them to rise up.Everything that we should do should be focused on high, sustained economic growth, where the middle class gets a raise for the first time, and where people are rewarded for work, rather than non-work. And I know how to do this. And if people are interested in the specifics of this, they ought to go to jeb2016.com. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~I would. And I would do it in concert, again, with our Arab allies and with Europe, most particularly in this case. This is the lesson learned: in history, if you bomb something and not do anything as it relates to deal with the aftermath of this, if you don't have a stable government, you get what we have in Libya.And this is not &mdash; leading from behind is not an effective policy. We have to lead. Without the United States, nothing seems to work. Europe doesn't have the ability to &mdash; to &mdash; to lead &mdash; forward lead in this regard.And so dealing with the caliphate is important, because it now has spawned other areas. There have been 70-plus attacks in 17 countries, either inspired by ISIS or organized by ISIS, Libya being the most important one now.We have to deal with the caliphate, with building a Sunni army there, but we also have to deal with it in Libya. And I think the United States, ultimately, is going to play &mdash; play a significant role in this.The problem with the Obama administration is that they see this incrementally. They're reluctant. They don't lead. No one knows whether we're serious, and when we do it, we do it in increments you can barely see. [bell rings]The United States has to lead in a much more aggressive way than we're doing right now. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~If &mdash; but
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~It's a public use.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~It's a public use. It's a public use.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Look, I'm pro-life. In fact, on this stage, I'm the most pro-life person because I've acted on it for eight years as governor of the state of Florida. [applause]Where we abolished partial-birth abortion, where parents have the right to be notified when their teenage child is having an abortion. We were the first state to do a choose life license plate to raise money for adoption. We were the first state to have state monies go to crisis pregnancy centers, which recently was just increased to $4 million a year.We created greater regulation on abortion clinics, where there were horrific procedures. So I'm pro life, but I believe there should be exceptions: rape, incest and when the life of the mother is in danger. And so, that belief, and my consistency on this, makes me, I think, poised to be in the right place, the sweet spot for a Republican nominee. And others may have a different view and I respect it. [applause]  BUSH:  But I think we have to be cognizant of the fact there's a lot of people that are concerned about having a pro-life position without any exceptions. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Martha &mdash; Martha, if I
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Martha and David
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Martha and David, I just
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~No, no, I wouldn't. No, I wouldn't. And it was used sparingly, Congress has changed the laws and I &mdash; and I think where we stand is the appropriate place. But what we need to do is to make sure that we expand our intelligence capabilities.The idea that we're going to solve this fight with predator drones, killing people somehow is a &mdash; is more acceptable than capturing them, securing the information. This is why closing Guantanamo is a complete disaster. What we need to do is make sure that we are kept safe [applause] by having intelligence capabilities, both human and technological intelligence capabilities far superior than what we have today. That's how you get a more safe place is by making sure that we're fully engaged. And right now, this administration doesn't do that.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~No. I didn't say that. You &mdash; you asked a question not about the draft, you asked about registering. And if women are going to be
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Peyton Manning is supporting me. And I'm for Denver. [laughter]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Say it again?
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~That is not true. And the simple fact is to turn this into a limousine parking lot for his casinos is a not public use. [applause]And in Florida, based on what we did, we made that impossible. It is part of our Constitution. That's the better approach. That is the conservative approach.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~The difference &mdash; the difference between eminent domain for public purpose &mdash; as Donald said, roads and infrastructure, pipelines and all that &mdash; that's for public purpose. But what Donald Trump did was use eminent domain to try to take the property of an elderly woman on the strip in Atlantic City. That is not public purpose, that is down right wrong. [applause]And here's the problem with that. The problem was, it was to tear down &mdash; it was to tear down &mdash; it was to tear down the house
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~This is a &mdash; this is an important subject. I agree with everything that's been said here about repealing unconstitutional rules and rules that are creating real burdens for investing that creating jobs.But we also ought to get back to being a Tenth Amendment country, as well, a country that respects the states to be able to make more decisions. And in the Bush administration, we would shift transportation dollars back to the states. I trust Kasich and Christie to build the roads and the infrastructure of their states than Washington, D.C.EPA delegated authority, back to the states. Education dollars, back to the states. I would like to see reform take place all across the country, where there's more vouchers, more freedom. [applause]If we did that, we would shrink government's power in Washington, D.C. and we would have a much more effective government, where people would begin to trust our government again, because now, no one believes it works.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~this relates to strategic patience. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~This relates to the strategic patience of the Obama administration. They come up with these great marketing terms, and what they do is they pull back, and voids are filled, and they're now filled by asymmetric threats of terror, as well as nation-states on the run.The next president of the United States is gonna have to get the United States back in the game, and if a preemptive strike is necessary to keep us safe, then we should do it. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~we don't have a draft. I'm not suggesting we have a draft. What I'm suggesting is that we ought to have readiness being the first priority of our military, and secondly, that we make sure that the morale is high. And right now, neither one of those are acceptable because we've been gutting the military budget.We also need to reform our procurement process. We need to make sure there are more men and women in uniform than people &mdash; than civilians in our Defense Department. There's a lot of things that we need to reform to bring our defense capabilities into the 21st century and I'm the guy that could do that. That's why I have the support of generals, of admirals, of 12 Medal of Honor recipients and many other people that know that I would be a steady commander-in-chief and rebuild our military. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, first of all he said the exact same thing about me, that I would make a great Vice Presidential nominee when Mitt Romney was considering. I said the same thing about Marco. I think we were both right at the time, and Mitt picked somebody else. So, let's move on to the 2016 race. Who has the leadership skills  [applause] who has the leadership skills to lead? And, I'm proud of the fact that I have 12 Medal of Honor recipients, over 30 admirals and generals that believe that I would be a steady hand as Commander in Chief. That I serve as Governor of the state of Florida where we cut taxes and reduced government. I took on very powerful interests, forged consensus, fought for my beliefs, implemented them and the state was better off.We had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms in 16 months. The whole state was turned upside down. It required a steady hand. Leadership. You learn this, you learn it by doing it. It's not something that you just go up, and on the job do it. [applause]It's not the same. Look, let's be clear. Marco Rubio is a gifted, gifted politician, and he may have the skills to be a President of the United States, but we've tried it the old way with Barack Obama, with soaring eloquence and we got &mdash; we didn't get a leader we got someone who wants to divide the country up. The next President [bell rings] going to have to forge consensus to bring about a set of common purposes so that we can move forward again in this country
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, first of all, it's interesting that that happened literally days when this hostage release took place in Iran. A day or two days afterwards, North Korea took a &mdash; held an American student hostage. I think it's when we send a signal of weakness, when we are negotiating to release people that committed crimes in our country for people that didn't commit crimes that are held hostage in Iran.We saw the shameful treatment of our sailors, that this creates weakness &mdash; sends a signal of weakness around the world. The next president of the United States is going to have to get back in the game. Where the United States' word matters. Where we back up our allies, where we don't send signals of weakness. We need to use every &mdash; every influence possible to get this student back.And I think John is right about this, there are crippling sanctions that are available, as it relates to the two or three banks that North Korea uses to &mdash; to &mdash; use it &mdash; illicit trade. We ought to re-establish sanctions, not just because of the student, but because of their actions that they're taking right now, as it relates to building this missile capability.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, the Draft's not going to be reinstituted, but why &mdash; if women are accessing
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Why would they worry about it
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Yeah.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~You mentioned me. He mentioned me. One other thing that I think we ought to do, along with repealing Obamacare, we need to shift all of this power of healthcare, which is the most egregious form of federal power that is suppressing wages and incomes, and allow governors to have the Medicaid plans so that they can create 21st century Medicaid insurance for people that are stuck in poverty. There's so much that can be done, but I don't trust Washington to do it. I trust the state capitals to be the place &mdash; to be the source of innovation and reform in this country. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Carolina's going to win that one. I hate to say it. But they're going to win that one.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~David, David
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~David?
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Good evening.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~He says he didn't mention me the second time. I thought I heard it, Jeb. No. I'm just kidding. Thank you all very much for listening and being patient with all of us tonight. Thank you.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~I wanted &mdash; I wanted to say, look, this &mdash; there can be a win-win here. I have formed a collaborative between police and community leaders because people have to respect law enforcement. A family doesn't want dad or mom going home in a box. And for our community leaders, many of them think the system not only works &mdash; not only doesn't work for them, but it works against them.And I created a big collaborative in Ohio made up of law enforcement, community leaders, the head of my public safety and a former Democrat, liberal Senate senator Nina Turner, run it. They got together, they made recommendations on recruiting, on hiring, on the use of deadly force and what we're about to do is to bring community and police together so we can have a win-win.We need more win-wins in America and we don't have to pick one over another divide. We love the police, but we've got to be responsible to the people in the community. We have to do all of that. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Jeb mentioned me. Time for me to go again.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Josh, I mean, clearly, when a veteran comes home, they should get health care anywhere they want to go. In our state, which is what we should do in the country, you know, if they drive a truck from Kabul to Kandahar in Afghanistan, we say, you can drive a truck from Columbus to Cleveland, and you don't have to go get a license. We're going to hand you one.And if you've got expertise in the military, we're going to give you college credit or community college credit for the things that you did for our country. And in addition to that, I'll tell you, one of the biggest things I think has to be done &mdash; and I would do it as president &mdash; the Pentagon has got to work with the returning soldier, sailor, along with the family, and we &mdash; they're the most valuable employees in the country. I call them golden employees.Everybody wants to hire a veteran. But there is a disconnect between the job openings and the veteran when the veteran comes back. The veteran is a leader. The veteran is strong. The veteran is drug free. There should be no unemployment among veterans.And if the Pentagon will work with the veterans' services agencies all across this country, Josh, we can get people jobs and we can get them jobs quickly, get them their health care [bell rings] get them their college education. Let's lift them. They're the greatest people defending the United States of America and we need to take care of them, and we will. We will. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Josh?
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Let &mdash; but let me &mdash; let me just tell you. First of all, we have the lowest number of state employees in 30 years.Secondly, we have grown government at the rate of inflation. And I went from an $8 billion hole to a $2 billion surplus. And we've grown jobs by 400,000 &mdash; that's one of the fastest growing states in the country. Our pensions are secure and our credit is rock solid.Now, I've learned that, what makes things work, what gets the economy going, not just in Ohio, but in Washington &mdash; and it's three things. Common sense regulations, which we have, lower taxes, which we have, the lowest taxes, tax cuts in the country. And thirdly, a fiscal plan to balance the budget.When you go from $8 billion in the hole to $2 billion in the black, when you cut taxes by $5 billion and you grow over 400,000 jobs, that is a record that I can take to Washington, using the same formula that I used in Washington when I was part of the effort to balance the budget to give us a surplus and to create jobs.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Look, I'm &mdash; I'm not here &mdash; I like Chris.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Mary Katherine, let me just say this to you. [applause]You must have an agenda that you are ready to move on in the first 100 days. Jeb is right. If you delay and you wait, the Washington operators will take you down. I can tell you this, in the first 100 days, I will have legislation to freeze federal regulations, have them reviewed by the vice president, reduce state taxes on individuals, reduce taxes on corporations, have a fiscal plan to balance the budget, get the border protected and begin to fix Social Security in the first 100 days.So, anybody who is here tonight, if I get elected president, head out tomorrow and buy a seat belt, because there's going to be so much happening in the first 100 days, it's going to make your head spin. We're going to move America forward. I promise you. We're going to move us forward. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~That's what I did and I'll do it again in the first 100 days.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~to get the balance the federal budget balanced? You have to plead with people. To do what we've done in Ohio, you have to plead with people, then you go back down to Washington and do the same thing.You see, we have to remind people we're Americans before we're Republicans and Democrats, and when we wait, and when we delay what we end up doing, Mary Katharine, is we make the United States weaker. In fact, it's a foreign policy issue because people look at America not solving problems and they say what are they doing over there? So the point is you have to work with people. The problem with executive authority for the president, it's really bad news for this reason. Since he's given up on working with Congress, he thinks he can impose anything he wants. He's not a king. He's a president. An executive order should be used frankly in consolidation and with consulting with the leadership in the &mdash; in the Congress.I've done it in Ohio. I consult. I could use executive orders, but I don't trump the legislature, because if you do, you aggravate them, you anger them and then the long-term prospects get bleak. We have to solve problems in America by coming together, Republicans and Democrats, Americans first, party and ideology second &mdash; in the second back seat of this country. That's what we need to do. [applause]And we can do it. And we can do it.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, first of all, look. As the New York Times said, he's certainly not a moderate, but he can bring people together to solve problems. The fact of the matter is I've cut taxes more than anybody in the country this year. I have balanced budgets, the federal budget, the state of Ohio budget, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're up 400,000 jobs, and in Washington we were able to have significant job growth whenever we balanced the budget of which I was the architect.But, here's the beauty of it, it's not just balancing a budget, it's about jobs. You know, when I was kid growing up in a neighborhood where Dad went home at night and said, "I lost my job today", it just killed the family.It just was a devastating effect. We have to have economic growth, but once we have economic growth I believe we have to reach out to people who live in the shadows. I believe we need to help the mentally ill, the drug addicted, the working poor. We need to help the developmentally disabled to rise, and we need to help our friends in the minority community develop entrepreneurship. In other words, in American, conservatism should mean not only that some rise with conservative principles, but everybody has a chance to rise regardless of who they are so they can live their God given purpose. That's what conservatism should be. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, folks, I've done now over 100 town hall meetings and I've loved every second of it. It has been the greatest thing in the world. And I want you to know that you've changed me, because I've listened to your stories and I've had your hugs and I've seen your tears, and I've seen you walk away and say, I now have hope.You know, I've had a conservative message, but a positive message &mdash; not just a conservative message, but a positive message about how we can bring people together, how we can restore America's strength, lift everyone. New Hampshire, please give me a chance to carry this message forward to the United States of America. And then, I will come back. Thank you, loved it. And God bless you. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, right now the deals &mdash; there's no leadership. I mean, a lot of the things that we're talking about here tonight, on the border, and so many of the things. What we should be doing on foreign policy, you know what the problem is, Mary Katharine? There's not a leader that gets somebody to rise up.You have to have a leader that can inspire, and actually some of what Donald was saying is true. Look, do you know how hard it was
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, we've got to to step up the pressure. And by the way, I've gotta say, after being here, every one of my 100 town hall meetings in New Hampshire were a lot more fun than what I saw here today, were so much more positive.Look, in terms of North Korea, Martha, we have to make sure that we intercept both the ships and their aircraft, because what they're trying to do is to proliferate this very dangerous material, along with the &mdash; with the technology, the instruments that can be used for mass destruction.That's what I worry about the most, frankly, is non-state actors, people who don't have a uniform, people don't have a country, who can spread this, who are not subject to the &mdash; to the mutual assured defense. In other words, you strike us, we strike you.Some of these radicals, they don't care about that. That's what I worry about, for my children, and for their children, going forward. So, we have to be very tough.And we should tell the Chinese, look, if you're not going to do this ballistic missile defense to the Koreans, ballistic missile defense to Japan &mdash; and by the way, we should impose the same kind of sanctions on North Korea that we imposed on Iran, because they're able to shift money. They're able to send money and receive money. [bell rings]We've gotta to be very tough on this. And frankly, I think we could have &mdash; I think we could have let the Japanese know that if you want to take action on that &mdash; on that missile that's rising, you want to take action &mdash; you will have our support, if that's what you think is the best thing to do. We cannot continue to be weak in the face of the North Koreans, or, frankly, in the entire rest of the world.Martha, this is &mdash; this is the &mdash; relates
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, you know, David, I &mdash; I've just spent a lot of time here in this state, as I mentioned earlier, and we have to have practical solutions, just like we were just talking about a few minutes ago on North Korea. Look, the situation is, we need to finish the border. It has to be completed. Just like we lock our doors at night, the country has to be able to lock its doors. And we can have a guest worker program, where people can come in and out in an orderly way.And then for the 11.5 million that are here, if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, I believe they ought to pay some back taxes, pay a fine, never get on the path to citizenship, but get legalization. It is not &mdash; I couldn't even imagine how we would even begin to think about taking a mom or a dad out of a house when they have not committed a crime since they've been here, leaving their children in the house. I mean, that is not, in my opinion, the kind of values that we believe in.And secondly, I think at the end of the day, that Americans would support a plan like this. I think Congress would pass a plan to finish the border, guest worker, pay a fine, a path to legalization, and not citizenship. And we've got to get this done. And I will tell you this, within the first 100 days that I am president, I will put that proposal to the Congress. And I will tell you, as a former Congressman, and an executive, in Ohio, I can promise you that I believe you'll get the votes to pass that, and we can move on with that issue and protect our border. That's what I think.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Because they currently occupy Sunni cities and villages. Sunni cities and villages can only truly be liberated and held by Sunnis themselves. If they are held by Shias it will trigger sectarian violence. The Kurds are incredible fighters and they will liberate the Kurdish areas, but Kurds can not and do not want to liberate and hold Sunni villages and towns.It will take Sunni fighters themselves in that region to take those villages and cities, and then to hold them and avoid the sort of sectarian violence that follows in the past.And why that is important is because if Sunnis are not able to govern themselves in these areas, you are going to have a successor group to ISIS. ISIS is a successor group of Al Qaida. In fact, they broke away [bell rings] from Al Qaida, because as horrible as Al Qaida is, ISIS thought Al Qaida was not radical enough. This is who we're dealing with, and they have more money than Al Qaida ever had.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~But Martha, just &mdash; Martha, just to clarify on that point, because he's right, and one more thing to point &mdash; it is standard procedure of the United States to shoot down those missiles once launched if they pose a threat to civilians, land and ships.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Chris &mdash; Chris, your state got hit by a massive snowstorm two weeks ago. You didn't even want to go back. They had to shame you into going back. And then you stayed there for 36 hours and then he left and came back to campaign. Those are the facts.Here's the bottom line. This notion that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing is just not true. He knows exactly what he's doing.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Chris, everybody &mdash; you said you weren't going to go back. He told everyone he wasn't going to go back. They had to shame him into going back. And when he decided to go back, he criticized the young lady, saying, what am I supposed to do, go back with a mop and clean up the flooding?
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Chris, you didn't want to go back. You didn't want to go back. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~First, let me say there are already women today serving in roles that are like combat. That, in fact, whose lives are in very serious danger, and so I have no problem whatsoever with people of either gender serving in combat so long as the minimum requirements necessary to do the job are not compromised. But, I support that, and obviously now that that is the case I do believe that Selective Service should be opened up for both men and women in case a Draft is ever instituted.I think the more fundamental challenge we're now facing is what's happening to the U.S. military &mdash; I've said this many times, and I think it's important to start paying attention to this. Our Air Force is about to be the smallest it's been in 100 years. I'm sorry, in our history. Our Army is set to be smaller than it's been since the second World War, and our Navy is about to be the smallest than it's been in 100 years.I think we need to begin to refocus on rebuilding our military because every time we have cut our military in the history of this country we have had to come back later and rebuild it, and it costs more, and it's a lot more chaotic and dangerous. When I'm president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Good evening.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Here's the bottom line. We can't get that legislation passed. The American people will not support doing anything about people that are in this country illegally until the law is enforced first, and you prove it to them.This has been abundantly clear. Every effort over the last ten years to do those comprehensively has failed. And it has failed because the American people have zero trust that the federal government will enforce our laws.And that's why since then, I have said repeatedly, if you are serious about immigration reform, then the key that unlocks the door to being able to do that is not just to pass a law that says it is going to enforce the law, but to actually do it. To hire the 20,000 new border agents, to finish the fencing and walls, to put in place mandatory e-verify, to put in place an entry-exit tracking system to prevent visa overstays.And once that is in place and that's working, I believe the American people will support a very reasonable, but responsible approach to people that have been here a long time, who are not dangerous criminals, who pay taxes and pay fines for what they did.But until then, none of that is going to be possible.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Here's the broader point, as well, and then I think it touches on what Donald just mentioned. Barack Obama views America as this arrogant global power that needed to be cut down to size. OK?This is a president that views this country as a country that's been too powerful in the world and we create problems around the world.For example, it's one of the reasons why he had betrayed Israel, because he believes that if we create separation from Israel, it will help our relations in the Islamic world. The same is happening in the Asia-Pacific region with accommodations to North Korea. North Korean should be back on that list of terrorist nations, as an example.And Donald's absolutely right. China does have a lot of influence over North Korea and he should be leveraging our relationship with the Chinese to ensure that North Korea no longer has access to the resources that have allowed them &mdash; a country that has no economy to develop long range missiles already capable of reaching the west coast of the United States potentially.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~I do support protection for the life of the mother because I'm pro-life. I just believe deeply that all human life is worthy of protection of our laws. If I'm president and there's a bill that's passed that saves lives but it has exceptions, I'll sign it.But I do believe deeply that all human life is worthy of the protection of laws. I've already said, for me, the issue of life is not a political issue and I want to be frank. I would rather lose an election than be wrong on the issue of life. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~I don't know of any problem in America that's going to be fixed with a tax increase. We have an economy today, an economy today that is not creating jobs that pay enough.And one of the reasons why is because we have one of the most expensive business tax rates on the planet. Our combined business rate puts us among the highest in the industrialized world. And then on top of that, we are the only one that has a worldwide system of taxation, where an American company who makes money abroad has to pay taxes where they made the money and then taxes a second time when they bring it back.The combination of these two things has stranded over $2 trillion, the equivalent of the size of the Russian economy, $2 trillion of American corporate money stranded overseas, combined with all of these inversions of companies leaving us.The solution to the problems we have today are not a tax increase. It is to lower our taxes on both people and on companies, so we can make America globally competitive again. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~I think it's already happening. Look at the turnout in Iowa. A historic number of people came out and voted in those caucuses. There are saying the same thing is going to happen here in New Hampshire. Look at the rallies that every single person on this stage is having. Much higher numbers than you used to see in the past and here is why.Because people are starting to understand, very clearly, that this election is going to be a turning point. That 2016 is not just a choice between Republican or Democrat. It is a referendum on our identity as a nation and as a people.So here is what Hillary Clinton needs to understand. We're going to have our primary, we're going to have our debates &mdash; which by the way, are twice as many as the Democrats have been willing to have themselves. But we're going to bring this party together and we are going to defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is unqualified to be the president of the United States of America.She put classified information on her computer because she thinks she's above the law and anyone who lies to the families of people who have lost their loved ones in the service of our country like she did in Benghazi, can never be the commander-in-chief of the United States of America. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~I would. But that's not &mdash; the issue &mdash; my problem with what he did is he continues to put out this fiction that there's widespread systematic discrimination against Muslim Americans.First of all, let's recognize this. If you go to a national cemetery in this country, you will see stars of Davids and crosses, but you see crescent moons. There are brave men and women who happen to be Muslim Americans who are serving this country in uniform and who have died in the service of this country. And we recognize that and we honor that. But by the same token, we face a very significant threat of home grown violent extremism.We need to have strong, positive relationships in the Islamic communities in this country so they will identify and report this activity, especially mosques, for example, that are participating not just in hate speech, but inciting violence and taking acts against us.And I do believe it is important also to recognize, you want to talk about religious discrimination in America. Well, I don't think Barack Obama is being sued by any Islamic groups, but he is being sued by the Little Sisters of the Poor. We are facing in this country Christian groups and groups that hold traditional values who feel and in fact are being discriminated against by the laws of this country that try to force them to vie to violate their conscience. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~If I may respond to that. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~It's your record, it's not a talking point
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Leadership is ultimately about solving the problem. And the approach that was tried and has been tried now repeatedly over ten years to do this comprehensively, all at once in a massive piece of legislation has no chance of passage.It is not leadership to continue to try something that has no chance of happening. I want to make progress on this issue. It has been discussed now for 30 years and nothing ever happens.And I am telling you that the only way forward on this issue that has any chance of happening, meaning gaining the support of the American people, you cannot do this without the support of the American people, is an approach that begins by proving that once and for all, illegal immigration is under control.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~No. He talked about Barack Obama.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Now, see, I was mentioned by Governor
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~OK, good, then I'll get to it [inaudible]. Here's the
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Thank you. You know, this week I had the great pleasure of having my kids join me on the campaign trail. I hadn't' seen them in a while, and it was great to have them alongside me, but the most important part of it is that it once again reminded me of what's at stake.Here in New Hampshire in less than 72 hours, we are literally deciding what kind of country we will be like when they are my age. What kind of country they will be able to raise their families in. And, that's why I'm asking you for your vote. You vote for me, and we will unite this party, we will grow the conservative movement, we will defeat Hillary Clinton, and we will leave our children what our parents left us. The single greatest nation in the history of all mankind.Thank you. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well &mdash; no, I understand. And not &mdash; but &mdash; but I think it's important to note that it is &mdash; and Senator Cruz, I think, was alluding to this, as well &mdash; it is the standard procedure of the United States, if those missiles pose a threat to land, civilians, our allies or any of our assets, to shoot down that missile in mid-flight.I understand your question was about a preemptive strike, but my point is that there is in place now contingencies to avoid any sort of that strike from going errant and destroying any &mdash; any assets of the United States, or implicating or hurting any of our allies or any of our assets in the region.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, first of all, I don't believe that believing in traditional marriage the way I do makes you a bigot or a hater. It means that you believe that this institution that's been around for millenial is an important cornerstone of society. I respect people that believe differently. But I believe deeply, that marriage should be between one man and one woman. [applause]On the issue of life, to me, the issue of life is not a political issue. It's a human rights issue and it's a difficult issue, because it puts in conflict two competing rights. On the one hand is the right of a woman to choose what to do with her body which is a real right.And on the other hand is the right of an unborn human child to live. And they're in conflict. And as a policy maker, I must choose which one of these two sides takes precedence. And I have chosen to err on the side of life.Here's what I find outrageous. There has been five Democratic debates. The media has not asked them a single question on abortion and on abortion, the Democrats are extremists. Why doesn't the media ask Hillary Clinton why she believes that all abortion should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child.Why don't they ask Hillary Clinton why she believe that partial- birth abortion, which is a gruesome procedure that has been outlawed in this country, she thinks that's a fundamental right. They are the extremists [bell rings] when it comes to the issue of abortion and I can't wait to expose them in a general election. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, first, we need to understand who they are. ISIS is not just a jihadist group, they're an apocalyptic group. They want to trigger a showdown in a city named Tibet between the west and themselves which they believe will trigger the arrival of their messianic figure.And I'm not saying that's what's going to happen. The reason why it's important to understand that is because these are not groups that are just going to go away on their own. They are going to have to be defeated. And I believe they need to be defeated on the ground, by a ground force, made up primarily of Sunni Arabs.It will take Sunni Arabs to reject them ideologically and defeat them militarily. That will require a coalition of Iraqis and Syrians, that are also Sunnis, but it will also require the cooperation of Jordanians, Egyptians. We should ask more of the Saudis.That will need to be backed up with more U.S. special operation forces alongside them. And it will have to be backed up with increased air strikes. And we are going to have to strike them, not just in Iraq and in Syria, but in every other part of the world where they have now created hubs of operation. They have affiliates in over a dozen countries across this planet. They have a sophisticated network of radicalizing people here in the homeland and around the world. [bell rings]But it all begins by taking away their their safe operating spaces with a ground force that a U.S.-led coalition takes on. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, here's the response. I think anyone who believes that Barack Obama isn't doing what he's doing on purpose doesn't understand what we're dealing with here, OK? This is a president &mdash; this is a president who is trying to change this country. When he talked about change, he wasn't talking about dealing with our problems.Obamacare was not an accident. The undermining of the Second Amendment is not an accident. The gutting of our military is not an accident. The undermining of America on the global stage is not an accident. Barack Obama is, indeed, trying to redefine this country. We better understand what we're dealing with here, because that's what Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders want to double down on if they are elected.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, I think conservatism is about three things and Donald touched on one of them, but it's about three things. The first is conservatism is about limited government, especially at the federal level. The federal government is a limited government, limited by the Constitution, which delineates its powers. If it's not in the Constitution, it does not belong to the federal government. It belongs to states, local communities and the private sector.It's about free enterprise, which is an economic model that allows everyone to rise without pulling anyone down. The reason why free enterprise is the greatest economic model in the history of the world is because it's the only economic model where you can make poor people richer without making rich people poor.And it's about a strong national defense. It's about believing, unlike Barack Obama, that the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military and the strongest nation on this planet. That's conservatism. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, I think the experience is not just what you did, but how it worked out. Under Chris Christie's governorship of New Jersey, they've been downgraded nine times in their credit rating. This country already has a debt problem, we don't need to add to it by electing someone who has experience at running up and destroying the credit rating of his state.But I would add this. Let's dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing. He is trying to change this country. He wants America to become more like the rest of the world. We don't want to be like the rest of the world, we want to be the United States of America. And when I'm elected president, this will become once again, the single greatest nation in the history of the world, not the disaster Barack Obama has imposed upon us.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, I was going for Peyton Manning, but now I'm rooting for Carolina. [laughter]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, let me say, from protecting the people of Florida from imminent domain abuse, to bringing accountability to the V.A., to the Girls Count Act, to sanctioning groups, I'm proud of my service in the United States Senate and before that, in the Florida legislature.I will say, if politics becomes and the presidency becomes about electing people who have been Congress or in the Senate the longest, we should all rally around Joe Biden. He's been around 1,000 years. He's passed hundreds of bills and I don't think any of us believe Joe Biden should be president of the United States.And let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing. Barack Obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country, to make America more like the rest of the world.That's why he passed Obamacare and the stimulus and Dodd-Frank and the deal with Iran. It is a systematic effort to change America. When I'm president of the United States, we are going to re-embrace all the things that made America the greatest nation in the world and we are going to leave our children with what they deserve: the single greatest nation in the history of the world.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, my brother's a veteran. We're very proud of him in our family. He served as a green beret in the 7th Special Forces from 1968 through 1971. And as part of his training, he jumped out of an airplane and he lost his two front teeth.And for years, he's had to go to get these dental claims. And every times he goes to get one of these dental claims filled, the V.A. asks him, "well, how do we know you lost your teeth in the Army?" And he says, "well, it's the only time I ever jumped out of a plane." [laughter] But he's had to fight through this process, and I've watched it firsthand. That's why I'm proud that I worked in a bipartisan way. We passed the V.A. Accountability bill that, for the first time, allows us to fire &mdash; allows the V.A. secretary to fire someone who's not doing a good job, who's a senior executive.And the governor's right. They've only fired three people up to now. More people will be fired if I'm president. But the portability part of it is incredibly important.Veterans should be able to take their V.A. benefits to any hospital or any doctor they want to go to. When I am president of the United States, veterans will be able to take their benefits to any hospital or doctor that they choose. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, no, sorry. Let me respond to that question.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, that's the &mdash; that's the reason why this campaign is so important. Because I think this notion &mdash; I think this is an important point. We have to understand what we're going through here. We are not facing a president that doesn't know what he's doing. He knows what he is doing. That's why he's done the things he's done.That's why we have a president that passed Obamacare and the stimulus. All this damage that he's done to America is deliberate. This is a president that's trying to redefine this country. That's why this election is truly a referendum on our identity as a nation, as a people. Our future is at stake.This election is not about the past. It is about what kind of country this is going to be in the 21st century, and if we elect someone like Barack Obama, a Hillary Clinton, a Bernie Sanders or anyone like that, our children are going to be the first Americans to inherit a diminishes country. That will not happen if I'm elected.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, the legislation passed, but it has no support. In essence, it couldn't pass in the House, it will never pass in the United States until we secure the border, and it is not the way we're going to do when I'm president.When I'm president, we are going to enforce the law first, prove to people that illegal immigration is under control. And then we'll see what the American people are willing to support when it comes to people that are not criminals, who have been in the this country for a long time and who otherwise would like to stay.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, the problem with the Sunni forces in the region is they don't trust this administration. This administration cut a deal with their mortal enemies, the Shia, in Iran. It poisoned the well with these countries. It makes it very difficult to cooperate with them as a result.They also, by the way, understand what real U.S. air power looks like. They saw the Iraq war. They saw, up close, also Afghanistan. They know what air power looks like when the United States is committed to the cause. And they see the airstrikes that are being conducted now, and they say to themselves, that's not real commitment. We know what real commitment looks like.The &mdash; the Jordanian king was in Washington three weeks ago. He told everyone who would listen that they have begged for permission from the coalition to target caravans. And the coalition &mdash; meaning U.S. leadership on the ground [bell rings] would not allow them to proceed with those airstrikes.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, when people talk about interrogating terrorists, they're acting like this is some sort of law enforcement function. Law enforcement is about gathering evidence to take someone to trial, and convict them. Anti-terrorism is about finding out information to prevent a future attack so the same tactics do not apply.And, it is true, we should not be discussing in a wide spread way the exact tactics that we're going to use because that allows terrorist to know to practice how to evade us.But, here's the bigger problem with all this, we're not interrogating anybody right now. Guantanamo's being emptied by this president. We should be putting people into Guantanamo, not emptying it out, and we shouldn't be releasing these killers who are rejoining the battlefield against the United States. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Yeah.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Yeah. I have a &mdash; I got mentioned, can I respond?
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~You didn't want to go back, Chris.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Absolutely, yes.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Actually, with respect, I have gotten the intelligence briefings on the Mid-East. Those have been going on for many years. I haven't gotten the intelligence briefing tonight on what North Korea's doing because I'm here in new Hampshire. When you're responding to an immediate incident, you need to know the intelligence of what's occurring.But what I was saying &mdash; look, it is qualitatively different dealing with a country once they have nuclear weapons. It's why you prevent them from getting nuclear weapons in the first place &mdash; because your hands are somewhat tied once they have nukes.It's why this Iranian nuclear deal is so catastrophic, and it's why I've pledged, on the very first day in office, to rip to shreds this Iranian nuclear deal so we're not sitting here in five years, wondering what to do about an Iranian missile launch when they have nuclear weapons. The stakes are too high for that.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Ben is a good and honorable man and Ben and Candy have become friends. He has an amazing life story that has inspired millions, including me. When this transpired, I apologized to him then and I do so now. Ben, I'm sorry.Let me tell you the facts of what occurred for those who are interested in knowing. On Monday night, about 6:30 p.m., CNN reported that Ben was not going from Iowa to New Hampshire or South Carolina. Rather, he was, quote, "Taking a break from campaigning."They reported that on television, CNN's political anchors, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash and Wolf Blitzer, said it was highly unusual and highly significant. My political team saw CNN's report breaking news and they forwarded that news to our volunteers, it was being covered on live television.Now, at the time, I was at the caucuses, I was getting ready to speak at the caucuses just like Ben was, just like everyone else was. I knew nothing about this. A couple hours later, I found out about it. I was told that Ben was unhappy. I called him that evening because I respect him very, very highly. I didn't reach him that evening.[bell rings] I reached him the next day and apologized. He asked me then, he said, Ted, would you make this apologize in public? I said, yes, I will. And I did so. I regret that subsequently, CNN reported on that &mdash; they didn't correct that story until 9:15 that night. So from 6:30 p.m. to 9:15, that's what CNN was reporting.Subsequent to that initial report, Ben's campaign put out a statement saying that he was not suspending his campaign. I wish that our campaign staff had forwarded that statement. They were unaware of it, I wish that they had, that's why I apologized.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Good evening.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~I think that is an assessment the voters are going to make. And they are going to make it of each and everyone of us. They are going to assess who is level-headed, who has clear vision, who has judgment, who can confront our enemies, who can confront the threats we face in this country, and who can have the judgment when to engage and when not to engage &mdash; both are incredibly important for a commander-in-chief, knowing how to go after our enemies.In the case of Iran, for example, who has the clarity of vision to understand that the Ayatollah Khamenei, when he chants, "Death to America," he means it. We need a president with the judgment and resolve to keep this country safe from radical Islamic terrorists.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~I would not bring it back in any sort of widespread use. And indeed, I joined with Senator McCain in legislation that would prohibit line officers from employing it because I think bad things happen when enhanced interrogation is employed at lower levels.But when it comes to keeping this country safe, the commander in chief has inherent constitutional authority to keep this country safe. And so, if it were necessary to, say, prevent a city from facing an imminent terrorist attack, you can rest assured that as commander in chief, I would use whatever enhanced interrogation methods we could to keep this country safe.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Martha, I will tell you, I have visited with active duty military, with veterans over and over and over again in town halls all over the state of New Hampshire. What we are doing to our sons and daughters, it is immoral. We are sending them into fight with their arms tied behind their back. They cannot defend themselves. And it is wrong. [applause]And I will tell you this. Look. America has always been reluctant to use military force. It's the last step we take. But if and when we use it when it comes to defeating ISIS, we should use it. We should use overwhelming force, kill the enemy and then get the heck out. Don't engage in nation-building but instead, allow our soldiers to do their jobs instead of risking their lives with politicians making it impossible to accomplish the objective. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~So, in terms of a practical solution, I've laid out the most detailed plan for solving illegal immigration. It's 11 pages, single-spaced, chapter and verse. It's on our website, tedcruz.org.In short, we're going to do, we're going to build a wall. We're going to triple the border patrol. We're going to increase &mdash; and actually, since Donald enjoyed that, I will simply say, I've got somebody in mind to build it.We're going to increase four-fold, the fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, so that you have technology monitoring an attempted incursion to direct the boots on the ground where they're occurring. We're going to put in place a strong e-verify system in the workplace, so you can't get a job without proving you are here legally.We'll put in place a biometric exit-entry system on visas, because 40 percent of illegal immigration comes not over the border illegally, but people coming on visas and overstaying.We will end sanctuary cities by cutting off taxpayer dollars to any jurisdiction that defies federal immigration law. [applause] And we will end welfare benefits for those here illegally. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, I would note, initially the fact that we're seeing the launch, and we're seeing the launch from a nuclear North Korea is the direct result of the failures of the first Clinton administration. The Clinton administration led the world in relaxing sanctions against North Korea. Billions of dollars flowed into North Korea in exchange for promises not to build nuclear weapons. They took those billions and built nuclear weapons.And, I would note also the lead negotiator in that failed North Korea sanctions deal was a woman named Wendy Sherman who Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton promptly recruited to come back to be the lead negotiator with Iran. So, what we are seeing with North Korea is foreshadowing of where we will be with Iran.With respect to North Korea and what we should do now, one of the first things we should do is expand our missile defense capacity. We ought to put missile defense interceptors in South Korea. South Korea wants them. One of the real risks of this launch, North Korea wants to launch a satellite, and one of the greatest risks of the satellite is they would place a nuclear device in the satellite. As it would orbit around the Earth, and as it got over the United States they would detonate that nuclear weapon and set of what's called an EMP, and electromagnetic pulse which could take down the entire electrical grid on the Eastern seaboard, potentially killing millions.We need to harden the grid to defend ourselves, and we need missile defense to protect ourselves against North Korea.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, Josh, as you noted, this is a problem that, for me, I understand first-hand. My older sister, Myriam, who was my half- sister, struggled her whole life with drug and alcohol addiction. My father and her mom divorced when she was a little girl and she was angry her whole life, and she ended up marrying a man who had been in and out of jail. She then became a single mom and she herself went to jail several times and she ended up spending some time in a crack house.I still remember my father and me driving up to get Myriam out of that crack house to try to convince her she needed to be a mom to &mdash; to my nephew Joey.She wasn't willing to listen. She was not willing to change the path she was on. She was angry. I was &mdash; had just gotten my first job coming out of law school. I took a $20,000 loan on a credit card to put my nephew, Joey, in Valley Forge Military Academy &mdash; he was in sixth grade at the time, to pay his way through that.And about five, six years ago, Miriam died of an overdose. It was &mdash; the coroner ruled it accidental. We don't know. She went to one night, had taken too many pills, and Joey walked in and found her dead.This is an absolute epidemic. We need leadership to solve it. Solving it has to occur at the state and local level with programs like A.A., and counseling, and churches and charities. But it also has to be securing the borders, because you have got Mexican cartels that are smuggling vast amounts of heroin into this country.We know how to secure the borders. What is missing is the political will to do it.And as president, I will secure the border, we will end this deluge of drugs that is flowing over our southern border and that is killing Americans across this country.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, let me take two different parts of that. Let me start with socialized medicine. Socialized medicine is a disaster. It does not work. If you look at the countries that have imposed socialized medicine, that have put the government in charge of providing medicine, what inevitably happens is rationing.You have a scarcity of doctors. You have rationing. And that means the elderly are told, we're going to ration a hip replacement, we're going to ration a knee replacement. We're going to ration end- of-life care.We're right now heading into a medical system with about a 90,000-doctor shortage in America and socialized medicine; whether proposed by the Democrats or proposed by a Republican would hurt the people of this country.What should we do on health care? If I'm elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare. [applause]And once we do that, we will adopt common sense reforms, number one, we'll allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines that will drive down prices and expand the availability of low cost catastrophic insurance.We'll expand health savings accounts; and we will de-link health insurance from employment so that you don't lose your health insurance when you lose your job, and that way health insurance can be personal, portable and affordable and we keep government from getting in between us and our doctors. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, look, I recognize it is an agonizing experience when anyone is facing a loved &mdash; loved member who's been kidnapped. But at the same time, putting in place legal regimes that encourage the payment of ransom has the effect of putting a bounty on other Americans. There is a reason it has been longstanding U.S. policy that we don't negotiate with terrorists, we don't pay ransoms.If you look at what President Obama has done over and over again, whether it was the James Bergdahl deal, which was absolutely shameful, releasing five senior Taliban terrorists to bring Bergdahl back, or whether it was this recent deal with Iran, where, again, up to 21 terrorists or potential terrorists were &mdash; were released or not prosecuted in order to bring back four Americans, what that does &mdash; does is it effectively puts a bounty on American servicemen and women serving abroad, on American tourists traveling abroad.And the proper approach [bell rings] is a president and commander in chief that defends this country and that goes after &mdash; goes after the terrorists, rather than showing them weakness and encouraging them to target more Americans.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, sure. It starts with a commander-in-chief that sets the objective. And the objective has to be utterly and completely destroying ISIS. Obama hasn't started with that objective and everything else flows from there.Once you set that objective, we have the tools to carry that out. The first tool is overwhelming air power. It is one of the blessings of the United States of America, having the greatest military on the face of the earth, is we have the ability to use that air power.As you know, in the first Persian Gulf War, it was 1,100 air attacks a day. Obama is launching between 15 and 30. Now, when I say saturation carpet bombing, that is not indiscriminate.That is targeted at oil facilities. It's targeted at the oil tankers. It's targeted at command and control locations. It's targeted at infrastructure. It's targeted at communications. It's targeted at bombing all of the roads and bridges going in and out of Raqqa. It's using overwhelming air power.You know, couple of weeks ago, it was reported that a facility is open called Jihadist University. Now, the question I wonder, why is that building still standing? It should be rubble. And if you had a president [bell rings] [applause]  all though I will say this. I would be willing to wait until freshman orientation before launching those bombs.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, thank you for that question. You know, there are three avenues of presidential authority to change the direction of this country. The first is executive power, the second is foreign policy, and the third is legislation. Executive power, as we all know, has been the preferred vehicle of President Obama, abusing his authority, abusing his constitutional authority.Now, the silver lining of that is everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power, so I have pledged on day one I will rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action Barack Obama has done. That means on day one his efforts to restrict the Second Amendment go away with the strike of a pen. That means on day one his illegal executive amnesty goes away with the strike of a pen.The reason I can end Common Core at the federal level is because Obama is abusing executive power using Race to the Top funds in the Department of Education to force it on the states. That's one avenue.The second avenue of change is foreign policy, and foreign policy can change the fastest. It's worth remembering that Iran released our hostages the day Reagan [bell rings] was sworn in. And, the third is legislation, and that can only be done with the people behind you, which is why the two big legislative initiatives I'm campaigning on are repealing Obamacare, and adopting a simple flat tax to abolish the IRS. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, under the definition of torture, no, it's not. Under the law, torture is excruciating pain that is equivalent to losing organs and systems, so under the definition of torture, it is not. It is enhanced interrogation, it is vigorous interrogation, but it does not meet the generally recognized definition of torture.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~Well, you know, David, the assessment the voters are making here in New Hampshire and across the country is they are evaluating each and every one of us. They are looking to our experience. They are looking to our knowledge. They are looking to our temperament and judgment. They are looking to our clarity of vision and our strength of resolve.The world is getting much more dangerous. We've had seven years with Barack Obama in the oval office, a commander-in-chief that is unwilling even to acknowledge the enemy we're facing. This is a president who, in the wake of Paris, in the wake of San Bernardino, will not even use the words radical Islamic terrorism, much less focus on defeating the enemy.I am convinced every individual standing on this stage, would make a much better commander-in-chief than Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. [applause]And the primary voters are making the assessment for each of us, who is best prepared to keep this country safe, to rebuild the military, to rebuild our Navy, our Air Force, our Army, our Marines, and to ensure that we keep America safe.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~What you do is, you enforce the law. You know, under the Constitution, the president has an obligation to, quote, "Take care that the laws be faithfully executed." Federal immigration law provides, if someone is here illegally and is apprehended, they are to be deported.We saw just this past week the head of the border patrol union testify before Congress that President Obama had given the order to the border patrol to stand down, not to enforce the law. That is wrong. I will enforce the law, and for everyone who says, you can't possibly do that, I would note that in eight years, Bill Clinton deported 12 million people.In eight years, George W. Bush deported 10 million people. Enforcing the law &mdash; we can do it. What is missing is the political will. And when they were deporting the people, the border wasn't secure, so they'd come right back. Once you secure the border, enforcing the law will solve this problem and that will benefit American workers.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~With an eye to February 20th, Carolina.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~You know, at this point I'm not going to speculate on that without the intelligence briefing that any Commander in Chief would have, knowing what exactly is there. [applause]One of the real problems
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire~February 6, 2016~You know, every candidate running for president says they will stand up to Washington. The natural follow up question is when have you ever stood up to Washington.Last week we saw a powerful illustration of that. I campaigned in the state of Iowa four-square against the ethanol mandate, something everyone said was political suicide. My two leading competitors both attacked me for it. The governor of the state said vote for anyone but Cruz, and lobbyists spent millions of dollars in attack ads, but I stood and said we should have no mandates, a level playing field, and the people of Iowa put country and our children above the cronyism and corporate welfare [bell rings]  We can turn this country around if we get back to the Constitution. And, I will always stand with the American people against the bipartisan corruption of Washington. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~And, by the way, just so you understand, as far as Iran, I would have never made that deal. I think it's maybe the world deal I've ever seen. I think it's the worst deal I've ever seen negotiated. I will be so tough on them and ultimately that deal will be broken unless they behave better than they've ever behaved in their lives, which is probably unlikely. That deal will be broken.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Because nobody knows the system better than me. I know the H1B. I know the H2B. Nobody knows it better than me. I'm a businessman. These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We're allowed to do it. And frankly, because of the devaluations that other countries &mdash; the monetary devaluations that other countries are constantly doing and brilliantly doing against us, it's very, very hard for our companies in this country, in our country, to compete.So I will take advantage of it; they're the laws. But I'm the one that knows how to change it. Nobody else on this dais knows how to change it like I do, believe me.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Because they don't cover most of the subjects. We're the policemen of the world. We take care of the entire world. We're going to have a stronger military, much stronger. Our military is depleted. But we take care of Germany, we take care of Saudi Arabia, we take care of Japan, we take care of South Korea. We take &mdash; every time this maniac from North Korea does anything, we immediately send our ships. We get virtually nothing.We have 28,000 soldiers on the line, on the border between North and South Korea. We have so many places. Saudi Arabia was making a billion dollars a day, and we were getting virtually nothing to protect them. We are going to be in a different world. We're going to negotiate real deals now, and we're going to bring the wealth back to our country. We owe $19 trillion. We're going to bring wealth back to our country. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Education through Washington, D.C. I don't want that. I want local education. I want the parents, and I want all of the teachers, and I want everybody to get together around a school and to make education great.And it was very interesting, I was with Dr. Ben Carson today, who is endorsing me, by the way, tomorrow morning, and he is  [applause]We were talking. We spoke for over an hour on education. And he has such a great handle on it. He wants competitive schools. He wants a lot of different things that are terrific, including charter schools, by the way, that the unions are fighting like crazy. But charter schools work and they work very well.So there are a lot of things. But I'm going to have Ben very involved with education, something that's an expertise of his.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~First of all, there's nobody on this stage that's more pro Israel than I am. OK. There's nobody. [applause] I am pro-Israel. [booing]I was the grand marshall, not so long ago, of the Israeli Day Parade down 5th avenue. I've made massive contributions to Israel. I have a lot of &mdash; I have tremendous love for Israel. I happen to have a son-in-law and a daughter that are Jewish, OK? And two grandchildren that are Jewish. [applause]But I will tell you, I think if we're going to ever negotiate a peace settlement, which every Israeli wants, and I've spoken to the toughest and the sharpest, they all want peace, I think it would be much more helpful is &mdash; I'm a negotiator. If I go in, I'll say I'm pro-Israel and I've told that to everybody and anybody that would listen.But I would like to at least have the other side think I'm somewhat neutral as to them, so that we can maybe get a deal done. Maybe we can get a deal. I think it's probably the toughest negotiation of all time. But maybe we can get a deal done.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~I have not made that decision yet. I will make a decision on that, but I have not made that decision. My decision was that I would go through the entire primary season and I have turned down probably $275 million worth. I have many, many friends that come up all day long, $5 million, $10 million, I'm turning down money. I feel sort of foolish to be honest with you. I don't know if I get any credit for it but I'm self-funding my campaign.And other than &mdash; and by the way, other than very small donations where people are sending in $200, $15, $20, and we have some of that, but it's not a large amount. No, I'm self-funding my campaign, and the reason is that I've been in this business a long time and I was on the other side &mdash; until eight months ago I was on the or side. I made massive contributions, large contributions to politicians, both Democrats and Republicans. I was liked by everybody, which is an important thing.I will say this &mdash; people control special interests, lobbyists, donors, they make large contributions to politicians and they have total control over those politicians. I don't want anybody to control me but the people right out there. And I'm going to do the right thing. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~I hope not. I truly hope not. I will say this. We have 25, 30,000 people &mdash; you've seen it yourself. People come with tremendous passion and love for the country, and when they see protest &mdash; in some cases &mdash; you know, you're mentioning one case, which I haven't seen, I heard about it, which I don't like. But when they see what's going on in this country, they have anger that's unbelievable. They have anger.They love this country. They don't like seeing bad trade deals, they don't like seeing higher taxes, they don't like seeing a loss of their jobs where our jobs have just been devastated. And I know &mdash; I mean, I see it. There is some anger. There's also great love for the country. It's a beautiful thing in many respects. But I certainly do not condone that at all, Jake.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~I mean a lot of them. I mean a lot of them.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~I think that what should happen, getting back maybe a little bit to your first question, I think that whoever &mdash; first of all, I think I'm going to have the delegates. OK? I think. Let's see what happens. [applause]But if somebody doesn't have the delegates, and I guess there's two of us up here that can and there are two of us that cannot at this moment. But if &mdash; no, that's just &mdash; by the way, that is not meant to be a criticism. That's just a mathematical fact. OK?If two of us get up there, I would say this, if &mdash; if Marco, if the governor, if Ted had more votes than me in the form of delegates, I think whoever gets to the top position as opposed to solving that artificial number that was by somebody, which is a very random number, I think that whoever gets the most delegates should win. That's what I think.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~I used to think Merkel was a great leader until she did what she did to Germany. Germany is a disaster right now. So I used to think that. [applause]And strong doesn't mean good. Putin is a strong leader, absolutely. I could name many strong leaders. I could name very many very weak leaders. But he is a strong leader. Now I don't say that in a good way or a bad way. I say it as a fact.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~I was against the giving of the money at all cost. I said don't negotiate at all until you get the prisoners back. If the prisoners don't come back early &mdash; three years ago. One of the longest negotiations I've ever seen, by the way. If they don't come back early, I was saying don't negotiate. They come back early.What you do is you take it back and you say, either give us the prisoners or we double up the sanctions. What we should have done is doubled up the sanctions and made a much better deal. Cause that deal is a disaster.Ted, the money is largely gone because of incompetent and very, very poor negotiators. But that money, the $150 billion, is largely gone and already spent everywhere but the United States.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~I will. First of all, I think and I know the H1B very well. And it's something that I frankly use and I shouldn't be allowed to use it. We shouldn't have it. Very, very bad for workers. And second of all, I think it's very important to say, well, I'm a businessman and I have to do what I have to do.When it's sitting there waiting for you, but it's very bad. It's very bad for business in terms of &mdash; and it's very bad for our workers and it's unfair for our workers. And we should end it. Very importantly, the Disney workers endorsed me, as you probably read.And I got a full endorsement because they are the ones that said, and they had a news conference, and they said, he's the only one that's going to be able to fix it. Because it is a mess. I think for a period of a year to two years we have to look back and we have to see, just to answer the second part of your question, where we are, where we stand, what's going on.We have to sort of take a strong, good, hard look and come up with plans that work. And we're rushing into things, and we're just &mdash; we're leading with the chin.[bell rings]We're leading with people that don't know what they are doing in terms of our leadership. I'd say a minimum of one year, maybe two years.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~I would listen to the generals, but I'm hearing numbers of 20,000 to 30,000. We have to knock them out fast. Look, we're not allowed to fight. We can't fight. We're not knocking out the oil because they don't want to create environmental pollution up in the air.I mean, these are things that nobody even believes. They think we're kidding. They didn't want to knock out the oil because of what it's going to do to the carbon footprint. We don't fight like we used to fight. We used to fight to win. Now we fight for no reason whatsoever. We don't even know what we're doing. [applause]So, the answer is we have to knock them out. We have to knock them out fast. And we have to get back home. And we have to rebuild our country which is falling apart.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~I would probably have the embassy closed until such time as a really good deal was made and struck by the United States. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~I would want to make a good deal, I would want to make a strong, solid, good deal because right now, everything is in Cuba's favor. Right now, everything, every single aspect of this deal is in Cuba's favor. It the same way as the Iran deal.We never walked &mdash; we never &mdash; all we do is keep giving. We give and give and give.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~If I become president of the United States, one of the things that will be an absolute priority is number one, protection of Israel, but also seeing if a deal can be made, the toughest deal, the toughest negotiation there probably is of any kind no matter where you look, no matter how hard you look.But I would like to give it a shot. Very, very pro-Israel, nobody more pro-Israel. But I would love to give it a shot. And I have to tell you this, Hugh. I have friend, Israelis, non-Israelis, people from New York City that happen to be Jewish and love Israel, and some are very tough people, every single one of them, they know it's tough, but every single one of them wants to see if we could ever have peace in Israel.And some believe it's possible. It may not be, in which case we'll find out. But it would be a priority if I become president to see what I could do.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~It depends on what comes up. You never know. It depends on what comes up. Look, look, we had a great president, Ronald Reagan. We had Tip O'Neill, speaker. And what do we do, we take these two men that are very, very different men, they got along, they had relationships, and they got things, and very beautifully.Nobody is complaining about the deals that Ronald Reagan made. And he made it with Tip O'Neill. We need to have people get together and work good deals out, good deals out from our standpoint. And I'll tell you this, it can be done.We don't want to continue to watch people signing executive orders because that was not what the Constitution and the brilliant designers of this incredible document had in mind. We need people that can make deals and can work, because right now in Washington there's total, absolute gridlock.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~It shows the total dishonesty of the press. We were having &mdash; on a few occasions, again massive crowds. And we're talking and I'm saying who is going to vote on Tuesday? Who is going to vote? The place goes crazy. Then I say, hey, do me a favor. Raise your right hand. Do you swear you're going to vote for Donald Trump?Everyone's laughing, we're all having a good time. That's why I have much bigger crowds than Ted, because we have a good time at mine. [applause]But we're all having a good time and the next day, on the Today Show and a couple of other place, not too many. Because when you look at it, everyone's smiling, laughing. Their arms are raised like this. They had pictures, still pictures of people and they tried to equate it to Nazi Germany.[bell rings]It is a disgrace. It was a total disgrace. And I've had reporters, people that you know, come up to me and said that &mdash; what they did on the Today Show was a disgrace. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Jake, I have to say &mdash; honestly, it's just the opposite. What will happen if they don't behave, we will put on a tax of some amount, and it could be a large amount, and we will start building those factories and those plants. Instead of in China, we'll build them here. And people will buy products from here, rather than buying it through China where we're being ripped off. And we have a $505 billion trade deficit right now.So we'll build our factories here and we'll make our own products. And that's the way it should be done. And the way we've been doing it for the last long period of time is our country &mdash; our country is in serious, serious trouble. It's a bubble and it's going to explode, believe me.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Let me go back to the other just for a second. In large mosques, all over the Middle East, you have people chanting "death to the USA." Now, that does not sound like a friendly act to me.As far as the families are concerned, and as far as the law is concerned, we have a law &mdash; this all started with your question on water boarding. We have a law that doesn't allow right now water boarding. They have no laws. They have no rules. They have no regulations. They chop off heads. They drown 40, 50, 60 people at a time in big steel cages, pull them up an hour later, everyone dead. And we're working on a different set of parameters.Now, we have to obey the laws. Have to obey the laws. But we have to expand those laws, because we have to be able to fight on at least somewhat of an equal footing or we will never ever knock out ISIS and all of the others that are so bad.We better expand our laws or we're being a bunch of suckers, and they are laughing at us. They are laughing at us, believe me. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Make me president. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Marco talks about consequences. Well, we've had a lot of consequences, including airplanes flying into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and could have been the White House. There have been a lot of problems.Now you can say what you want, and you can be politically correct if you want. I don't want to be so politically correct. I like to solve problems. We have a serious, serious problem of hate. [applause]There is tremendous hate. There is tremendous hate. Where large portions of a group of people, Islam, large portions want to use very, very harsh means. Let me go a step further. Women are treated horribly. You know that. You do know that. Women are treated horribly, and other things are happening that are very, very bad.[bell rings]Now I will say this, there is tremendous hatred. The question was asked, what do you think? I said, there is hatred. Now it would be very easy for me to say something differently. And everybody would say, oh, isn't that wonderful.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~One of the biggest political events anywhere in the world is happening right now with the Republican Party. Millions and millions of people are going out to the polls and they're voting. They're voting out of enthusiasm. They're voting out of love. Some of these people, frankly, have never voted before &mdash; 50 years old, 60 years old, 70 years old &mdash; never voted before.We're taking people from the Democrat Party. We're taking people as independents, and they're all coming out and the whole world is talking about it. It's very exciting. I think, frankly, the Republican establishment, or whatever you want to call it, should embrace what's happening.We're having millions of extra people join. We are going to beat the Democrats. We are going to beat Hillary or whoever it may be. And we're going to beat them soundly. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Ted was given to PACs. I mean, PACs &mdash; you know, these super PACs are a disaster, by the way, folks. Very corrupt. It's going to lead to lots of disasters. But Ted has super PACs and you have to look at the people that are giving to those super PACs, number one. It's very important to do that.There is total control of the candidates, I know it better than anybody that probably ever lived. And I will tell you this, I know the system far better than anybody else and I know the system is broken. And I'm the one, because I know it so well because I was on both sides of it, I was on the other side all my life and I've always made large contributions.And frankly, I know the system better than anybody else and I'm the only one up here that's going to be able to fix that system because that system is wrong.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Thank you very much.The Republican Party has a great chance to embrace millions of people that it's never known before. They're coming by the millions. We should seize that opportunity. These are great people. These are fantastic people. These are people that love our country. These are people that want to see America be great again.These are people that will win us the election and win it easily. These are people that once the election is won will be able to put Supreme Court justices up that will do a fabulous job. Because let me tell you, if we lose this election, you're going to have three, four or maybe even five justices and this country will never, ever recover. It will take centuries to recover.So I just say embrace these millions of people that now for the first time ever love the Republican Party. And unify. Be smart and unify. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~That doesn't mean I was endorsing that. I was not endorsing it. I said that is a strong, powerful government that put it down with strength. And then they kept down the riot. It was a horrible thing. It doesn't mean at all I was endorsing it.As far as Putin is concerned, I think Putin has been a very strong leader for Russia. I think he has been a lot stronger than our leader, that I can tell you. I mean, for Russia, that doesn't mean I'm endorsing Putin.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~The 45 percent tax is a threat. It was not a tax, it was a threat. It will be a tax if they don't behave. Take China as an example. I have many friends, great manufacturers, they want to go into China. They can't. China won't let them. We talk about free trade. It's not tree free trade, it's stupid trade.China dumps everything that they have over here. No tax, no nothing, no problems, no curfews, no anything. We can't get into China. I have the best people, manufacturers, they can't get in. When they get in, they have to pay a tremendous tax.The 45 percent is a threat that if they don't behave, if they don't follow the rules and regulations so that we can have it equal on both sides, we will tax you. It doesn't have to be 45, it could be less. But it has to be something because our country and our trade and our deals and most importantly our jobs are going to hell. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~We better solve the problem before it's too late.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~We have some protesters who are bad dudes, they have done bad things. They are swinging, they are really dangerous and they get in there and they start hitting people. And we had a couple big, strong, powerful guys doing damage to people, not only the loudness, the loudness I don't mind. But doing serious damage. And if they've got to be taken out, to be honest, I mean, we have to run something.And it's not me. It's usually the municipal government, the police because I don't have guards all over these stadiums. I mean, we fill up stadiums. It's usually the police &mdash; and, by the way, speaking of the police, we should pay our respects to the police because they are taking tremendous abuse in this country and they do a phenomenal job. [applause]So we should pay &mdash; we should truly give our police. They're incredible people, we should give them a great deal more respect than they receive. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~We really have no choice. We have to knock out ISIS. We have to knock the hell out of them. We have to get rid of it. And then come back and rebuild our country, which is falling apart. We have no choice.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, first of all, I don't really think that. I think that I hold views that are very similar to many of the people. We are more inclusive. And if you look at the polls and if you look at the millions of people that have been pouring into the polls, it's, again, the biggest story.You look at all of these people that are coming in, something is happening. I am different in one primary respect, and that's trade. I feel that we have had horrible negotiators, horrible trade deals. The jobs in this country are disappearing, and especially the good jobs.You look at the recent jobs reports, which are really done so that presidents and politicians look good, because all of these people looking for jobs, when they give up, they go home, they give up, and they are considered statistically employed. So that's that.But I will say, trade deals are absolutely killing our country. The devaluations of their currencies by China and Japan and many, many other countries, and we don't do it because we don't play the game. and the only way we're going to be able to do it is we're going to have to do taxes unless they behave.If you don't tax certain products coming into this country from certain countries that are taking advantage of the United States and laughing at our stupidity, we're going to continue to lose businesses and we're going to continue to lose jobs.And if you look at the average worker over the last 12 years, their salary and their pay have gone down, not up. It has gone down. And I think that's why there has been such an outpouring of love to what I'm saying.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, first of all, I want you to understand that the Democrats, and I've watched them very intensely, even though it's a very, very boring thing to watch, that the Democrats are doing nothing with Social Security. They're leaving it the way it is. In fact, they want to increase it. They want to actually give more.And that's what we're up against. And whether we like it or not, that is what we're up against.I will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is; to make this country rich again; to bring back our jobs; to get rid of deficits; to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse, which is rampant in this country, rampant, totally rampant.And it's my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is. Not increase the age and to leave it as is.You have 22 years, you have a long time to go. It's not long in terms of what we're talking about, but it's still a long time to go, and I want to leave Social Security as is, I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it. I want to bring back our jobs, I want to do things that will make us, that will bring back GDP I mean, as an example, GDP was zero essentially for the last two quarters. If that ever happened in China. you would have had a depression like nobody's ever seen before. They go down to 7 percent, 8 percent, and it's a &mdash; it's a national tragedy. We're at zero, we're not doing anything.We've lost our jobs. We've lost everything. We're losing everything. Our jobs are gone, our businesses are being taken out of the country. I want to make America great again and I want to leave Social Security as is. We're going to get rid of waste, fraud, abuse and bring back business. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, I don't know if he's saying that. Look, I'm just saying very simply we have a country that I've never seen anything like it. I've been going over budgets and looking at budgets. We don't bid things out. We don't bid out, as an example, the drug industry, pharmaceutical industry. They don't go out to bid. They just pay almost as if you walk into a drug store. That's what they're paying.And the reason is they have a fantastic lobby. They take care of all of the senators, the Congressmen. They have great power and they don't bid out. The military is never properly bid. When we go out to military bids, it's not properly bid. And the people that really sell us the product are oftentimes the product we don't want, only because that particular company has political juice, OK?I'm self-funding my campaign. Nobody is going to be taking care of me. I don't want anybody's money. I will tell you something. We're going to go out to bid in virtually every different facet of our government. We're going to save a fortune. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, I don't really agree with President Obama. I think I'm somewhere in the middle. What I want is I want a much better deal to be made because right now, Cuba is making &mdash; as usual with our country, we don't make good deal. We don't have our right people negotiating, we have people that don't have a clue.As an example, I heard recently where the threat was made that they want reparations for years of abuse by the United States, and nobody's talking about it and they'll end up signing a deal and then we'll get sued for $400 billion or $1 trillion.All that stuff has to be agreed to now. We don't want to get sued after the deal is made. So I don't agree with President Obama, I do agree something should be &mdash; should take place. After 50 years, it's enough time, folks. But we have to make a good deal and we have to get rid of all the litigation that's going to happen.This was just a little story but it was a big story to me because I said oh, here we go, we make a deal, then get sued for a tremendous amount of money for reparations. So I want to do something, but it's got to be done intelligently. We have to make good deal.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, if Ted was listening, he would have heard me say something very similar. I said we would not do the deal unless it was going to be a very good deal for us. And I think I said it loud and I think I said it very clear. And I think after 50 years, and I have many friends, I own many properties in Miami, many, many, and I have many people that know and they feel exactly the way I do, make a deal, it would be great, but it's got to be a great deal for the United States, not a bad deal for the United States. As far as Iran is concerned, I would have never made that deal. That is one of the worst deals ever, ever made by this country. It is a disaster. So for Ted to say I agree with this deal, I mean, it's a staple in my speeches that that may he worst single deal I've ever seen negotiated. So don't try to put it on me like it's wonderful, like I love it.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, that's fine. First of all, Ted was in favor of amnesty. So there's no question about that. And Sheriff Joe Arpaio recently endorsed me and there's nobody tougher on the borders than Sheriff Joe. And Jeff Sessions, one of the most respected Senator in Washington, an incredible man, also endorsed me.And there's nobody that knows more about the borders than Senator Jeff Sessions. I would say this. We're all in this together. We're going to come up with solutions. We're going to find the answers to things. And so far I cannot believe how civil it's been up here. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, you know, I've been watching the debate today. And they're talking about radical Islamic terrorism or radical Islam. But I will tell you this. There's something going on that maybe you don't know about, maybe a lot of other people don't know about, but there's tremendous hatred. And I will stick with exactly what I said to Anderson Cooper. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Yes. If you look back to Iowa, Ted did change his view and his stance on ethanol quite a bit. He did and &mdash; at the end. Not full on, but he did change his view in the hopes of maybe doing well. And you know, I think everybody knows that. It was a front page story all over the place, and he did make a change.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~You're right, Jake. But it has been taken over by the federal government. It was originally supposed to be that way. And certainly sounds better that way. But it has all been taken over now by the bureaucrats in Washington, and they are not interested in what's happening in Miami or in Florida, in many cases.Now in some cases they would be. But in many cases they are more interested in their paycheck and the big bureaucracy than they are taking care of the children. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~You know, I listen and I watch Ted on television and when he speaks, and he's always saying, "I'm the only one that beat Donald in six contests; and I beat him." But I beat him in 13 contests. He never mentions that. [applause] And let me just tell you another little fact, little minor fact. I have about a 1.6 million votes during this primary season, more votes than Ted. The other thing is, I beat Hillary, and I will give you the list, I beat Hillary in many of the polls that have been taken. And each week, I get better and better. And believe me, I haven't even started on her yet.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Hugh, I've said all along and laid out my foreign policy, I'm going to remind everybody that 55 percent of the foreign policy experts in this country said I was the best to be commander-in- chief. I spent 18 years on the Defense Committee, Armed Services, and then I was in the Pentagon with Donald Rumsfeld after 9/11, in and out for a couple of years.We absolutely have to win this with a coalition. Arabs have to be with us. The Europeans have to understand that this threat is closer to them than even is closer &mdash; is as close as it is to us. And in addition to that, you have to be in the air and you have to be on the ground.And you bring all the force you need. It has got to be "shock and awe" in the military-speak. Then once it gets done, and we will wipe them out, once it gets done, it settles down, we come home and let the regional powers redraw the map if that's what it takes.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~I don't &mdash; I haven't seen the provisions of that bill, Jake. My initial instincts are no. And let me just say about the V.A. When a veteran comes home, they ought to have access to healthcare wherever they want to go at any time, number one.Number two, the Veterans Administration needs to be restructured. It needs to be downsized and spread out. It needs to be so responsive to the needs of the veterans.And secondly, the Pentagon needs to share the information of returning veterans with the veterans' service operations in the states and with the job people in the states so that when a veteran comes home, they can be linked with a job.And when that happens, that means that every veteran will get work, because they're our golden employees. No veteran ought to be without healthcare; no veteran ought to be homeless; and no veteran ought to be unemployed in the United States of America.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~I think that the Chinese government butchered those kids. And when that guy stood in front &mdash; that young man stood in front of that tank, we ought to build a statue of him over here when he faced down the Chinese government. [applause]Now I will tell you, I don't believe that we need to make China an enemy. They are a competitor. But I want to go back to three things they should do. We should have the heat on them to work in North Korea to get rid of that guy and the things that he's doing, number one.Number two, they need to realize they don't own the South China Sea. And I will compliment the administration for sending a carrier battle group into the South China Sea. And thirdly, when it comes to the issue of cyber attacks, we're going to have to beef up the cyber command.And they need to understand that if you attack us we will defend ourselves, everything, including our grid. But if you do it, we have the capability to take out your systems. The president has not given the cyber command that authority. I will.And when it comes to trade, I will tell you this, they can't manipulate their currency. That will not be anything that I would allow them to get away with. And if I saw them doing it, I would take immediate action and make sure that the American worker is protected. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~No, I don't. I think there is a sect of, you know, this radical Islam that is really, really serious, and poses the greatest threat to us today. There isn't any question. And that's why the whole world has to work together to make sure that we don't have proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction.But look, I was there when, and saw it, when the Egyptian ambassador to the United States was in the Rose Garden bringing the Arab Muslim world to work with us to repel Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. The fact is that if we're going to defeat ISIS, we're going to have to have these countries. And they are Egypt. And they are Saudi Arabia. And they are Jordan. And they are the Gulf states.And we're going to have in some way or another a rapprochement with Turkey. And I frankly think the Europeans went in the wrong direction when they rejected Turkey from joining in to the economic sphere of Europe. The simple fact of the matter is, a lot of these Muslim countries, they are just &mdash; they can't believe the stuff they see out of people who have distorted their faith.Look, the people who represent radical Islam, they want to destroy everything that we're about and other Muslims who don't share their view. But at the end of the day, we've got to bring the world together, the civilized world. And we all speak with one voice to make sure that people who sit on the fence understand what civilization is, and we represent it, and equality and hope for everybody.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~No, I wouldn't. Listen, I think the problem with the administration, if you talk to our friends around the world, they say what is America doing? You know, you don't support us, we can't figure out where you are.You won't arm the freedom fighters in Ukraine, we let the Russians trump up some excuse in the business of Russian-speaking people. You had a red line in Syria. You walked away from it. You refused to fund the Syrian rebels, you undercut Egypt and we ended up with the Muslim brotherhood for awhile.And then we turn our back on Netanyahu when he comes to Congress to talk about his concerns of the Iranian deal. Look, I know in human nature sometimes there's a sense that you make better with your enemies than you do with your friends. And you know what happens when you do that? You make a terrible mistake.You need to support your friends, you need to hold your enemies out here [applause] and you need to negotiate tough deals. The fact is, they need to understand who we are. The Chinese understand. They don't own the South China Sea. They have to stop hacking everything we have in this country or we'll take out their systems. We will arm the Ukrainians so they have lethal defensive aid.We will destroy ISIS and Mr. Putin, you better understand, you're either with us or you're against us. We're not rattling a sword. You're not our enemy but we're not going to put up with this nonsense any longer.And a strong America is what the entire world is begging for. Where has America gone is what many of our allies say around the world.[bell rings]When I'm president, they're going to know exactly where we are because we're coming back.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well look, I believe in immigration, but it has to be controlled. The simple fact of the matter is I wouldn't be standing here. I'd be maybe running for president of Croatia if we didn't have immigration.Immigration is something that brings youth and vibrance and energy to our country. But we clearly have to control our borders. We can't have people just walking in. Look, we lock our doors at night in our homes. The country has to be able to lock its doors as well. So, we &mdash; I have a comprehensive plan to deal with this problem of immigration.I would say we have to absolutely finish the wall and guard the border. And if anybody were to come in after that, they are going to have to go back. No excuses because we can't continue this problem. I think we ought to have a guest worker program, where people come in, work and go home.And I think at the same time, for the 11 and a half million who are here, then in my view if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, they get a path to legalization. Not to citizenship. I believe that program can pass the Congress in the first 100 days.But let's not lose sight of the fact that the whole key to the future of America is strong economic growth with common sense regulation, lower taxes and a balanced budget.We can have a rising tide that lifts all the workers in America, all the people who are citizens of America, if we'll just follow the formula that works, that I used in Washington. And guess what, I've used it in Ohio to grow over 400 private sector jobs since I've been governor
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, first of all, let's not &mdash; you know, math doesn't tell the whole story in politics. The great thing about politics, the reason why we watch it is because what's true today is not necessarily true tomorrow. So let's not get ahead of ourselves. Secondly, look, when you went to school up there in Salem, Ohio, OK.If you got an 86, you got a B. Because everybody else had an 84 didn't mean you got an A. So you just have to win enough delegates to be the nominee.And frankly, I don't know if we're going to get a convention like that. But if we do, I was at one in 1976 as a wee lad and supported Ronald Reagan and actually worked directly with him. He tried valiantly. He lost. Gerald Ford won. The party was united. Gerald Ford served the country great by pardoning Richard Nixon. He lost the election probably because of that, but he put America first. And we were healed as a party.So, look, you have to earn the delegates in order to be picked. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. We don't know what's going to happen because we still have about half the delegates to be selected. And that's what's going to be a very interesting thing to see how it all turns out as we move forward over the next couple of weeks. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, first of all, we hear about taking on Washington. I took on Washington and I won. I actually got the budget balanced when I was a member of the Congress, the chairman of the budget committee. We paid down a half a trillion dollars of the national debt. We also balanced the budget four years in a row. And we were just growing jobs like crazy and the wage issue was not even an issue then.I also had a plan in 1999 to save Social Security and take the $5 trillion projected surplus and not only have Social Security for our young people, but also to give them private accounts. Now there are more 18-year-olds who believe they have a better chance of seeing a UFO than a Social Security check and we have a lot of seniors who are very nervous.I have a plan to fix it that doesn't even require raising the retirement age.If you've had wealth throughout your lifetime, when the time comes to be on Social Security, you'll still get it. It will just simply be less. And for those people who depend on that Social Security, they'll get their full benefit. That's the way it will work. And we don't have to monkey around with the retirement age. And how do I know that? I've done all this before.This is not a theory. Do you have to take on entitlement programs to balance a budget? Yes. It doesn't mean you have to cut them. It means you need to innovate them, the way we do things in the 21st Century.So not only did we have a balanced budget in Washington, but when I went to Ohio, we were $8 billion in the hole and now we're $2 billion in the black. Our credit is strong. We're up 400,000 jobs. And I want to go back with the same formula to beat the Washington insiders again.And I will get it done, and this country will be much stronger economically as a result. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, I'd like to say to all of you, the American people, I have run an unwavering, positive campaign for president of the United States. I have tried to be positive in such a way as to show my record, my accomplishments, my vision.And I wanted to raise the bar in presidential politics so our kids can take a look at the way you can run for president and you will someday maybe be president of the United States.Sometimes being positive isn't all that interesting, but it's very interesting to my family, my children and so many supporters that I meet all across the country and I will continue to run a positive campaign.I can fix the problems in Washington, I've done it before. And, in fact, I want to turn power, money and influence back to you, the American people, so that you can be in the schools and on the streets fighting drugs and dealing with the issues of poverty. We can do this together.Allow me to take care of the federal issues when I send the power back and the money and the influence to you and you can strengthen our nation and our neighborhoods and our families. That's where the spirit and strength of America is.But ask the people &mdash; my friends in Illinois and of course, my beloved Buckeyes to consider me on Tuesday and, please, let me have your vote. God bless. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, I &mdash; I do believe we contribute to climate change, but I don't think it has to be a, you know, either you're for some environmental stringent rules or, you know, you're not going to have any jobs. The fact is, you can have both.In our state, we've reduced emissions by 30 percent. But let me tell you also what we're trying to do. We want all the sources of energy. We want to dig coal, but we want to clean it when we burn it. We believe in natural gas. We believe in nuclear power.And you know what else I believe in? I happen to believe in solar energy, wind energy, efficiency, renewables matter.Now, it doesn't mean because you pursue a policy of being sensitive to the environment, because we don't know how much humans actually contribute. But it is important we develop renewables. Battery technology can unleash an entirely different world.So the fact is that you can have a strong environmental policy at the same time that you have strong economic growth and they are not inconsistent with one another.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, I worry about the violence at a rally period. I mean, it's &mdash; you know, elections are important but the unity of this country really matters.Jake, here's what I think is happening. There are people out there who are worried about their jobs. They're worried that somebody is going to come in and tell them they're out of work and they're 54 years old and they don't know where they're going to get another job, a man and a woman.Maybe they're worried about a trade deal. They're worried about the fact that their wages haven't gone up. They're worried that their kids went to college and the promise was, you go to college, you get a job, things are going to be great.They went to college, they rang up debt and they're still living in their parents' basement. People are uptight. Our seniors are worried they're going to lose their Social Security. There's two ways to treat it.You can either prey on that and be negative about it, or you tell people that these things can be fixed. If we're Americans rather than Republicans and Democrats, we get together, we can solve all of these problems.We can provide financial security, we can drive the wages up, we can get kids jobs with a more robust economy.[bell rings]And you know what? They want to help solve these problems right where they live and I'll give them the power to do it.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, Jake, I grew up in a blue collar family. And the simple fact of the matter is that of course we're sensitive about trade. One out of five Americans works in a job connected to trade; 38 million Americans are connected to it.But my position has always been we want to have free trade, but fair trade. And I've been arguing all along that it is absolutely critical that when other countries break those agreements, we don't turn the process over to some international bureaucrat who comes back a couple years later and says, "Oh, America was right," and people are out of work.The fact of the matter is we have to have an expedited process. When people cheat, when countries cheat and they take advantage of us, we need to blow the whistle. And as president of the United States, I absolutely will blow the whistle and begin to stand up for the American worker.But we don't want to lock the doors and pull down the blinds and leave the world. Because frankly, if we do that, prices will go up. People will buy less. Other people will be out of work. And we don't want to see that happen.Trade, though, has to be balanced and we have to make sure that when we see a violation, like some country dumping their products into this country, believe me as president, I will stand up and I will shut down those imports because they're a violation of the agreement we have and the American worker expects us to stand up.And Jake, my family worked in the steel industry, not with a white collar. I understand their plight. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, look, all I'm in favor of in Ohio is high standards. First of all, let me tell you, I would take 125 federal education programs, put them in four buckets, and send them back to the states. OK, I've been working on this for many, many years.Secondly, Jake, in our state, the state school board sets the standards. And we want high standards because we have not always had high standards, unfortunately. They set the standards and the local school boards develop the curriculum.Not only did we have that in the law, we reasserted it in the law. And we also want parental advisers in the local school district so that, in fact, you know, frankly, education has to be run at the school board level with a little guidance from the state.Now on top of that, you want to talk about the 21st Century and what we need to do with our kids? We need to start connecting them to the real world. We need to be training them for the jobs of the 21st Century, not the jobs of 20 years ago.We need vocational education starting in the seventh grade where kids can get that kind of education that can take them to college, but all the way through their K through 12 they ought to be connected with real-world jobs.Frankly, what ought to happen is we ought to get them to pursue their God-given talents and connect them with the things that give them passion. And that's exactly what we're doing in Ohio, combined with mentoring programs to talk to kids about what their future can be.So let me be clear, local control, obviously, high state standards. That's what it is in the state of Ohio. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, look, my record speaks for itself. What I talk about tonight is not a theory. These are things that I've done. I was there when we reformed the Pentagon on a bipartisan basis to give control to the commanders in the field and force the services to work together. I was the chief architect, along with Senator Domenici, of the last time we balanced the budget and the first time since we walked on the moon. I was there when I worked on the welfare reform in Washington. And we got it done and we eliminated the entitlement on welfare,I then went to Ohio and took Ohio from a basket case, working in a bipartisan basis to reform many things, including the Cleveland public schools, working with a Democratic mayor.My problem isn't that people don't know this. They say, well, what does that mean? Does that mean you're too easy? Well, let me tell you, when we did the balanced budget, we cut the capital gains tax, we provided a family tax credit, we shrunk the government.In my state, the state of Ohio, has the smallest government in the state of Ohio in 30 years. Conservative principles will work. But show respect to the other side.One final thing, in regard to Social Security, we will not get that done alone. We will have to have some responsible Democrats who will come in to fix the problem of Social Security. I know how to do it because I've done it and I'll do it again. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, thank you. You know, I look in the faces of people all across this country, and I know they want to be hopeful. And many are hopeful. Look, I can take conservative policies to the White House, to Washington, to restore the strength of our economy. But I also want to transfer power, money and influence to where you live, because I believe the strength in this country rests in the neighborhoods, the families, the communities and our states.And I believe it's a new partnership &mdash; a partnership that can allow us to restore the spirit of America and strengthen America for the best century we've ever had.Thank you. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, there's no question. They were saying that the Israelis intended to go to the Dome of the Rock. And I mean, when you think about this, thank goodness we work with Israelis to give them the Iron Dome where they can protect themselves against all the missiles that were flying in. Could you imagine living in like Miami here and having people shooting missiles in?Secondly, there was just an article the other day, Hugh, that I know you're familiar with the Israelis are learning to train underground in combat because the Palestinians now, Hamas in particular, is digging these tunnels trying to get under Israel. They're coming at them from above, they're trying to come at them under the ground.And I just have to tell you this, I don't believe there is any long-term permanent peace solution. And I think pursuing that is the wrong thing to do. I believe that every day that we can stability in that region by supporting the Israelis and making sure they have the weapons and the security that they need with our 100 percent backing is the way to proceed in the Middle East in regard to Israel. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~All right, first of all, the embassy is the former consulate. It's the same building. So it could just go back to being called a consulate. We don't have to close it that way. Second of all, I don't know where Cuba is going to use, but if they sue us in a court in Miami, they're going to lose. [laughter and applause]Third, on the issue of a good deal, I know what the good deal. I'll tell you what the good deal now, it's already codified. Here's a good deal &mdash; Cuba has free elections, Cuba stops putting people in jail for speaking out, Cuba has freedom of the press, Cuba kicks out the Russians from Lourdes and kicks out the Chinese listening station in Berupal Cuba stops helping North Korea evade U.N. sanctions, Cuba takes all of those fugitives of America justice, including that cop killer from New Jersey, and send her back to the United States and to jail where she belongs. And you know what? Then we can have a relationship with Cuba. That's a good deal. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~And embrace all of the principles that made us great.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~And To have a president forcing the Israelis to the table is harmful to the Israeli and emboldens Israel's enemies.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Correct.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Every election is important. I believe this is the most important election in a generation. Because what's at stake in this election is not simply what party is going to be in charge or which candidate wins. What's at stake is our identity as a nation and as a people.For over two centuries, America has been an exceptional nation. And now the time has come for this generation to do what it must do to keep it that way. If we make the right choice in this election, our children are going to be the freest and most prosperous Americans that have ever lived. And the 21st century is going to be a new American century. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~I do. A couple of points. The first is, I'm concerned about violence in general in this society. And by the way, the first people that are facing that violence are our law enforcement officers. And they deserve our respect and they deserve our thanks for everything they do for us.On the issue of anger. Yes, people are angry. Of course they're angry. Every institution in America has been failing us for the better part of 20 years or 30 years. But leadership is not about using the anger, leadership is about using the anger to motivate us, not to define us. But to motivate us to take action. Being here in Miami is special. My grandfather lived with us most of his life while I was growing up. And he would sit on the porch of our home and tell me all kinds of stories and things I learned about history.My grandfather was born in 1899 before there were airplanes in the sky. One night in the summer of 1969, he watched a man set foot on the moon.[bell rings]You know what he said when he saw that? He said Americans can do anything. Americans can do anything. There is no problem before us we cannot solve and we can solve it if we come together in a serious way, in this generation.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~I would say to him that there is no law that they want us to pass that would have any impact on that. If we pass &mdash; if you took the gift list of all of these groups that are asking us to pass these laws and did every single one of them, there would be no change in our environment. Sea level would still rise. All these other things that are happening would continue to go on for a lot of different reasons.One, because America is not a planet. It's a country. And number two, because these other countries like India and China are more than making up in carbon emissions for whatever we could possibly cut. Here's what he will immediately &mdash; and Mayor Regalado is a great mayor and a good friend &mdash; but here's what he's going to immediately going to start hearing from.He will immediately start hearing from families in South Florida who are barely making it by, and now their electric bill went up $20 or $30 a month because we just made it more expensive to generate power. That cost will be passed on to working families. I am not going to destroy the U.S. economy for a law that will do nothing for our environent. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~If it's being abused the way Disney did. Understand that program, it is illegal now under that program to use it to replace American workers. Under that program, you have to prove not only that you're not replacing Americans, but that you've tried to hire Americans. And if a company is caught abusing that process, they should never be allowed to use it again.The second problem with the current structure of the program that people perhaps don't understand is a lot of these companies are not directly hiring employees from abroad. They are hiring a consulting company like Tata, for example, out of India. That company then hoards up all of these visas. They hire workers. You hire &mdash; Disney or some other company hires this company.What they're basically doing is they are insourcing and outsourcing. They are bringing in workers from abroad that are not direct employees of a Disney or someone else, they're employees of this consulting business. And what I argue is that no consulting business such as that should be allowed to hoard up all of these visas, that the visas should only be available for companies to use to directly hire workers and that we should be stricter in how he enforce it.It is illegal now, it is a violation of the law now to use that program to replace Americans. And if a company is caught doing that, whether it be Disney or anyone else, they should be barred from using the program in the future.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~It's great to be here, back at home in Miami. It's hard to believe that just two decades ago, my father was just a bartender working in the city. And now his son stands on this stage, here, as a candidate for the highest office in the land. My parents never wanted me to go into politics or in particular or anything else. They just wanted me to have the opportunity to live out all the dreams they once had for themselves. And that was possible because America is a special country.But that was not an accident. America is great because each generation before us did what needed to be done. They solved their problems, they confronted their challenges. They embraced their opportunities. And for over two centuries, each generation has left the next better off.And now the moment has arrived for our generation to do our part. And I'm telling you tonight, if you vote for me, here in Florida and everywhere across this country on Tuesday, when I'm elected president, this generation will do it's part.We will do whatever it takes to ensure that our children inherit from us, what we inherited from our parents, the single greatest nation in the history of all of mankind. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Let me tell you what this election is about for me. And I get all the delegate math and all that debate. Let me tell you what's about for me. On Tuesday night, I didn't do as well, obviously, as I wanted to. And I was a little bit disappointed when I got home.And my wife told me a story that night, which is the reason why I can get up the next day and keep fighting. There's a gentleman here in South Florida who just got out of surgery. And his doctors told him he needs to be home resting. But every afternoon, he takes his little aluminum chair and he sits outside of an early polling center and holds a sign that says "Marco Rubio."Because for him, I symbolize all the sacrifices that his generation made so their children could have a better life than themselves [applause]That gentleman has not given up on me and I am not going to give up on him. I am going to work tirelessly every single day [applause] because this election is too important. What's at stake is the future of this country. And I believe &mdash; I believe that at the end of this process this nation will make the right choice because I've always believed that God has blessed America, that God's hand is upon this country and that its greatest days are yet to come. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~No, I support free trade deals that are good for America. We're 5 percent of the world's population. If all we do is sell things to each other, we can only sell to 5 percent of the people on earth. We have to have access to the hundreds of millions of people in the world today who can afford to buy things.The problem is we're a low-tariff country. To import something into the United States is not very expensive, but many of these countries we can't export to because their tariffs are too high. And so I am in favor of deals that allow us to bring down those tariffs so that America can sell things to all these people around the world.There are good trade deals and there are bad ones. So for example, here in Florida, we have benefited from the free trade deal with Colombia. It's allowed flower exporters to come into the United States but it's created jobs for hundreds of people who are now delivering those flowers and working in that industry. We have a surplus with Colombia.On the other hand, you've seen trade deals like in Mexico that have been less than promising in some aspects, better in others. Bottom line is I believe that America, if given access to foreign markets, our workers are the most productive in the world, our people are the most innovative on this planet. If it is a free and fair trade deal, we can compete against anyone in the world, and we need to in the 21st century. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~No, of course not. And we don't have to in order to defeat terrorists. The way you defeat terrorists is pretty straightforward. It's difficult to do, but it has to be done. When I'm president of the United States, the best intelligence agencies in the world that right now have been hamstrung. They're going to be expanded. And the best intelligence agencies in the world are going to find terrorists.And then the best military in the world, which needs to be rebuilt because &mdash; because Barack Obama is gutting our military. He's going to leave us with the smallest Army since the end of World War II, and the smallest Navy in a century, and the smallest Air Force we've ever had.We are going to rebuild that military and that military is going to find the terrorists and destroy them. And if we capture any of these terrorists alive, they're not going to have the right to remain silent. And they're not going to go to a courtroom in Manhattan. They're going to go to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and we will find out everything they know and we'll do so legally. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~No. And I &mdash; and I think you've outlined why. The numbers don't add up. You know, when I ran for the Senate in 2010, I came out and said we're going to have to make changes to Social Security, and everyone said that's the end of your campaign. In Florida, you can't talk about that, but people know that it's the truth here in Florida.Fraud is not enough. Certainly, let's wipe out the fraud, but as you said, it won't add up. You already gave those numbers. The second point is on foreign aid. I hear that all the time as well. I'm against any sort of wasting of money on foreign aid, but it's less than 1 percent of our federal budget. The numbers don't add up.The bottom line is we can't just continue to tip-toe around this and throw out things like I'm going to get at fraud and abuse. Let's get rid of fraud, let's get rid of abuse, let's be more careful about how we spend foreign aid. But you still have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit that you're going to have to make up.And here's the thing. If we do not do it, we will have a debt crisis. Not to mention a crisis in Social Security and Medicare. Both parties have taken far too long to deal with it. It is one of the major issues confronting America. It's barely been asked in any of these debates. And we'd better deal with or we're going to have to explain to our children why they inherited this disaster. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well first, I think &mdash; well, I'd be open to it if it takes a pause. But I don't think it takes a pause to enforce the law. What they are doing is they are in fact using that program to replace an American.If there's an American working at Disney and they bring someone from another country using H1B to replace their direct job, that's in violation of the law. And what I'm explaining to you is, what they are doing now is they are not &mdash; what they are doing is they are eliminating the job.They are outsourcing the entire tech division to a consulting company. They are making the argument that we didn't replace you. We just replaced the whole unit by hiring a company to do it instead. And that company that they're hiring is bringing their workers from abroad. It's a loophole they've figured out that we need to close so they can no longer continue to do it that way. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, first let me say that one out of four calls to our office is about a veteran here in Florida that's struggling with the V.A. my brother is a veteran. He's struggling with the V.A.The other day, we heard this horrible story. It was a headline in USA Today, and it said, "Calls to the V.A. Suicide Hotline Went to Voicemail." Well, about a few days ago, we now found out that one of the gentlemen &mdash; one of the veterans who left a voicemail committed suicide. And they happened to call him back the day after he died.People need to be held accountable for this. One of the things I'm proudest of is that in my time in the U.S. Senate working with Jeff Miller here from Florida in a bipartisan way, and I'll give him credit &mdash; Bernie Sanders was a part of this &mdash; we passed a V.A. accountability bill. And what it did is it created now a law that gives the V.A. secretary, because of the law I passed, it gives the V.A. secretary the power to fire people that aren't doing a good job.Senior executives should be held accountable if the V.A. outreach isn't working. The problem is no one's being held accountable. Even after we passed that law, no one's been fired for no outreach. No one's been fired for calls going to the voicemail. No one's been disciplined. No one's been demoted.When I'm president of the United States, if you work at the V.A. and you are not doing a good job, you will be fired from your job at the V.A. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, first of all, let me say that you're right, there are about 3 million seniors in Florida with Social Security and Medicare. One of them is my mother, who happens to be here today. I'm against any changes to Social Security that are bad for my mother. And we don't have to make any changes for them. But anyone who tells you that Social Security can stay the way it is is lying. Any politician that goes around saying, "We don't have to anything; all we have to do is raise a few taxes or just leave it the way it is," they're not being honest with you.Social Security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it. So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents.For example, instead of retiring at 67 the way I'm supposed to retire, I'd have to retire at 68. If I were still in the Senate, I'd be one of the youngest people there. [laughter]If I've made a lot of money, my Social Security benefit will not grow as fast as someone who made less money. And by the way, Medicare could very well become the option of using my Medicare benefit to buy a private plan that I like better. Medicare Advantage does that now.These are not unreasonable changes to ask of someone like myself who is 25 or 30 years away from retirement, in exchange for leaving the program undisturbed for the people that are on it now or about to retire, and ensuring that we do not bankrupt our country and that this program still exists when my children retire, when my grandchildren retire, when I retire. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, here we go. See, I'm not interested in being politically correct. I'm not interested in being politically correct. I'm interested in being correct. [applause]And in order to be correct on this issue, here's the bottom line. We do work. There is &mdash; Islam has a major problem on its hands. It has a significant percentage of its adherents, particular in the Sunni faith but also in the Shia, who have been radicalized. And are willing to fly planes into a building and kill innocent people.There is no doubt about that. It is also true if you look around the world at the challenges we face, we are going to have to work together with other &mdash; with Muslims, who do not &mdash; who are not radicals. We're going to have to work with the Jordanian kingdom.We're going to have to work with the Saudis. We're going to have to work with the Gulf kingdoms. We're going to have to work with the Egyptians to defeat, for example, ISIS.[bell rings]It will take a Sunni Arab movement to defeat them.And so I think you can be correct without meaning to be politically correct. We are going to have to work with people of the Muslim faith even as Islam itself faces a serious crisis within it of radicalization.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, I'm sorry I didn't answer that part. So the thing is that my &mdash; my generation, someone my age would retire at 68. We would continue to allow it to increase the retirement age for future generations until it hit 70. And so my children would retire at 70. I would retire at 68. It would be a graduating scale over a period of time.But again I'm talking about people like myself and Ted who are 45 years old. We're years away from retirement. For people that are on it now, we don't have to change it at all. If we don't do anything, we will have a debt crisis. It's not a question of if. It is a question of when. In less than five years, only 17 percent of our budget will remain discretionary; 83 percent of the federal budget in less than five years will all be spent on Medicare, Medicaid, the interest on the debt.That's &mdash; all of it will be eaten up by that. That's a debt crisis. And it will be debilitating to our economy and our children deserve better than to inherit a debt crisis. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, I think you can be flexible about ideas, you shouldn't be flexible about your principles. About when it comes to ideas and working with people, I have a record of having done that.Listen, on the issue of higher education, I'm the only one that continually talks about student loan debt because I owed over $100,000 of student loan debt. So I know this is a major issue. And all my ideas that deal with higher education are bipartisan.The VA Accountability Act that I passed I did it on a &mdash; on a bipartisan basis. The sanctions that I helped &mdash; that I imposed on Hezbollah I did it on a bipartisan basis. The Girls Count Act that deals with human trafficking, we did that on a bipartisan basis.But I also want to be frank. There are issues we're going to have to have an election over. When it comes to repealing and replaces Obamacare, that's not going to be bipartisan. When it comes to reducing the tax burdens on Americans, that's not going to be bipartisan. When it comes to shrinking the size of the federal bureaucracy,that's probably not going to be bipartisan.There are issues we can work together on and we should, but there are fundamental issues about the proper role of government. And on those issues, I will fight anyone who wants to expand government, raise taxes, or weaken our military. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, I would add when you talk about the millions of green cards that are coming in, those aren't actually workers at all. They are just coming in primarily based on family connection. And ;let me tell you, when my parents came in 1956, I acknowledge that my parents came to the U.S. on a family-based system.The problem is nothing looks like it did 60 years ago. The 21st Century economy simply is not creating enough jobs for people that don't have skills. When my parents came, they had a very limited education. My father stopped going to school when he was 9 years old because his mother died and he had to work. And he would work the next 70 years of his life and never go back to school. And I'm grateful every day that America welcomed them.But today in the 21st Century, 60 years later, finding jobs when you don't have skills is very difficult. We need to move to a merit- based system of immigration, not just on H-1B, particularly on green cards. The primary criteria for bringing someone from abroad in the 21st Century should be, what skills do you have? What business are you going to open? What investment are you going to make? What job are you going to be able to do when you arrive in the United States? [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, I would love the relationship between Cuba and the United States to change. But it will require Cuba to change, at least its government. Today, it has not. The fact of the matter is that after these changes were made &mdash; after these changes were made, there are now millions and hundreds of millions of dollars that will flow to the Castro regime.It will now allow them to become set permanent and in stone. They will now be able to carry out a transition where the military continues to run the country there. They'll put a puppet figure forward as their new president. And nothing will change for the Cuban people.There has not been a single democratic opening; not a single change on the island in human rights. In fact, things are worse than they were before this opening. The only thing that's changed as a result of this opening is that now the Cuban government has more sources of money from which to build out their repressive apparatus and maintain themselves there permanently.And we asked nothing in return. Compare that to the changes that were required in Burma. And by no means is Burma a perfect country. But at least when there was a democratic opening to Burma, they were required to make some democratic openings. When there was a diplomatic opening, it required democratic opening. And today, the former minority party is now the majority party in their legislative body.He asked nothing in return and we are getting nothing in return. And Cuba and its regime remains an anti-American communist dictatorship, helped North Korea evade U.N. sanctions. It's harboring fugitives of American justice, including people stealing our Medicare money and moving back to Cuba, all in exchange for nothing. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, let me say, I know that a lot of people find appeal in the things Donald says cause he says what people wish they could say. The problem is, presidents can't just say anything they want. It has consequences, here and around the world. [applause]And so let me give you one. Two days ago, I met this extraordinary couple who were on furlough because they are missionaries in Bangladesh. It's a very tough place to be a missionary. It's Muslim.And their safety and security very much relies upon friendly Muslims that live along side them, that may not convert, but protect them and certainly look out for them. And their mission field really are Muslims that are looking to convert to Christianity as well. And they tell me that today they have a very hostile environment in which to operate in because the news is coming out that in America, leading political figures are saying that America doesn't like Muslims. So this is a real impact. There's no doubt that radical Islam is a danger in the world.I can also tell you if you go to any national cemetery, especially Arlington, you're going to see crescent moons there. If you go anywhere in the world you're going see American men and women serving us in uniform that are Muslims. [applause]And they love America. And as far as I know, no one on this stage has served in uniform in the United States military. Anyone out there that has the uniform of the United States on and is willing to die for this country is someone that loves America. No matter what their religious background may be.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, sure if the climate is changing and one of the reasons is because the climate has always been changing. [applause]There's never been a time when the climate has not changed. I think the fundamental question for a policy maker is, is the climate changing because of something we are doing and if so, is there a law you can pass to fix it?So on the issue of flooding in Miami, it's caused by two things. Number one, south Florida is largely built on land that was once a swamp. And number two, because if there is higher sea levels or whatever it may be happening, we do need to deal with that through mitigation.And I have long supported mitigation efforts. But as far as a law that we can pass in Washington to change the weather, there's no such thing. [applause]On the contrary, there is laws they want us to pass. There are laws they want to us pass that would be devastating for our economy or these programs like what the president has put in with the Clean Power Act or all these sorts of things that he's forcing down our throats on the war on coal.Let me tell you who is going to pay the price of that? Americans are going to pay the price of that. The cost of doing that is going to be rammed down the throats of the American consumer, the single parent, the working families who are going to see increases in the cost of living.The businesses who are going to leave America because it's more expensive to do business here than anywhere else.And you know what passing those laws would have &mdash; what impact it would have on the environment? Zero, because China is still going to be polluting and India is still going to be polluting at historic levels. So, I am in favor of a clean environment. My children live in South Florida. My family is being raised here. I want this to be a safe and clean place, but these laws some people are asking us to pass will do nothing for the environment and they will hurt and devastate our economy.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, that's undeniable. First of all, they've said, they've encouraged people to do so. And you've seen the speeches of the Palestinian Authority president how glorious this is that they're doing these sorts of things.But let me go back for a moment. The policy Donald has outlined, I don't know if he realizes, is an anti-Israeli policy. Maybe that's not your intent but here's why it is an anti-Israeli policy. There is no peace deal possible with the Palestinians at this moment. There just isn't. [applause]Because there's no one to negotiate with. The Palestinian Authority is not interested in a serious deal and they are now in union with Hamas, an organization whose specific purpose is the destruction of the Jewish state. Every time that Israel has turned over territory of any kind, be is Gaza, or now in Judea and Sumaira, it is used as a launching pad to attack Israel. And that's what will happen again.These groups are not interested in a deal with Israel. What they are interested in is ultimately removing the Jewish state and occupying its entire territory.[bell rings]So maybe in 30 years the conditions will exist, but they do not exist now.

Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Actually that's incorrect. There are two different agreements. There's TPA and TPP. I opposed TPP and have always opposed TPP, which is what you asked about. And when it comes to trade, look, free trade, when we open up foreign markets, helps Americans. But we're getting killed in international trade right now. And we're getting killed because we have an administration that's doesn't look out for American workers and jobs are going overseas. We're driving jobs overseas.And the people who are losing out are in manufacturing jobs, or the steel industry or the auto industry. But I'll tell you who else is going to be losing out, which is the service industry. This Obama administration is negotiating the Trade in Services Agreement which is another treaty to allow services to come in and take jobs from Americans as well.And you've got to understand. Trade and immigration are interwoven, and they are hurting the working men and women of this country. So the question is, what's the solution? It's easy to talk about the problems. But do you have a solution to fix it? And I think the solution is several things.Number one, we need to negotiate trade deals protecting American workers first, not the corporate board room. Number two, we need to lift the regulations on American businesses here so we see jobs coming back. And number three, we need a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced that will not tax exports and that will tax imports, and that will bring millions of high-paying jobs back to America. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Common Core is a disaster. And if I am elected president, in the first days as president, I will direct the Department of Education that Common Core ends that day. [applause]Now, let me tell you why you can do that, because it's easy to talk about the problem, but you have to understand the solutions. The Obama administration has abused executive power in forcing common core on the states. It has used race-to-the-top funds to effectively blackmail and force the states to adopt common core.Now, the one silver lining of Obama abusing executive power is that everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power, and I intend to do that. [applause]Beyond that, though, Jake, I intend to work to abolish the federal Department of Education and send education back to the states and back to the local governments.And let me say finally, the most important reform we can do in education after getting the federal government out of it, is expand school choice; expand charter schools and home schools and private schools and vouchers, and scholarships. And give every child &mdash; African American, Hispanic &mdash; every child in need an opportunity to access to a quality education. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Donald, you are welcome to be president of the Smithsonian. [applause]You know, there are some in Washington who are having fevered dreams of a brokered convention. They are unhappy with how the people are voting and they want to parachute in their favored Washington candidate to be the nominee. I think that would be an absolute disaster and we need to respect the will of the voters. [applause]It's one of the reasons why in the course of this election &mdash; listen, everyone up here has worked very hard. But Donald is right, there are only two of us that have a path to winning the nomination, Donald and myself. At this point, I have roughly 360 delegates. He has about 100 more than I have. We have at this point beaten Donald in eight separate states all over the country geographically, from Maine to Alaska, from Kansas to Texas, all over this country we have beaten him.And so for the people at home, if you're one of the 65, 70 percent of Republicans who recognizes that if we nominate Donald Trump, Hillary wins. That's why the media wants him to be the nominee so much. If you recognize that, then I want to invite you if you've supported other candidates, come and join us.We are seeing candidates coming together and uniting. It's why Carly Fiorina endorsed me yesterday. It's why Mike Lee endorsed me today. I ask everyone to come together. Let's stand together and let's beat Hillary Clinton in November.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Fifty-nine years ago, Florida welcomed my father to America as he stepped off the ferry boat from Cuba onto Key West. He was 18. He was filled with hopes and dreams, and yet he was in the freest land on the face of the earth.This election, this debate is not about insults. It's not about attacks. It's not about any of the individuals on this stage. This election is about you and your children. It's about the freedom America has always had and making sure that that freedom is there for the next generation, that we stop Washington from standing in the way of the hard-working taxpayers of America. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~He's hunting them down and stomping them.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~I will let Donald speak for himself. But I will say, there's a reason, in my campaign I've laid out a very, very specific spend and cut plan, $500 billion. I've specified five major agencies that I would eliminate, 25 programs. And Dana, you know why political candidates don't do that? Because when you do that, the lobbyists attack you. When you specify the programs you would eliminate, then you get attacked. Let's talk for example back in Iowa the first primary. When I went to Iowa and campaigned against ethanol mandates, everyone said that was political suicide. You can't take on ethanol in Iowa. And my opponents on this stage not only didn't do the same. They attacked me and even promised to expand corporate welfare.[bell rings]If we're going to stop bankrupting our kids and grandkids, you've got to be willing to take on the lobbyists, which means not just some fanciful waste, fraud and abuse, but specifying these are the programs I'll eliminate so that we can take care of the hard working taxpayer. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Jake, let me be clear what Donald just said. He said that that 45 percent tax is a threat. And mind you, you are paying the tax. It's not China that pays the tax. It's you, the working men and women.So ask yourself at home: How is this helping you? If your wages have been stagnant for 20 years; if you can't pay the bills, how does it help you to have a president come and say, "I'm going to jack &mdash; I'm going to put a 45 percent tax on diapers when you buy diapers, on automobiles when you buy automobiles, on clothing when you buy clothing." That hurts you.It's why we've got to get beyond rhetoric of China bad, and actually get to how do you solve the problem. Because this solution would hurt jobs and hurt hard-working taxpayers in America.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Listen, I think for every one of us, we need to show respect to the people. We need to remember who it is we're working for. You know, we've seen for seven years a president who believes he's above the law, who behaves like an emperor, who it is all about him and he forgot that he's working for the American people.And let me &mdash; let me ask, turn the camera our here. How many of y'all feel disrespected by Washington? [applause]Washington isn't listening to the people. And that's the frustration that is boiling over. And we need to nominate and elects a president who remembers, he works for the people. You know, at Donald's rallies recently, he's taken to asking people in the crowd to raise their hand and pledge their support to him.Now, I got to say to me, I think that's exactly backwards. This is a job interview. We are here pledging our support to you, not the other way around. [applause]And the only hand raising I'm interested in doing is on January 20, 2017 raising my hand with my left hand on the [bell rings] bible and pledging to the American people to preserve, protect and defend the constitution of United States.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Listen, if you are fed up with Washington, the question you ought to be asking is who is willing to take on Washington? It's easy to have language, I'm fed up with the corruption in Washington. But if you have a candidate who has been funding liberal Democrats and funding the Washington establishment, it's very hard to imagine how suddenly this candidate is going to take on Washington.When I stood up and led the fight against Obamacare, Washington was furious and attacked me, but I did it because I was honoring my commitment to the hard-working men and women of this country who are losing their jobs because of Obamacare. [applause]When I led the fight against amnesty, it's because I was standing with the people [bell rings] against Washington. And if you want to tell people you're going to stand against Washington, the question we should ask is, when have you ever stood up to the lobbyists in Washington?
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~No, of course not. We've never targeted innocent civilians and we're not going to start now. But listen, Jake, I understand. People are scared and for seven years, we've faced terrorist attacks and President Obama lectures Americans on Islamophobia. That is maddening.But the answer is not simply to yell, "China bad, Muslims bad." You've got to understand the nature of the threats we're facing and how you deal with them. And yes, it is true there are millions of radical Islamic terrorists who seek to kill us. We need a president, commander in chief focused on fighting them.And I'll tell you, frankly one concern I have with Donald is that although his language is quite incendiary, when you look at his substantive policies on Iran, he has said he would not rip up this Iranian nuclear deal. I think that's a mistake.The Ayatollah Khomeini wants nuclear weapons to murder us. I'll give you another example, dealing with Islamic radical terrorism. On Israel, Donald has said he wants to be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians.As president, I will not be neutral. And let me say this week, a Texan, Taylor Force. He was an Eagle Scout, he was a West Point graduate, he was an Army veteran. He was murdered by a Palestinian terrorist this week in Israel, and I don't think we need a commander in chief [bell rings] who is neutral between the Palestinian terrorists and one of our strongest allies in the world, the nation of Israel. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Of course it does. And we've seen for seven years a president that has made the presidency and has made, sadly, his administration a laughing stock in the world. This administration started with President Obama sending back the bust of Winston Churchill to the United Kingdom within the opening weeks.Then he proceeded to go on a worldwide apology tour apologizing for the United States of America. Our friends and allies quickly learned America could not be counted on. I'll tell you, when I travel abroad, when I meet with heads of states and defense ministers and foreign ministers, they say over and over again, "it is hard to be friends with America; we can't count on America; America doesn't stand with us."And that is a disgrace. But the good news is, Jake, we've seen this before. We have seen a weak Democratic president undermine the military, weaken our readiness, weaken our respect in the world with Jimmy Carter. And in January 1981, Ronald Reagan came into office and that can change overnight.It's worth remembering Iran released our hostages the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office. [applause] And America needs a president who stands with our friends and allies, as I will do, and who stands up and demonstrates strengths to our enemies. That's why on day one, I will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal because the Ayatollah Khamenei must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Our focus needs to be on keeping this country safe.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~That's who you've got to be accountable to, the people.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~We need to do whatever is necessary to utterly defeat ISIS. And that's needs to be driven not by politicians but by military expertise and judgment. Right now we're not using a fraction of the tools that we have. We're not using our overwhelming air power. We're not arming the Kurds. Those need to be the first steps. And then we need to put whatever ground power is needed to carry it out.But, you know, a question that actually Jake asked, and I'm glad to come back to it now, is rules of engagement. We have right now our troops engaged in combat but President Obama has rules of engagement that are so strict that their arms are tied behind their back.They're not able to fight. They're not able to defend themselves. They're not able to kill the enemy. And I have got to tell you, Hugh, I think that is wrong. It is immoral. And I give my word to every soldier, sailor, and airman, and marine, and every wife and husband, every son and daughter, every mother and father, that will end in January 2017. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well look, absolutely. And one of the things we're so frustrated about is the corruption, what I've called the Washington cartel. It's career politicians in both parties that get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests.And listen, Donald told you for 40 years he's been sitting at that table using his money to buy influence, supporting liberal Democrats like Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, but also supporting the Republican establishment and funding their effort to crush the Tea Party. And now his argument is after four decades of being part of that influence buying, after Hillary Clinton spending decades being part of that influence selling, that suddenly he will change.But the interesting point is tonight he hasn't pointed to a single special interest he's willing to take on. He didn't take on Wall Street when he supported the TARP bailout in Wall Street. He won't take on ethanol. And my campaign, by contrast, was funded by 1.1 million contributions all over this country.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, Donald is right, for example, he was just talking about international trade. He's right about the problems. But his solutions don't work. So, for example, his solution on international trade, he proposed earlier a 45 percent tariff on foreign goods.Now he backed away from that immediately and he may come back with a different number tonight. I don't know where he'll be tonight. But I'll tell you what happens. You know, we've seen prior presidential candidates who proposed massive tariffs, you know, Smoot- Hawley led to the Great Depression.And the effect of a 45 percent tariff would be when you go to the store, when you go to Walmart, when you are shopping for your kids, the prices you pay go up 45 percent. But not only that, when you put those in place, because a tariff is a tax on you, the American people, but the response of that is that the countries we trade with put in their own tariffs.A much better solution that works is the tax plan I've laid out which would enable our exports to be tax-free, would tax our imports, would not raise prices for Americans, and would not result in reciprocal tariffs. Fix the problem and that's what's missing from what Donald says. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, look, there are some folks in Washington
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, look. I'll point out first of all it is a matter of public record that Donald supported John Kerry in 2004 over George W. Bush, and he supported Hillary Clinton, gave her two checks in a presidential campaign in 2008. And indeed, once she was secretary of State, he described her as one of the greatest secretaries of State in industry.And, you know, the point on the Iran deal, his answer to everything is if only if someone smarter were in government, things would be better. No. We don't just need smarter people in government. We need leaders that are protecting American interests. [applause]And when it comes to Iran, Donald has said he would leave the agreement in place and try to renegotiate it, giving the Ayatollah Khomeini over $100 billion. That reflects you do not understand the radical Islam terrorist that is the Ayatollah that wants to murder us.We need a commander in chief that understands our enemies [bell rings] understands and doesn't give them billions of dollars to threaten our safety and security. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, number one, we need to see responsibility. Social Security right now is careening towards insolvency, and it's irresponsible. And any politician that doesn't step forward and address it is not being a real leader. We need to see political courage to take this on and save and strengthen Social Security. [applause]And as president, what I will do for seniors, for anyone at or near retirement, there will be no changes whatsoever. Every benefit will be protected to the letter. But for younger workers, we need to change the rate of growth of benefits so it matches inflation instead of exceeding inflation. And as you noted Dinan, we need to have for younger workers, that a portion of your tax payments are in personal accounts, like the 401(k), that you own, that you control, that you can pass on to your kids and grandkids. [applause]And one of the things that is critically important. Listen, we've got lots of challenges in the world. But the answer can't just be wave a magic wand and say problem go away. You have to understand the problems. You have to have real solutions.It's like government spending. It is very easy. Hillary Clinton says she'll cut waste, fraud and abuse. If only we had smarter people in Washington, that would fix the problem. You know what? That is the statement of a liberal who doesn't understand government is the problem. [applause]Here's my philosophy. The less government, the more freedom. The fewer bureaucrats, the more prosperity. And there are bureaucrats in [bell rings] Washington right now who are killing jobs and I'll tell you, I know who they are. I will find them and I will fire them.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Well, we need to redefine our legal immigration system so that it meets the needs of the American economy. Right now, we're bringing in far too many low skilled workers. What that is doing is driving down the wages of hard-working Americans. Our system isn't working. And then on top of that, we've got a system that's allowing in millions of people to be here illegally.And the answer to that, I've laid out a very, very detailed immigration plan on my website. We're going to build a wall, triple the border patrol. We're going to end sanctuary cities. And let me tell you how we're going to do that.We're going to cut off federal taxpayer funds to any city that defies federal immigration laws. [applause]We're going to end welfare benefits for anyone who is here illegally. And the thing to understand, Stephen, we can solve these problems. It's not that we don't know how to do it. It's that we're lacking the political will. Neither of the parties in Washington wants to do this.The Democrats support illegal immigration because they view those illegal immigrants as potential voters and far too many of the Republicans are doing the bidding of Wall Street and the special interest and they view it as cheap labor.We need instead leadership that works for the working men and women of this country. We need an immigration system that takes care of the jobs of the working men and women of this country. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~What an incredible nation we have, that the son of a bartender and the son of mailman and the son of a dishwasher and a successful businessman, can all stand on this stage, competing and asking for your support.In just a few months, one of us is going to stand on the debate stage with Hillary Clinton. And the choice we are making today is who will best defend our values? Who will best defend your values and fight for you?I have to tell you, I cannot wait to stand on that stage with Hillary Clinton and say, "Madam Secretary, you are asking for a third term of a failed administration. You are asking for millions more to remain in stagnant jobs; for millions more steelworkers to be out of work; for wages to remain low; for young people not to have a future."We can do better. We can instead repeal Obamacare, abolish the IRS, unleash millions of jobs, defend the Bill of Rights, defend the Second Amendment and religious liberty, stand with our cops and our firefighters and our soldiers, and we can keep America safe.That's the choice I will put to her this fall. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~Yes, I would. And you know, I think this exchange actually highlights a real choice for Republican primary voters. When it comes to foreign policy, do you want to continue on the same basic trajectory as the last seven years of the Obama foreign policy? When it comes to these deals, Cuba and Iran, they were negotiated by Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.There's a real difference between us. Donald supported Hillary Clinton and John Kerry. And what he said right now is that he agrees in principle with what they're doing. The only thing he thinks is that they should negotiate a little bit better deals, they should be more effective. I have a fundamental disagreement and I think most Republicans and most Americans do, that we shouldn't be allowing billions of dollars to go to nations that hate us to go to Cuba, to go to Iran and to let them use those billions of dollars to try to murder us. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida~March 10, 2016~You know, we need a president who understands the national security interests of this country. The reason we are friends and allies with Israel is they are a liberal Democratic country that share our values, they're our strongest ally in the region.We get billions in intelligence resources, billions in military resources. And the Palestinian Authority that Donald, along with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama say they want to treat neutrally, the same as Israel. The Palestinian Authority is in a unity government with Hamas, a terrorist organization.They pay the families of these terrorists who murder people. And this is exactly the moral relativism Barack Obama has. And the answer is not scream, all Muslims bad.Let me give you an example of a Muslim for example, we ought to be standing with, President el-Sisi of Egypt, a president of a Muslim country who is targeting radical [bell rings] Islamic terrorist.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Everybody should pay the same proportion of what they make. You make $10 billion, you pay a billion. You make $10, you pay one. You get same rights and privileges.I don't see how anything gets a whole lot fairer than that. But you also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes because that is the thing that tilts it in one direction or another. And you have to set the rate at an appropriate level.Now I will say that, there are a lot of people who say, if you get rid of the deductions, you ruin the American dream because, you know, home mortgage deduction. But the fact of the matter is, people had homes before 1913 when we introduced the federal income tax, and later after that started deductions. And they say there will be no more charitable giving. We had churches before that and charitable organizations before that. The fact of the matter is, I believe if you put more money in people's pockets that they will actually be more generous rather than less generous. And it's  [applause]   the money that they earned. And, the other thing is, I do care about the poor people. And in the system that we're putting together, there will be a rebate for people at the poverty level. But I also want to emphasize the fact that as we get the economy moving, and I hope I get a question about how do we get the economy moving, there will be a lot more opportunities for poor people not to be poor people because this is America.This is the land of dreams. And our policies should be aimed at allowing people to realize that dream. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~I would have policies that wouldn't allow that to occur. I don't want to go in and tear anybody down. I mean, that doesn't help us. But what does help us is stop tinkering around the edges and fix the actual problems that exist that are creating the problem in the first place.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~I would not raise it. I would not raise it, specifically because I'm interested in making sure that people are able to enter the job market and take advantage of opportunities. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~In the two hours of this &mdash; of this debate, five people have died from drug-related deaths, $100 million has been added to our national debt, 200 babies have been killed by abortionists, and two veterans have taken their lives out of despair. This is a narrative that we can change, not we the Democrats, not we the Republicans, but we the people of America, because there is something special about this nation, and we must embrace it and be proud of it and never give it away for the sake of political correctness. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~The fact of the matter is, you know, what &mdash; we should vet all candidates. I have no problem with being vetted. What I do have a problem with is being lied about and then putting that out there as truth. [applause] And I don't even mind that so much, if they do it about &mdash; with everybody, like people on the other side. But, you know, when I look at somebody like Hillary Clinton, who sits there and tells her daughter and a government official that no, this was a terrorist attack, and then tells everybody else that it was a video.Where I came from, they call that a lie. And [cheering and applause]I think that's very different from, you know, somebody misinterpreting, when I said that I was offered a scholarship to West Point, that is the words that they used. But, I've had many people come and say the same thing to me.That is what people do in those situations. We have to start treating people the same, and finding out what people really think and what they're made of. People who know me know that I'm an honest person. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, first of all, delighted to be here. My family's here, and my little granddaughter, who's three years old, said she wanted to come to the debate. So this is very cool.As far as the minimum wage is concerned, people need to be educated on the minimum wage. Every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases.It's particularly a problem in the black community. Only 19.8 percent of black teenagers have a job, who are looking for one. You know, that &mdash; and that's because of those high wages. If you lower those wages, that comes down.You know, I can remember, as a youngster &mdash; you know, my first job working in a laboratory as a lab assistant, and multiple other jobs. But I would not have gotten those jobs if someone had to pay me a large amount of money.But what I did gain from those jobs is a tremendous amount of experience, and how to operate in the world and how to relate to different people, and how to become a responsible individual. And that's what gave me what I needed to ascend the ladder of opportunity in this country.That's what we need to be thinking about. How do we allow people to ascend the ladder of opportunity, rather than how do we give them everything and keep them dependent? [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, first of all, thank you not asking me what I said in the 10th grade. I appreciate that. [laughter and applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, I think we should have policies that don't allow them to just enlarge themselves at the expense of smaller entities. And certainly some of the policies, some of the monetary and Fed policies that we're using makes it very easy for them, makes it very easy for the big corporations, quite frankly, at these very low interest rates to buy back their stock and to drive the price of that up artificially. Those are the kinds of things that led to the problem in the first place.And I think this all really gets back to this whole regulation issue which is creating a very abnormal situation. This country was &mdash; declared its independence in 1776. In less than 100 years, it was the number-one economic power in the world. And the reason was because we had an atmosphere that encouraged entrepreneurial risk- taking and capital investment. Those are the fuels that drive it.And what we've done now is let the creep of regulation turn into a stampede of regulations, which is involved in every aspect of our lives. If we can get that out, it makes a big difference. And even for the average person, every single regulation costs money. And it's shifted to the individual.So &mdash; and it hurts the poor and the middle class much more than it does the rich. They go into the store and they buy a bar of soap, it costs 10 cents more, they notice it. And the middle class, when they come to the cash register, have a whole cart full of things that cost 5, 10 or 15 cents more, they notice it. It is hurting the poor.Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton won't tell you that that's the thing that's really hurting middle class in the core. They'll say it's the rich, take their money, but that won't help. You can take all of the rich's money and it won't make a dent in the problem that we're having. We have to come back to the fundamental principles that made America great. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, putting the special ops people in there is better than not having them there, because they &mdash; that's why they're called special ops, they're actually able to guide some of the other things that we're doing there.And what we have to recognize is that Putin is trying to really spread his influence throughout the Middle East. This is going to be his base. And we have to oppose him there in an effective way.We also must recognize that it's a very complex place. You know, the Chinese are there, as well as the Russians, and you have all kinds of factions there.What we've been doing so far is very ineffective, but we can't give up ground right there. But we have to look at this on a much more global scale. We're talking about global jihadists. And their desire is to destroy us and to destroy our way of life. So we have to be saying, how do we make them look like losers? Because that's the way that they're able to gather a lot of influence.And I think in order to make them look like losers, we have to destroy their caliphate. And you look for the easiest place to do that? It would be in Iraq. And if &mdash; outside of Anbar in Iraq, there's a big energy field. Take that from them. Take all of that land from them. We could do that, I believe, fairly easily, I've learned from talking to several generals, and then you move on from there.But you have to continue to face them, because our goal is not to contain them, but to destroy them before they destroy us. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, you know, when I say tithing, I'm talking about the concept of proportionality.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Absolutely
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Can I just &mdash; could I just say, as a chief executive who's had to make tough calls to save jobs and to grow jobs, I think what's interesting about Dodd-Frank is it's a great example of how socialism starts.Socialism starts when government creates a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem. Government created the problem. [applause]Government created the problem of a real estate boom. How did we create it? Under Republican and Democrats alike, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, everybody gathered together, Republicans and Democrats, and said, "home ownership is part of the American dream. Let's create a bubble," and then government stepped in &mdash; by the way, under president George W. Bush, banks were told &mdash; encouraged &mdash; told, really &mdash; to buy other banks, to take money.And now what do we have with Dodd-Frank? The classic of crony capitalism. The big have gotten bigger, 1,590 community banks have gone out of business, and on top of all that, we've created something called the Consumer Financial Production Bureau, a vast bureaucracy with no congressional oversight that's digging through hundreds of millions of your credit records to detect fraud.This is how socialism starts, ladies and gentlemen. We must take our government back. [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Cut where you need to, and invest where you need to

Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Imagine a Clinton presidency. Our military will continue to deteriorate. Our veterans will not be cared for. And, no, Mrs. Clinton, that situation is not exaggerated. The rich will get richer. The poor will get poorer. The middle class will continue to get crushed.And as bad as that picture is, what's even worse is that a Clinton presidency will corrode the character of this nation. Why? Because of the Clinton way: Say whatever you have to, lie as long as you can get away with it.We must beat Hillary Clinton. Carly Fiorina can beat Hillary Clinton. I will beat Hillary Clinton. And under a President Fiorina, we will restore the character of this nation, the security of this nation, the prosperity of this nation, because as citizens, we will take our government back. [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Ronald Reagan walked away at Reykjavik.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Sorry, I can't hear you.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~that we have information to shop wisely for our health care.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~The alternative is to allow states to manage high risk pools for those who really need help. Look, I'm a cancer survivor, OK? I understand that you cannot have someone who's battled cancer just become known as a pre-existing condition. I understand that you cannot allow families to go bankrupt if they truly need help. But, I also understand that Obamacare isn't helping anyone.We're throwing more, and more people into Medicaid, and fewer, and fewer doctors are taking those payments. The point is Obamacare is crushing small businesses, it is not helping the families it was intended to help. So, let us allow states to manage high risk pools. Let us try the one thing in health insurance we've never tried, the free market. Let us ensure that as patients, and customers
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~The two go hand in hand
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~This is why &mdash; this is why we must combine, actually, zero-based budgeting with tax reform because unless we can examine, and cut, and move, every single dollar of discretionary spending in the federal government, we cannot reform taxes and reduce spending at the same time.Ask yourself this question, how is it possible that the federal government gets more money each and every year, which the federal government has been doing, receiving more money every year for 50 years under republicans and democrats alike, and yet, never has enough money to do the important things?The answer? All the money's always spoken for. All the money's spoken for. So, we have to go to zero-based budgeting, which is a simple idea &mdash; by the way, there's been a bill for zeros-based (ph) budgeting  [bell ringing]  It exists, it can be voted on. Every dollar must be examined. Any dollar can be cut. Any dollar can be cut, any dollar can be moved. We have to go to a three page tax code. You lower every rate, you close every loophole, why? Because the government uses the tax code to decide winners, and losers. You have to strip the corruption out of the tax code to pay for it. You have to know where every single dollar is being spent
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~we have the strongest military on the face of the planet, and everyone has to know it.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, first Obamacare has to be repealed because it's failing  [applause] it's failing the very people it was intended to help, but, also, it is croney-capitalism at its worst. Who helped write this bill? Drug companies, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, every single one of those kinds of companies are bulking up to deal with big government. See, that's what happens. As government gets bigger, and bigger &mdash; and it has been for 50 years under republicans and democrats alike &mdash; and business have to bulk up to deal with big government.So, we have to repeal it. It's tens of thousands of pages long, no one can possible understand it except the big companies, the lawyers, the accountants, the lobbyists that they hire to protect their interests. Then, we have to give back to states the responsibility to manage a high risk pool. We need to try the one thing in health insurance we've never tried. Health insurance has always been a cozy, little game between regulators and health insurance companies.We need to try the free market. The free market. Where people actually have to compete. [applause]And, we 'ought to have the government ensure that you must &mdash; and I don't use that term often, that government 'ought to do something, but every healthcare provider 'ought to publish its costs, its prices, its outcomes, because as patients we don't know what we're buying. [applause] Now, let me just say &mdash; let me just say, I know more about innovation and entrepreneurship than anyone on this panel because I have led innovative businesses in the most highly competitive industry in the world for decades. The truth is the secret sauce of America is innovation, and entrepreneurship, it is why we must cut our government down to size, and hold it accountable. It's why we have to take our government back, because innovation and entrepreneurship is crushed by the crushing load of a 73,000 page tax code. It is crushed  [bell ringing] by regulatory thicket that is so vast we don't even know what's in it anymore. It is crushed as well by government bureaucrats who don't do their jobs very well, and who are not held accountable, which is why I've said we got to take our government back, and to do that, we have to know where every dollar being spent, and be able to move any dollar. We have to hack through this regulatory thicket, repeal so much, but, also, know what's in that regulatory thicket &mdash; we don't even know what regulations have been passed.Third, we need to build a meritocracy &mdash; Scott Walker, by the way, is trying now to do in Wisconsin  [bell ringing] Finally, we need to get to a three page tax code, and, yes, that plan exists.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, first of all, I must say as I think about that question, I think about a woman I met the other day. I would guess she was 40 years old. She had several children. And she said to me, you know, Carly, I go to bed every night afraid for my children's future. And that really struck me. This is America. A mother is going to bed afraid for her children's future.And the reason she's afraid for her children's future is because we've had problems for a long time. Yes, problems have gotten much worse under Democrats. But the truth is, this government has been growing bigger and bigger, more corrupt, less effective, crushing the engine of economic growth for a very long time. This isn't about just replacing a Democrat with a Republican now. It's about actually challenging the status quo of big government.Big government has created a big business called politics. And there are lots of people invested in the status quo of that big business called politics. Specifically, we need actually to do five things to really get this economy going again. We need to go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dollar is being spent, we can challenge any dollar, cut any dollar, move any dollar. [applause]We need to actually reform the tax code. Go to a three-page tax code. Yes, there are plans that would reform our tax code to three pages. In addition to rolling back what President Obama has done, we need to do a top-to-bottom review of every single regulation on the books. That hasn't been done in 50 years. We need to pass the REINS Act so Congress is in charge of regulation, not nameless, faceless bureaucrats accountable to no one. We've become a nation of rules, not a nation of laws.And finally we actually, yes, have to hold government officials accountable for their performance. All this has to be done, and the citizens of this nation must help a President Fiorina get it done. We must take our government back. [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~when it was time to quit talking
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Yes, the middle ground is this
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~You know, Mr. Trump fancies himself a very good negotiator. And, I accept that he's done a lot of good deals, so, Mr. Trump 'ought to know that we should not speak to people from a position of weakness. Senator Paul should know that as well.One of the reasons I've said that I would not be talking to Vladimir Putin right now, although I have met him as well, not in a green room for a show, but in a private meeting. [laughter, applause, and cheering] One of the reasons I've said I wouldn't be talking to Vladimir Putin right now is because we are speaking to him from a position of weakness brought on by this administration, so, I wouldn't talk to him for awhile, but, I would do this. I would start rebuilding the Sixth Fleet right under his nose, rebuilding the military &mdash; the missile defense program in Poland right under his nose. I would conduct very aggressive military exercises in the Baltic States so that he understood we would protect our NATO allies  [bell ringing]  and I might also put in a few more thousand troops into Germany, not to start a war, but to make sure that Putin understand that the United States of America will stand with our allies. That is why Governor Bush is correct. We must have a no fly zone in Syria because Russia cannot tell the United States of America where and when to fly our planes. We also have a set of allies  [applause]  We also have a set of allies in the Arab Middle East that know that ISIS is their fight. They have asked us specifically over, and over again to support them. King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a very long time, has asked us for bombs and material, we have not provided it. The Egyptians are asking us to share intelligence, we are not, I will. The Kurds have asked us to arm them for three years, we are not, I would. The Egyptians, the Saudis, the Kuwaitis, the Bahrain's, the Emirati, the Kurds  [bell ringing]  all of these, I know, by the way, understand ISIS is their fight, but they must see leadership support and resolve from the United States of America

Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~All I can say is, you're lucky in Ohio that you struck oil. That is for one thing. [laughter]Let me just tell you that Dwight Eisenhower, good president, great president, people liked him. "I like Ike," right? The expression. "I like Ike." Moved a 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country, moved them just beyond the border. They came back. Moved them again beyond the border, they came back. Didn't like it. Moved them way south. They never came back. [laughter] Dwight Eisenhower. You don't get nicer. You don't get friendlier. They moved a 1.5 million out. We have no choice. We have no choice.[crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~And as you understand, I mean, you understand very well from the Wall Street Journal, currency manipulation is the single great weapon people have. They don't even discuss it in this agreement.So I say, it's a very bad deal, should not be approved. If it is approved, it will just be more bad trade deals, more loss of jobs for our country. We are losing jobs like nobody's ever lost jobs before. I want to bring jobs back into this country.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Assad is a bad guy, but we have no idea who the so-called rebels &mdash; I read about the rebels, nobody even knows who they are. I spoke to a general two weeks ago, he said &mdash; he was very up on exactly what we're talking about. He said, "You know, Mr. Trump? We're giving hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment to these people, we have no idea who they are."So, I don't like Assad. Who's going to like Assad? But, we have no idea who these people, and what they're going to be, and what they're going to represent. They may be far worse than Assad. Look at Libya. Look at Iraq. Look at the mess we have after spending $2 trillion dollars, thousands of lives, wounded warriors all over the place &mdash; who I love, OK? All over. We have nothing. And, I said, keep the oil. And we should have kept the oil, believe me. We should have kept the oil. And, you know what? We should have given the oil  [bell ringing] ..We should've given big chunks to the people that lost their arms, their legs, and their families, and their sons, and daughters, because right now, you know who has a lot of that oil? Iran, and ISIS.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~built an unbelievable company worth billions and billions of dollars. I don't have to hear from this man, believe me. I don't have to hear from him.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~I can't be Neil. And the and the reason I can't be is that we are a country that is being beaten on every front economically, militarily. There is nothing that we do now to win. We don't win anymore. Our taxes are too high. I've come up with a tax plan that many, many people like very much. It's going to be a tremendous plan. I think it'll make our country and our economy very dynamic.But, taxes too high, wages too high, we're not going to be able to compete against the world. I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is. People have to go out, they have to work really hard and have to get into that upper stratum. But we can not do this if we are going to compete with the rest of the world. We just can't do it.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~I was so happy yesterday when I saw that decision come down. That was an unbelievable decision. [applause]And we don't have enough of those decisions coming down. He of the executive order, because nobody wants to listen to him, including the Democrats, so he just goes around signing executive orders. That was a great day. And, frankly, we have to stop illegal immigration. It's hurting us economically. It's hurting us from every standpoint. It's causing tremendous difficulty with respect to drugs and what that does to many of our inner cities in particular.And it really is &mdash; was such an unbelievable moment because the courts have not been ruling in our favor. And it was a 2-1 decision. And it was a terrific thing that happened. And I will tell you, we are a country of laws. We need borders. We will have a wall. The wall will be built. The wall will be successful. And if you think walls don't work, all you have to do is ask Israel. The wall works, believe me. Properly done. Believe me. [cheering and applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~I would not do it. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~It's a horrible deal
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Maria, we're a country of laws. We either have a country or we don't have a country. We are a country of laws. Going to have to go out and they will come back but they are going to have to go out and hopefully they get back. But we have no choice if we're going to run our country properly and if we're going to be a country. [cheering and applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~No, I'm sorry. No, excuse me. I was there.

Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Please, if I could just
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Thank you. Over the years, I've created tens of thousands of jobs and a great company. It's a company I'm very proud of. Some of the most iconic assets anywhere in the world. And I will tell you, I don't have to give you a website because I'm self-funding my campaign. I'm putting up my own money.I want to do something really special. I want to make our country greater than it's ever been. I think we have that potential. We cannot lose this election. We cannot let Hillary Clinton, who is the worst secretary of state in the history of our country, win this election.We will fight. We will win. And we truly will make this even more special. We have to make it better than ever before. And I will tell you, the United States can actually be better than ever before. Thank you.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~The TPP is horrible deal. It is a deal that is going to lead to nothing but trouble. It's a deal that was designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone. It's 5,600 pages long. So complex that nobodies read it. It's like Obamacare; nobody ever read it. They passed it; nobody read it. And look at mess we have right now. And it will be repealed.But this is one of the worst trade deals. And I would, yes, rather not have it. With all of these countries, and all of the bad ones getting advantage and taking advantage of what the good ones would normally get, I'd rather make individual deals with individual countries. We will do much better. We lose a fortune on trade. The United States loses with everybody. We're losing now over $500 billion in terms of imbalance with China, $75 billion a year imbalance with Japan. By the way, Mexico, $50 billion a year imbalance.So I must say, Gerard, I just think it's a terrible deal. I love trade. I'm a free trader, 100 percent. But we need smart people making the deals, and we don't have smart people making the deals.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~They blew up &mdash; hold it .
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~They blew up, wait a minute  [audience reaction]  They blew up a Russian airplane. He cannot be in love with these people. He's going in, and we can go in, and everybody should go in. As far as the Ukraine is concerned, we have a group of people, and a group of countries, including Germany &mdash; tremendous economic behemoth &mdash; why are we always doing the work?We are &mdash; I'm all for protecting Ukraine and working &mdash; but, we have countries that are surrounding the Ukraine that aren't doing anything. They say, "Keep going, keep going, you dummies, keep going. Protect us " [bell ringing]  And we have to get smart. We can't continue to be the policeman of the world. We are $19 trillion dollars, we have a country that's going to hell, we have an infrastructure that's falling apart. Our roads, our bridges, our schools, our airports, and we have to start investing money in our country. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~We are not.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~We have millions of people right now on line trying to come into this country. Very, very unfair to the people that want to come into our country legally. They've gone through the process. They're on line. They're waiting. Very, very unfair to them. That I can tell you. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~We have to make our military bigger, better, stronger than ever before so that nobody messes with us, and a long run, it's going to save us. I agree with Marco, I agree with Ted, we have no choice. And, I can tell you this with certainty. We all have a different tax plan. Some I don't totally agree with.One thing we understand, each one of those tax plans is better than the mess that we have right now. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, first of all, it's not only Russia. We have problems with North Korea where they actually have nuclear weapons. You know, nobody talks about it, we talk about Iran, and that's one of the worst deals ever made. One of the worst contracts ever signed, ever, in anything, and it's a disgrace. But, we have somebody over there, a madman, who already has nuclear weapons we don't talk about that. That's a problem.China is a problem, both economically in what they're doing in the South China Sea, I mean, they are becoming a very, very major force. So, we have more than just Russia. But, as far as the Ukraine is concerned, and you could Syria &mdash; as far as Syria, I like &mdash; if Putin wants to go in, and I got to know him very well because we were both on 60 Minutes, we were stablemates, and we did very well that night.But, you know that.But, if Putin wants to go and knocked the hell out of ISIS, I am all for it, 100%, and I can't understand how anybody would be against it
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, what's happening right now, Neil, is something that not been a subject of conversation by politicians. As primarily the only politician, I guess other than Carly on the stage, they haven't talked about a corporate inversion. A corporate inversion &mdash; companies are leaving. You know, we used to leave New York to go to Florida. We got better taxes, we got, maybe, something else.Now, they're the United States to go to other countries. They have trillions of dollars in those other countries. They're going for two reasons, they can't get their money back in. It's something where the democrats and the republicans both agree, it's the only thing I can think of. They both agree, let the money come back in.Three and a half years, they still can't make a deal. They can't get the money in. It's probably two and a half trillion, but, I think it's much more than that. All of that money could become &mdash; could come right in and be used to rebuild our country, and investments in our country. They can't do it. What we have to do, and what I've done, is made the tax rate &mdash; and one of the reasons they don't [inaudible] the taxes so obnoxious, they can't do it.Where, I made it a 10% number, as you know. I've been very highly praised for it. A lot of money's going to come back in, we're going to get rid of the bureaucratic problems, and roadblocks, because that's also a problem. And, we're going to have all of this money pour back into the United States. It's going to be used to build businesses, for jobs, and everything else.And, as I say, my expression is, let's make America great again. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Why does she keep interrupting everybody? [laughter] Terrible. [booing]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Yeah
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Yes
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Yes.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Yes. Well, the currency manipulation they don't discuss in the agreement, which is a disaster. If you look at the way China and India and almost everybody takes advantage of the United States &mdash; China in particular, because they're so good. It's the number-one abuser of this country. And if you look at the way they take advantage, it's through currency manipulation. It's not even discussed in the almost 6,000-page agreement. It's not even discussed.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~You are going to have to bring people &mdash; you are going to have to send people out. Look, we're a country
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~[inaudible]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Donald &mdash; Donald's wrong on this. He is absolutely wrong on this. We're not going to be the world's policeman, but we sure as heck better be the world's leader. That's &mdash; there's a huge difference where, without us leading  [cheering]  voids are filled, and the idea that it's a good idea for Putin to be in Syria, let ISIS take out Assad, and then Putin will take out ISIS? I mean, that's like a board game, that's like playing Monopoly or something. That's not how the real world works. We have to lead, we have to be involved. We should have a no fly zone in Syria. There are &mdash; they are barrel bombing the innocents in that country. If you're a Christian, increasingly in Lebanon, or Iraq, or Syria, you're going to be beheaded. And, if you're a moderate Islamist, you're not going to be able to survive either.We have to play a role in this be able to bring the rest of the world to this issue before it's too late.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~First of all, we could get to 4 percent growth. The new normal of 2 percent puts huge demands on government. The reason why we have structural deficits is that more and more people are relying on government and the growth that we don't have makes &mdash; makes the deficit grow.A 4 percent growth strategy starts with tax reform. And the proposal that I've laid out is the one the Wall Street Journal editorial board has said is the most pro-growth of all the proposals out there. We cut the &mdash; we eliminate a lot of deductions and cut the rates down. A corporate rate of 20 percent, which puts us 5 percent above &mdash; below that of China, and allows us full expensing of investing. It would create an explosion of investment back into this country, creating higher-wage jobs, and so that's part of it.On the regulatory side I think we need to repeal every rule that Barack Obama has in terms of work in progress, every one of them. [applause]And start over. For those that are already in existence, the regulation of the Internet, we have to start over, but we ought to do that.The clean power act, we ought to repeal that and &mdash; and start over on that. The waters of the United States act, which is going to be devastating for agriculture and many industries, we should repeal that. We should repeal the rules because the economic costs of this far exceed the social benefit. And if we're serious about being serious about high growth, then we have to recognize that small businesses right now, more of them are closing than &mdash; than are &mdash; than are being set up. Hillary Clinton has said that Barack Obama's policies get an A. Really? One in 10 people right now aren't working or have given up altogether, as you said. That's not an A. One in seven people are living in poverty. That's not an A. One in five children are on food stamps. That is not an A. It may be the best that Hillary Clinton can do, but it's not the best America can do. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~I'm gonna fight as hard as I can to make sure that we shift power away from Washington, simplify the tax code, to spur economic activity in this country. Of course it's the highest priority.If we don't do that, we're stuck with the "new normal" of 2 percent growth. Hillary Clinton says, basically, we just gotta get used to it. Two percent growth means declining income for the middle class. It means more than 6 million people are stuck in poverty than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated.It means &mdash; it means more demands on government &mdash; growing the economy is the first job, if we're going to be serious about dealing with the deficit and debt. And more importantly, people are really struggling right now.In this economy, the disposable income of the great middle is down 2,300 bucks. So yeah, we've created jobs, your &mdash; argue (ph) &mdash; brought that up early, and it was a good question. Jobs are being created, but they're lower-income jobs than the jobs that were lost.And the net effect of this is we need to jump-start the economy. I think of Jonathan (ph) and Reagan Love (ph), who are supporters of mine. Jonathan has been deployed by the National Guard, he is &mdash; he's in Oklahoma.Reagan Love &mdash; by the way, pretty great name, I think &mdash; is a teacher. When &mdash; if they had this tax cut, what they told me was that that $2,300 of money in their pocket &mdash; they would go back to South Carolina and start a business.Imagine what it would be like, instead of having more businesses closed than started, we had it the exact opposite. We would grow our economy, and the government would get the revenue necessary to make things &mdash; make things better.Hillary Clinton's approach to this is more top-down, more regulation, more taxes, more government, and it will destroy our economy.

Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~I got about four minutes in the last debate. I'm going to get my question right now.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~It is &mdash; I'd say it is Islamic terrorism, and, back to the question of what we are dealing with in Iraq, when we pull back voids are filled. That's the lesson of history, and, sadly, this president does not believe in American leadership. He does not believe it, and the net result is that we have a caliphate the size of Indiana that gains energy each and everyday to recruit Americans in our own country, and the threat to the homeland relates to the fact that we have not dealt with this threat of terror in the Middle East.We should have a no fly zone in Syria. We should have a support for the remnants of the Syrian Free Army, and create safe zones. If you want to deal with the four million refugees that are leaving Syria because of the devastation there, then we 'ought to create safe zones for them to stay in the region rather than go to Europe. And, that requires American leadership.Without American leadership every other country in the neighborhood beings to change their priorities. It is tragic that you see Iraq, and other countries now talking to Russia. It wasn't that long ago that Russia had no influence in the region at all. And, so, the United States needs to lead across the board.This president, and Hillary Clinton both do not believe the United States has a leadership role to play, and we're now paying a price, and it will have a huge impact on the economy of this country if we don't deal with this. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Jane Horton is sitting with my wife here today. Her husband, Chris, was killed in action in Afghanistan. And Jane spends her time now defending and fighting for military families. They're both heroes.I don't think we need an agitator-in-chief or a divider-in-chief. We need a commander-in-chief that will rebuild our military and restore respect to our veterans by revamping and fixing a broken Veterans Administration, That's my pledge to you. I ask for your support. Thank you. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Maria? [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~No, I can't say that. But I can say, if you created higher capital requirements, that's the solution to this, not having concentration of assets. The bigger banks now have more and more control over &mdash; over the financial assets of this country. And that is the wrong approach to take.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Thank you, Donald, for allowing me to speak at the debate. That's really nice of you. Really appreciate that. [applause]What a generous man you are. Twelve million illegal immigrants, to send them back, 500,000 a month, is just not &mdash; not possible. And it's not embracing American values. And it would tear communities apart. And it would send a signal that we're not the kind of country that I know America is.And even having this conversation sends a powerful signal &mdash; they're doing high-fives in the Clinton campaign right now when they hear this. That's the problem with this. We have to win the presidency. And the way you win the presidency is to have practical plans. Lay them out there. What we need to do is allow people to earn legal status where they pay a fine, where they work, where they don't commit crimes, where they learn English, and over an extended period of time, they earn legal status. That's the path &mdash; a proper path  [applause][crosstalk]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~They're not doing that
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~We're not &mdash; we shouldn't have another financial crisis. What we ought to do is raise the capital requirements so banks aren't too big to fail. Dodd-Frank has actually done the opposite, totally the opposite, where banks now have higher concentration of risk in assets and the capital requirements aren't high enough. If we were serious about it, we would raise the capital requirements and lessen the load on the community banks and other financial institutions. This vast overreach has created a huge problem for our country, and Hillary Clinton wants to double down on that.I was in Washington, Iowa, about three months ago talking about how bad Washington, D.C., is. It was &mdash; get the &mdash; kind of the &mdash; anyway. We had  [laughter]It &mdash; and I talked to a banker there. This is a bank that had $125 million of assets, four branches. Their compliance costs because of Dodd-Frank went from $100,000 to $600,000 in a two-year period. The net effect of that is &mdash; and they had &mdash; they had not one loan that went bad during the financial crisis. They knew &mdash; they knew their borrowers. They gave back to the community. They were engaged in the community. And imagine America without its community banks. Well, that's what's happening because of Dodd-Frank. That's &mdash; that's my worry. My worry is that the real economy has been hurt by the vast overreach of the Obama administration.And Hillary Clinton, she wants to double down on that. She wants to create even more so. She is a captive of the left of her party to the point now where she is &mdash; she was for the trade agreement in &mdash; the Pacific agreement. Now she's against it. She was &mdash; hinted she was for the XL pipeline. Now she's opposed to it. All the things that would create sustained economic growth she's now doubling down against it.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~We've had a 10% reduction in carbon emissions, and it isn't because of Solyndra. It isn't because of the central planners in Washington D.C. It's because we've had a great American success story, the explosion of natural gas.Taking two existing technologies, and applying it through innovation has created lower carbon emissions, lower energy costs &mdash; 40% of all the economic activity in the age of Obama has come from the energy sector, and Hillary Clinton wants to suppress that. We &mdash; I think we ought to be expanding this. High growth is the path to lower carbon, and more jobs.I know for a fact, as Governor of the State of Florida, we created the largest land purchasing programs, and environment clean-up programs because we had a growing economy. Our revenues were growing at 4.4%. It allowed for resources to be able to protect the natural system.We got to get to a conservation  [bell ringing]  in environmental policy that goes beyond just carbon
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Yes.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~You've already made two comments, John. It's my turn.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~You could, if you were serious about
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~As an executive &mdash; no. As an executive, I would figure out how to separate those people who can afford it versus those people, or the hard-working folks who put those money in those institutions [booing]  let me &mdash; no, no. Let me say another thing. Here's what I mean by that. Here's what I mean by that.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~because if during &mdash; well, I'll tell you what (ph).  CRUZ:  What would you do if the bank was failing? I would not let the people who put their money in there all go down.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Can we comment on that?
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Excuse me.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~First of all, let me just say that, in the state of Ohio &mdash; and I'm the only acting executive on &mdash; on this stage today &mdash; we do have a moderate increase in the minimum wage. And I got to tell you, my father carried mail on his back. His father was a coal miner. He died of black lung. He was losing his eyesight. My mother's mother lived with us. She could barely speak English. I come from a town where if the wind blew the wrong way, people found themselves out of work. An economic theory is fine, but you know what? People need help.Now, I have a plan that, in fact, would cut taxes, but not $11 trillion or $12 trillion that would put my children further in debt. I have a plan that would not only cut taxes, lower the income tax rate for individuals, lower the tax for businesses so businesses will compete here and not move operations overseas, and also a plan &mdash; the only plan of anybody standing on this stage to get us to a balanced budget by the end of a second term.And, you know, the simple fact of the matter is, we hear a lot of promises in this debate, a lot of promises about these tax cuts or tax schemes sometimes that I call them. Hillary and the Democrats promise everything on the spending side. We've got to be responsible about what we propose on the tax side.Yes, lower taxes, lower spending. My website, JohnKasich.com, will show you exactly how we balance the budget. I balanced the budget in Washington as a chief architect, and I have balanced it in Ohio for one reason. When you balance the budget and you cut taxes, people get work.And our most important moral purpose as leaders in the political system is to make sure we create an environment for job creation so people can live their dreams and realize their God-given potential. That's why it's so important.And for those at the bottom, we've got to do what we can to train them so they can move up. But to just look the other way is not acceptable, because, you know what, as the governor of Ohio I have to deal with real challenges, and we've gotten it done in our state, and I will do it for America. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~I'll do it in Washington. I've done it twice; I'll do it thrice for the United States of America.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~I'm gonna tell you this. Let me tell you this. If during &mdash; if during
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~I appreciate it, Jeb. I'm all of you. But I want at some point to talk about a value-added tax and $11 trillion, $12 trillion tax cuts that will put our kids way deeper in the hole than they have been at this point. So I would like to talk about it at some point, because that's what leadership is.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~I think you were coming to me and then
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~I wouldn't. I wouldn't.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~In the state of Ohio, the state of Ohio, we have grown 347,000 jobs. Our unemployment is half of what it was. Our fracking industry, energy industry may have contributed 20,000, but if Mr. Trump understood that the real jobs come in the downstream, not in the upstream, but in the downstream. And that's where we're going to get our jobs.But Ohio is diversified. And little false little things, sir, they don't really work when it comes to the truth. So the fact is, all I'm suggesting, we can't ship 11 million people out of this country. Children would be terrified, and it will not work.[crosstalk]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Jerry, Gerald, it was an attack.[crosstalk]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Let me &mdash; let me also say, Gary &mdash; Gary, let me also say, Jeb is &mdash; what Jeb is talking about with the big banks is to force them to reserve their capital, people who invest it and they hold their capital, so that if the bank goes down, the people who are invested in the bank are the ones that pay. That's what he's trying to say.Secondly, I'll tell you about Wall Street: There's too much greed. And the fact is, a free enterprise system is a system that's produced the greatest wealth for the world. But you know Michael Novak, the great Catholic theologian, says that a free enterprise system that is not underlaid with values &mdash; and we should all think about the way we conduct our lives &mdash; yes, free enterprise is great, profits are great, but there have to be some values that underlay it, and they need a good ethics lesson on Wall Street on a regular basis to keep them in check so we, the people, do not lose.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Let me tell you this, Mr. Baker, in terms of the cyber attacks, we have the capability to not only have a defensive posture, but it also to make it clear to people that if you attack us with cyber attacks, we will destroy the mechanisms that you are using to attack us.I want to give you a little trip around the world. I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years. In the Ukraine, arm the people there so they can fight for themselves. In the eastern part of Europe, make sure that Finland and the Baltics know that if the Russians move, we move.In Syria, yes, a no-fly zone in the north on the Turkish border, a no-fly zone on the south on the Jordanian border. Anybody flies in the first time, maybe they can fly out. They fly in there a second time, they will not fly out.And it also becomes a sanctuary for the people to be. And it also sends many messages in the Middle East that we're still involved.Saudi Arabia, cut off the funding for the radical clerics, the ones that preach against us. But they're fundamentally our friends. Jordan, we want the king to reign for 1,000 years. Egypt, they have been our ally and a moderating force in the Middle East throughout their history.In the groups &mdash; in the countries of the Gulf states of Bahrain, the Cleveland Clinic is opening an operation. Clearly we see the same with them. And in Israel, we have no better ally in the world, and no more criticizing them in public, we should support them.And finally China, China doesn't own the South China Sea, and I give the president some credit for being able to move a naval force in there to let the Chinese know that we're not going to put up with it any more.And in the trade agreement, the TPP, it's critical to us, not only for economic reasons and for jobs, because there are so many people who are connected to getting jobs because of trade, but it allows us to create not only economy alliances, but also potentially strategic alliances against the Chinese. They are not our enemy, but they are certainly not our friend.And finally, I will say to everyone in this room, we have been talking about taxes and economics. When the fall comes, and we run against Hillary, which will be a disaster if she got elected. I have two 16-year-old girls, and I want this country to be strong.We make promises we can't keep under the bright light of the fall, we will have trouble. We must make sure that economic programs and our military programs are solid. I served in Washington as the chairman of the Budget Committee, and we got the budget balanced.And in Ohio, as the CEO, and guess what, we have got to have a CEO mentality and a way to beat Hillary Clinton and the Democracies in the fall. And our ideas have to add up. They have to be solid. And people have to know we have the confidence to lead America.And as president, I will lead this country, as I have before in Washington and in Ohio, and will return both on domestic and international affairs. And I appreciate the opportunity to speak this time, Gerry. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Look, I hate to crash the party to you, Mr. Baker, but, you know, what's fair
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Maria, can we comment on that?
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Mr. Baker, everybody got to talk about taxes
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Neil, that's the difference of being an executive. And let me just explain: when a bank is ready to go under and depositors are getting ready to lose their life savings, you just don't say we believe in philosophical concerns. You know what an executive has to decide? When there's a water crisis, how do we get water to the city? When there's a school shooting, how do you get there and help heal a community? When there are financial crisis, or a crisis with ebola, you got to go there and try to fix it.Philosophy doesn't work when you run something. And I gotta tell you, on-the-job training for president of the United States doesn't work. We've done it for 8 years, &mdash; and almost 8 years now. It does not work. [applause]We need an executive who's been tried, has been tested, and judge the decisions that that executive makes. I don't like what the Fed is doing, but I'll tell you what worries me more than anything else: turning the Fed over to the Congress of the United States
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~No. No, I didn't say that.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~so they can print the money. That would be a very bad approach.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Sure. We would move the Medicare system from a 7 percent growth down to about a 5 percent growth. And I have a whole series of ways to do that. In Ohio, we reduced Medicaid funding for the poor from 10 percent to 2.5 percent, didn't cut one benefit or didn't take anybody off the rolls. Why? Because we're innovators. I've been an innovator my entire career. And I really don't care what special interests or lobbyists have to say. I have a job to do when I take over a public office. Now, we freeze non-defense discretionary for eight years. We also put an increase in defense spending. Our tax cuts balance out. And at the end of the day, we will get to a balanced budget.And I want everybody here to know, when I was Budget Committee chairman in Washington, I stepped on every toe in that town, and we got to a balanced budget, and we had enormous job growth. And as governor of Ohio, we went from 350,000 lost jobs to a gain of 347,000 jobs.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~They were &mdash; they were talking about what you would do with depositors. Would you let these banks shut down?My argument is, going forward, the banks have to reserve the capital, so that the &mdash; so that the people who own the capital start pressuring the banks to not take these risky approaches, Ted.But at the end of the day
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, ladies and gentlemen, if Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders were to win this election, my 16-year-olds, I &mdash; I worry about what their life is going to be like.You know, the conservative movement is all about opportunity. It is about lower taxes. It's about balanced budgets. It's about less regulation. And it's about sending power, money and influence back to where we live so we can run America from the bottom up.In addition to that, once we have the power and the money and the influence with programs we shift out, that each of us have a responsibility to reach out and to rebuild our families, make them stronger, and connect our neighborhoods. All that together &mdash; wealth, connection, family &mdash; America's greatest days are ahead. We must win this election. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, look, in 1986 Ronald Reagan basically said the people who were here, if they were law-abiding, could stay. But, what didn't happen is we didn't build the walls effectively and we didn't control the border. We need to. We need to control our border just like people have to control who goes in and out of their house.But if people think that we are going to ship 11 million people who are law-abiding, who are in this country, and somehow pick them up at their house and ship them out of Mexico &mdash; to Mexico, think about the families. Think about the children.So, you know what the answer really is? If they have been law- abiding, they pay a penalty. They get to stay. We protect the wall. Anybody else comes over, they go back.But for the 11 million people, come on, folks. We all know you can't pick them up and ship them across, back across the border. It's a silly argument. It is not an adult argument. It makes no sense. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~When you are faced &mdash; when you are faced, in the last financial crisis, with banks going under &mdash; with banks going under, and people, people who put their &mdash; their life savings in there, you got to deal with it. You can't turn a blind eye to it.Now, going forward, that's one thing. If you had another financial crisis, perhaps there would be an effort to make sure that we do (ph).
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Yeah, I would like to make a comment.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Yes, sir
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~are you talking about the military, Rand?
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Because
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Can I just add what &mdash; he's right on point there. Do you know why these banks are so big? The government made them big. The government made them big by adding thousands and thousands of pages of regulations. So the big banks, they have an army of lawyers, they have an army of compliance officers. They can deal with all these things. The small banks, like Governor Bush was saying, they can't deal with all these regulations. They can't deal with all &mdash; they cannot hire the fanciest law firm in Washington or the best lobbying firm to deal with all these regulations. And so the result is, the big banks get bigger, the small banks struggle to lend or even exist, and the result is what you have today.And in Dodd-Frank, you have actually codified too big to fail. We have actually created a category of systemically important institutions, and these banks go around bragging about it. You know what they say to people with a wink and a nod? We are so big, we are so important that if we get in trouble, the government has to bail us out. This is an outrage. We need to repeal Dodd-Frank as soon as possible. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~I do want to rebuild the American military.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~I know that Rand is a committed isolationist. I'm not. I believe the world is a stronger and a better place, when the United States is the strongest military power in the world.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~I need to add a couple of points to this. The first is, I've never met Vladimir Putin, but I know enough about him to know he is a gangster. He is basically an organized crime figure that runs a country, controls a $2 trillion economy. And is using to build up his military in a rapid way despite the fact his economy is a disaster.He understands only geopolitical strength. And every time he has acted anywhere in the world, whether it's in Ukraine or Georgia before that, or now in the Middle East, it's because he is trusting in weakness.His calculation in the Middle East is that he has seen what this president has done, which is nothing, the president has no strategy, our allies in the region do not trust us. For goodness sake, there is only one pro-American free enterprise democracy in the Middle East, it is the state of Israel. And we have a president that treats the prime minister of Israel with less respect than what he gives the ayatollah in Iran. And so our allies in the region don't trust us. [cheering and applause]Vladimir Putin is exploiting that weakness, for purposes of edging the Americans out as the most important geopolitical power broker in the region. And we do have a vested interest. And here's why.Because all those radical terrorist groups that, by the way, are not just in Syria and in Iraq, ISIS is now in Libya. They are a significant presence in Libya, and in Afghanistan, and a growing presence in Pakistan.Soon they will be in Turkey. They will try Jordan. They will try Saudi Arabia. They are coming to us. They recruit Americans using social media. And they don't hate us simply because we support Israel. They hate us because of our values. They hate us because our girls go to school. They hate us because women drive in the United States. Either they win or we win, and we had better take this risk seriously, it is not going away on its own. [cheering and applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Now I get my 60 seconds to respond. He's talking about my tax plan.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Ours &mdash; the story of America is an extraordinary story. It is the story of a nation that for over two centuries each generation has left the next better off than themselves. But now, because Washington is out of touch, for the fault of both political parties, for the first time in our history, that is in doubt.And that is what this election must be about, because if the next four years are anything like the last eight years, our children will be the first Americans ever left worse off by their parents. This election is about making a different choice, about applying our principles of limited government and free enterprise to the unique issues of our time. And if we do, we will not just save the American dream. We will expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before. And the 21st century can be a new American century.So tonight, I ask you for your vote and I ask you to join us at my website, marcorubio.com. [laughter and applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~So let me begin with this. I actually believe &mdash; first of all, this is their money. They do pay. It is refundable, not just against the taxes they pay to the government, but also the &mdash; on their federal income tax, it's refundable against the payroll tax.Everyone pays payroll tax. This is their money. This is not our money. And here's what I don't understand &mdash; if you invest that money in a piece of equipment, if you invest that money in a business, you get to write it off your taxes.But if you invest it in your children, in the future of America and strengthening your family, we're not going to recognize that in our tax code? The family is the most important institution in society. And, yes
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~The most important job I'm ever going to have, the most important job anyone in this room will ever have, is the job of being a parent. Not the job of being president, or the job of being a senator, or the job of being a congressman.The most important job any of us will ever do is the job of being a president (sic), because the most important institution in society is the family. If the family breaks down, society breaks down.You can't have a strong nation without strong values, and no one is born with strong values. They have to be taught to you in strong families and reinforced in you in strong communities.And so when we set out to do tax reform, we endeavor to have a pro-family tax code, and we endeavor to do it because we know how difficult it is for families in the 21st century to afford the cost of living.It is expensive to raise children in the 21st century, and families that are raising children are raising the future taxpayers of the United States, and everything costs more. In 35 out of 50 states, child care costs more than college.There are millions of people watching this broadcast tonight that understand exactly what I'm talking about. They don't know how they're going to make that payment every month, and if they can't make it, they can't work, because someone needs to watch their kids during the day. They don't know how they're going to save for their kids' future, to go to college.And so, yes, I have a child tax credit increase, and I'm proud of it. I am proud that I have a pro-family tax code, because the pro- family tax plan I have will strengthen the most important institution in the &mdash; in the country, the family.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~We can't even have an economy if we're not safe. There are radical jihadist in the Middle East beheading people and crucifying Christians. A radical Shia cleric in Iran trying to get a nuclear weapon, the Chinese taking over the South China Sea  [applause]  Yes, I believe the world is a safer &mdash; no, no, I don't believe, I know that the world is a safer place when America is the strongest military power in the world. [cheering and applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, let me begin by answering both the first question and this one, because they're related. As I've said many times before, my parents were never rich people. My father was a bartender. My mother was a maid. They worked for a living. But they were successful people, because, despite the fact that they weren't well educated and had those jobs, they made enough money to buy a home in a safe and stable neighborhood, retire with dignity, leave all four of their children better off than themselves. We call that the American dream, but in fact, it's a universal dream of a better life that people have all over the world. It is a reminder that every country in the world has rich people. What makes America special is that we have millions and millions of people that are not rich, that through hard work and perseverance are able to be successful.The problem is that today people are not successful working as hard as ever because the economy is not providing jobs that pay enough. If I thought that raising the minimum wage was the best way to help people increase their pay, I would be all for it, but it isn't. In the 20th century, it's a disaster.If you raise the minimum wage, you're going to make people more expensive than a machine. And that means all this automation that's replacing jobs and people right now is only going to be accelerated.Here's the best way to raise wages. Make America the best place in the world to start a business or expand an existing business, tax reform and regulatory reform, bring our debt under control, fully utilize our energy resources so we can reinvigorate manufacturing, repeal and replace Obamacare, and make higher education faster and easier to access, especially vocational training. For the life of me, I don't know why we have stigmatized vocational education. Welders make more money than philosophers. We need more welders and less philosophers. [applause]If we do that &mdash; and if we do this &mdash; if we do this, we will be able to increase wages for millions of Americans and we will be able to leave everyone better off without making anyone worse off.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, that's a great question, and let me begin by answering it. [laughter]This election is about the future, about what kind of country this nation is gonna be in the 21st century. This next (ph) election is actually a generational choice. A choice about what kind of nation we will be in the 21st century.For over 2.5 centuries, America's been a special country, the one place on earth where anyone from anywhere can achieve anything, a nation that's been a force for good on this planet.But now, a growing number of Americans feel out of place in their own country. We have a society that stigmatizes those that hold cultural values that are traditional.We have a society where people &mdash; millions of people &mdash; are living paycheck to paycheck. They're working as hard as they ever have, but they're living paycheck to paycheck because the economy has changed underneath their feet.We have young Americans who owe thousands of dollars in student loans for a degree that doesn't lead to a job. For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than starting, and around the world, every day brings news of a new humiliation for America &mdash; many the direct response &mdash; direct consequence of decisions made when Hillary Clinton was the secretary of the &mdash; of state. And so here's the truth: this election is about the future, and the Democratic Party, and the political left has no ideas about the future. All their ideas are the same, tired ideas of the past. More government, more spending. For every issue for America, their answer is a new tax on someone, and a new government program. This nation is going to turn the page, and that's what this election should be about, and, as I said at the first debate  [bell ringing]  If I am our nominee, they will be the party of the past, we will be the party of the 21st century. [cheering]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, you know, that's an excellent question, because what we are going through in this country is not simply an economic downturn. We are living through a massive economic transformation. I mean, this economy is nothing like what it was like five years ago, not to mention 15 or 20 years ago.And it isn't just a different economy. It's changing faster than ever. You know, it took the telephone 75 years to reach 100 million users. It took Candy Crush one year to reach some 100 million users. [laughter]So the world is changing faster than ever, and it is disruptive. Number one, we are in a global competition now, and several of the candidates have said that. There are now dozens of developed economies on this planet that we have to compete with. And we lose that competition because we have the highest business tax rate in the industrialized world, because we have regulations that continue to grow by the billions every single week, because we have a crazy health care law that discourages companies from hiring people, but because we're not fully utilizing our energy resources, that if we did, it would bring back all kinds of growth, especially in manufacturing, and because we have an outdated higher education system.Our higher education system is completely outdated. It is too expensive, too hard to access, and it doesn't teach 21st century skills. If we do what needs to be done &mdash; tax reform, regulatory reform, fully utilize our energy resources, repeal and replace Obamacare, and modernize higher education, then we can grasp the potential and the promise of this new economy. And we won't just save the American dream. We will expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before. And then truly this new century can be a new American century. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~You know, if I may respond
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Absolutely. And I think that we ought to look where income inequality seems to be the worst. It seems to be worst in cities run by Democrats, governors of  [applause]States run by Democrats and countries currently run by Democrats. So the thing is, let's look for root causes.But I would also say &mdash; lay some blame at the &mdash; the feet of the Federal Reserve. I think the Federal Reserve has made this problem worse. By artificially keeping interest rates below the market rate, average ordinary citizens have a tough time earning interest, have a tough time making money. They're actually talking now about negative interest.The money as it's created through quantitative easing or other means tends to start out in the big banks in New York. And because we're now paying interest for them to keep the money there, much of that money has not filtered out into the economy. So what we're finding is there is increasing income disparity and income inequality.We also find that as the Federal Reserve destroys the value of the currency, what you're finding is that, if you're poor, if you make $20,000 a year and you have three or four kids, and you're trying to get by, as your prices rise or as the value of the dollar shrinks, these are the people that are hurt the worst.So really we need to reexamine whether we not &mdash; we want a Federal Reserve that's involved so much in determining interest rates. We also need to look at root causes as to what caused the housing boom and the housing collapse.But the bottom line is, if you want less income inequality, move to a city with a Republican mayor or a state with a Republican governor. [applause]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Before we get a little bit off-kilter here
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Can I finish
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Can I finish my time? Could I finish with my time?
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Gerard, can I comment  [crosstalk]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Hey, Gerard, you know, we might want to point out China is not part of this deal.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~How is it conservative to add a trillion dollars in military expenditures? You can not be a conservative if you're going to keep promoting new programs that you're not going to pay for. [applause]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~How is it conservative?
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~I'd like first to respond to the acquisition, we should &mdash; I think it's particularly naive, particularly foolish to think that we're not going to talk to Russia. The idea of a no fly zone, realize that this is also something that Hillary Clinton agrees with several on our side with, you're asking for a no fly zone in an area in which Russia already flies.Russia flies in that zone at the invitation of Iraq. I'm not saying it's a good thing, but you better know at least what we're getting into. So, when you think it's going to be a good idea to have a no fly zone over Iraq, realize that means you are saying we are going to shoot down Russian planes. If you're ready for that, be ready to send your sons and daughters to another war in Iraq. I don't want to see that happen. I think the first war in Iraq was a mistake  [cheering and applause] You can be strong without being involved in every civil war around the war
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Neil, there's a point I'd like to make here  [applause]  .Neil, a point that I'd like to make about the tax credits. We have to decide what is conservative and what isn't conservative. Is it fiscally conservative to have a trillion-dollar expenditure? We're not talking about giving people back their tax money. He's talking about giving people money they didn't pay. It's a welfare transfer payment.So here's what we have. Is it conservative to have $1 trillion in transfer payments &mdash; a new welfare program that's a refundable tax credit? Add that to Marco's plan for $1 trillion in new military spending, and you get something that looks, to me, not very conservative. Thank you. [applause][crosstalk]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Nevertheless, it's not very conservative, Marco.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~No. I don't think we're any safer &mdash; I do not think we are any safer from bankruptcy court. As we go further, and further into debt, we become less, and less safe. This is the most important thing we're going to talk about tonight. Can you be a conservative, and be liberal on military spending? Can you be for unlimited military spending, and say, Oh, I'm going to make the country safe? No, we need a safe country, but, you know, we spend more on our military than the next ten countries combined?I want a strong national defense, but I don't want us to be bankrupt. [bell ringing][crosstalk]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Ours is 14.5 percent for corporations, 14.5 percent for individuals. No payroll tax for the employee. The business tax pays for social security, and there would be two remaining deductions &mdash; home mortgage and charity.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Ronald Reagan was strong, but Ronald Reagan didn't
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~send troops into the Middle East
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Thank you. [applause]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~The first thing I would do as president is repeal the regulations that are hampering our energy that the President has put in place. [applause] Including the Clean Power Act. While I do think that man may have a role in our climate, I think nature also has a role. The planet's 4.5 billion years old, we've been through geologic age after geologic age. We've had times when the temperatures been warmer, we've had times when the temperatures been colder. We've had times when the carbon in the atmosphere's been higher. So, I think before we &mdash; we need to look before we leap. President's often fond of saying he wants a balance solution, but, really we do need to balance both keeping the environment clean, and we will have some rules for that. We got to balance that with the economy.He's devastated my state. I say the President's not only destroying Kentucky, he's destroying the democrat party down there because nobody wants to associate with him. So, what we really need is somebody that understands that we do need energy of all forms, and that means we will have solar, and wind, and hydro, but we will still have coal, and we still will have natural gas. And, we've got to have an all of the above policy.But, it would be a mistake to shut down all of our industries in the coal fields, and shut down the coal power plants. If we did so we're going to have a day where we wake up and some of our big cities are either very cold, or very hot. So, I think it's a big danger, and we shouldn't do it. And, what we should do is say we want all of the above  [bell ringing]  We want to free up the energy sector, and let people produce, let them drill, let them explore.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~The first thing I would do is I wouldn't arm our enemies. I wouldn't arm ISIS. [cheering and applause]Most of the people who want to the no-fly zone also favored arming the allies of al Qaeda, which became ISIS. That was the dumbest, most foolhardy notion. And most of the people up here supported it. They wanted to arm the allies of al Qaeda. Some of them still do.That's how ISIS grew. We pushed back Assad, and ISIS was allowed to grow in the vacuum. So the first thing you do is don't arm your enemies.  [crosstalk]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~There is an argument that China doesn't like the deal, because in us doing the deal, we'll be trading with their competitors. You're exactly right. But I think we've sort of missed the point a little bit here. There is an important point, though, about how we discuss these trade treaties that I do agree with Mr. Trump on. We should negotiate from a position of strength. And we also should negotiate using the full force and the constitutional power that was given to us. I think it's a mistake that we give up power to the presidency on these trade deals. We give up the power to filibuster, and I'm kind of fond of that power. [laughter]We give up the power to amend. And I think, really, one of the big problems we have in our country is, over the last century, really, so much power has gravitated to the executive branch. Really, Congress is kind of a bystander. We don't write the rules. We don't make the laws. The executive branch does. So even in trade &mdash; and I am for trade &mdash; I think we should be careful about giving so much power to the presidency. [applause]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~This is an important question. This is an incredibly important question. And the question goes to be, who do we want to be our commander-in-chief? Do you want a commander-in-chief who says something that we never did throughout the entire Cold War, to discontinue having conversations with the Russians?I am not happy about them flying over there. But I'm not naive enough to say, well, Iraq has them flying over their airspace, we're just going to announce that we're shooting them down?That is naive to the point of being something you might hear in junior high. But it's scary [crosstalk]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~We're the richest, freest, most humanitarian nation in the history of mankind. But we also borrow a million dollars a minute. And the question I have for all Americans is, think about it, can you be a fiscal conservative if you don't conserve all of the money? If you're a profligate spender, you spend money in an unlimited fashion for the military, is that a conservative notion? We have to be conservative with all spending, domestic spending and welfare spending. I'm the only fiscal conservative on the stage. [applause]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, it's a great question, Neil, and thanks for including me in the tax debate. I think what's important about the tax debate is, is that we have to ask the question, where is money best spent, in the private sector or in the government sector? I want a government really, really small, so small you can barely see it. So I want lower taxes and much more money in the private sector. [cheering and applause]My tax plan, however, is the only tax plan among any of the candidates on the stage that is part of a balanced budget plan. I put forward three plans that actually balance the budget over a five-year period.Each of these plans have details on exactly where we would cut. The question came up earlier, where would you cut? Nobody likes to say where they would cut. I've put pencil to paper and done three budgets that actually balance.I'm also in favor of a plan called the penny plan where we'd just cut 1 percent across the board and the budget actually balances in less than five years. So I think what is extraordinary about my tax plan is it is in the context of balancing the budget. What is also extraordinary about my tax plan is it gets rid of the payroll tax. Democrats demagogue this issue to death, and when they do they say, oh, a millionaire would get a bigger tax cut than someone making $10,000. That's proportionality, as Ben is trying to explain to folks. But the thing is, is if we get rid of the payroll tax, everybody is going to get a tax cut. And this is something that I think the public at large will support and could win an election. [applause]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Yeah, but, Marco! Marco! How is it conservative, how is it conservative to add a trillion-dollar expenditure for the federal government that you're not paying for?
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Yes, I would like to finish my response, basically.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Absolutely yes. You know, I have spent much of my adult life enforcing the law and defending the Constitution. And the problem that underlies all of this is the cronyism and corruption of Washington.You know, the opening question Jerry asked, would you bail out the big banks again? Nobody gave you an answer to that. I'll give you an answer. Absolutely not. [applause]And what we have right now is we have Washington &mdash; as government gets bigger and bigger, you know, the biggest lie in all of Washington and in all of politics is that Republicans are the party of the rich. The truth is, the rich do great with big government. They get in bed with big government. The big banks get bigger and bigger and bigger under Dodd-Frank and community banks are going out of business. And, by the way, the consequence of that is small businesses can't get business loans, and it is that fundamental corruption that is why six of the 10 wealthiest counties in America are in and around Washington, D.C.And let me give you a contrast to Washington cronyism. Some weeks ago, a woman named Sabina Loving testified at a hearing that I chaired in the Senate. Sabina Loving is an African-American single mom who started a tax preparation business in the south side of Chicago. She found a store front, she wanted to have her own business. She started a business.But then the IRS promulgated new regulations targeting tax preparers. They did it under a more than 100-year-old statute called the Dead Horse Act. Now, this statute and the IRS in classic Washington crony fashion had exemptions for lawyers and big fancy accountants, but Sabina had to pay $1,000 an employee. It would have driven her out of business, and Ms. Loving sued the IRS. She took the Obama IRS to court, and she won, and they struck down the rule for picking the big guys over the little guys.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~And, Maria, I will note, she's got a lot of experience, but her policies have proven disastrous. If you look at foreign policy, every region in the world has gotten worse. Under her leadership, we abandon the nation of Israel. Under her leadership, radical Islamic terrorism has been on to the rise. Under her leadership, and Obama's leadership, Iran is getting $100 billion dollars, and on the verge of getting a nuclear weapon.Everything she's put her hand to, or has touched &mdash; and when we talk about the cronyism of Washington, Hillary Clinton embodies the cronyism  [bell ringing]  of Washington. And, I'll give you an example of that, which is the Congressional exemption from Obamacare, which is fundamentally wrong, and I'll tell you this, if I'm elected president, I will veto any statute that exempts members of congress. The law should apply evenly to every American. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~but what would you do if the bank was failing?
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~But you just said an executive
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Exactly right, that we have to defend this nation. You think defending this nation is expensive, try not defending it. That's a lot more expensive. [applause and cheering] But, you can do that, and pay for it. You can do that, and also be fiscally responsible. You know, I mention that the 25 programs that I put today, that I would eliminate them. Among them are corporate welfare, like sugar subsidies. Let's take that as an example. Sugar subsidies. Sugar farmers farm under  [bell ringing]  under roughly 0.2% of the farmland in America, and yet they give 40% of the lobbying money. That sort of corporate welfare is why we're bankrupting our kids, and grandkids. I would end those subsidies to pay for defending this nation
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Fifty-eight years ago, my father fled Cuba. As he stood on the deck of that ferryboat with the wind and salt air blowing, he looked back at the oppression and torture he was escaping. And yet he looked forward to the promise of America. His story is our story. What ties Americans together is we are all the children of those who risked everything for freedom.America is in crisis now. I believe in America. And if we get back to the free market principles and constitutional liberties that built this country, we can turn this country around. I believe that 2016 will be an election like 1980, that we will win by following Reagan's admonition to paint in bold colors, not pale pastels. We're building a grassroots army. I ask you to join us at tedcruz.org. And we, the people, can turn this nation around. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~I want to go back to the discussion we had a minute ago because, you know, what was said was right. The democrats are laughing &mdash; because if republicans join democrats as the party of amnesty, we will lose. [applause]And, you know, I understand that when the mainstream media covers immigration, it doesn't often see it as an economic issue. But, I can tell you for millions &mdash; of Americans at home watching this, it is a very personal economic issue. And, I will say the politics of it will be very, very different if a bunch of lawyers or bankers were crossing the Rio Grande.[audience reaction]Or if a bunch of people with journalism degrees were coming over and driving down the wages in the press. [audience reaction] [applause and cheering] Then, we would see stories about the economic calamity that is befalling our nation. And, I will say for those of us who believe people 'ought to come to this country legally, and we should enforce the law, we're tired of being told it's anti-immigrant. It's offensive. [applause]I am the son of an immigrant who came legally from Cuba  [bell ringing] to seek the American dream. And, we can embrace legal immigration while believing in the rule of law &mdash; and I would note, try going illegally to another country. Try going to China, or Japan. Try going to Mexico. See what they do. Every sovereign nation secures its borders, and it is not compassionate to say we're not going to enforce the laws  [bell ringing] And we're going to drive down the wages for millions of hardworking men and women. That is abandoning the working  [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~knows to step in and bail out a bank.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Maria, critically, when it comes to climate change
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Middle ground that brings both of these together
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Our &mdash; our
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~So let me be clear. I would not bail them out, but instead of adjusting monetary policy according to whims and getting it wrong over and over again and causing booms and busts, what the Fed should be doing is, number one, keeping our money tied to a stable level of gold, and, number two, serving as a lender of last resort.That's what central banks do. So if you have a run on the bank, the Fed can serve as a lender of last resort, but it's not a bailout. It is a loan at higher interest rates. That's how central banks have worked.And I'll point out &mdash; look, we had a gold standard under Bretton Woods, we had it for about 170 years of our nation's history, and enjoyed booming economic growth and lower inflation than we have had with the Fed now.We need to get back to sound money, which helps, in particular, working men and women. What Washington does &mdash; the people who are doing well in the Obama economy are those with power and influence in the Obama government. The people who [inaudible] working men and women [crosstalk]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~So you &mdash; you would bail them out.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~So you said you'd abandon philosophy and abandon principle
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~So, Governor Kasich
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, Maria, it's great to be with you. It's great to be here in Milwaukee. You know, the question you asked really I think is the most important question any of us can have &mdash; face, which is, how do we get the economy growing? How do we bring back economic growth?Because economic growth, it's foundational to every other challenge we have. As you rightly noted, from 2008 to today, our economy has grown 1.2 percent a year on average. The Obama economy is a disaster, and the IMF is telling us this is a new normal. It doesn't have to be.If you look at the history of America, there are three levers that government has had to facilitate economic growth. The first is tax reform. And as you noted, I have rolled out a bold and simple flat tax: 10 percent for every American that would produce booming growth and 4.9 million new jobs within a decade.The second element is regulatory reform, pulling back the armies of regulators that have descended like locusts on small businesses.And the third element is sound money. Every time we've pursued all three of those &mdash; whether in the 1920s with Calvin Coolidge or the 1960s with JFK or the 1980s with Ronald Reagan &mdash; the result has been incredible economic growth. We have done it before, and with leadership, we can do it again. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, my Mom is here, so I don't think we should be pushing any grannies off cliffs. [laughter] And, you miss-stated what I've said on entitlement reform. What I've said is for seniors we should make no changes whatsoever, for younger workers we should gradually raise the retirement age, we should have benefits grow more slowly, and we should allow them to keep a portion of their taxes in a personal account that they control, and can pass on to their kids  [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, sure, you put your finger on what the problem is. The current system isn't fair. Washington is fundamentally corrupt. There are more words in the IRS code than there are in the Bible &mdash; and &mdash; and not a one of them is as good. [laughter]Every one of them reflects a carve-out or a subsidy, and it's all about empowering the Washington cartel. My simple Flat Tax says that, for a family of four, for the first $36,000 you earn, you pay no taxes whatsoever. No income taxes, no payroll taxes, no nothing.Above that, every American pays 10 percent across the board &mdash; a flat, fair tax. Which means that no longer do you have hedge-fund billionaires paying a lower tax rate than their secretaries.On the business side, I've got a business flat tax of 16 percent &mdash; again, that applies across the board. Right now, with our corporate income tax, giant corporations with armies of accountants regularly are paying little to no taxes while small businesses are getting hammered.This is fair and across-the-board. Now, you ask, how do the numbers add up? I would encourage folks, if you go to our website, tedcruz.org, we have the specific numbers on the website.This plan eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax, eliminates the corporate income tax, and it abolishes the IRS. [applause]And the effect of that is incredible economic growth. It means every income group will see double-digit increases, from the very poorest to the very weakest, of at least 14 percent.So if you're a single mom, if you're making $40,000 a year, what that means is an extra about $5,000 in your pocket to provide for your kids, to make ends meet. It has a powerful, powerful effect.And there's one other really powerful feature of my plan, which is that it's border-adjustable. Which means, if you're an exporter &mdash; if you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you're a manufacturer, you don't pay the businesses flat tax.Exports are free of that tax, but all imports pay that 16 percent business flat tax, which means this tax plan would cause jobs to boom, and it would let America compete with China and the world on a level playing field. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Well, the numbers the Tax Foundation had put out is that the static cost of the plan is $3.6 trillion over 10 years, but the dynamic cost of the plan, which &mdash; which is the cost that factors in growth, is about $768 billion.It is less than a trillion. It costs less than virtually every other plan people have put up here, and yet it produces more growth and it's one of the very few plans that abolishes the IRS.But on top of that, today, we rolled out a spending plan. $500 billion in specific cuts &mdash; five major agencies that I would eliminate. The IRS, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Energy, the Department of Commerce, and HUD &mdash; and then 25 specific programs.Again, that's on our website at tedcruz.org. You want to look at specificity? It's easy for everyone to say, "cut spending". It's much harder and riskier to put out, chapter and verse, specifically the programs you would cut to stop bankrupting our kids and grandkids.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~why would you then bail out rich Wall Street banks, but not Main street, not Mom and Pop, not Sabina Loving?
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin~November 10, 2015~Yes. Now, let's be clear, there is a role for the Federal Reserve &mdash; what the Fed is doing now is it is a series of philosopher- kings trying to guess what's happening with the economy. You look at the Fed, one of the reasons we had the financial crash is throughout the 2000s, we had loose money, we had an asset bubble, it drove up the price of real estate, drove up the price of commodities, and then in the third quarter of 2008, the Fed tightened the money and crashed those asset prices, which caused a cascading collapse. That's why I am supporting getting back to rules-based monetary system not with a bunch of philosopher-kings deciding, but tied [crosstalk]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Can I just add one very quick thing? And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan. And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best. Just want to get that out there, just saying.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Neil, I was mentioned too.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~OK.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem. But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics. And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that. And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place. They have infrastructure. All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November. Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on. I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came. [laughter]You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations. The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before. Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid. And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously. And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.I mean, just think about a scenario like that. They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse. They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs. Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point? He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.But here's the real key. We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it. And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed. A flat tax for everybody &mdash; no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money. You know, I &mdash; my &mdash; my mother taught me this. You know, she only had a third-grade education, but &mdash; you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car. In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation. But [laughter]  you know, the &mdash; the &mdash; the fact of the matter is &mdash; you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations &mdash; because every regulation is a tax, it's a &mdash; on goods and services. And it's the most regressive tax there is.You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up &mdash; you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that. A rich person does not. Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our &mdash; our &mdash; our people like this. And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.It's not the evil rich people. It's the evil government that is &mdash; that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing. Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need. I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done. In addition to that [applause] in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue. You know, some of these &mdash; these engagement rules that the administration has &mdash; "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" &mdash; give me a break.Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them. So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed. You know, that's so simple. [applause]And then we need to shut down &mdash; we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers. Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?We know to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go. They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means. But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore? Do we still have standards? Do we still have values and principles?You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society. You know, we have a war on virtual everything &mdash; race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars. Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section &mdash; you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names. Where did that spirit come from in America? It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that. And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong. And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great. They've been beaten into submission. It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Yeah, he said everybody. [laughter]And &mdash; and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we &mdash; and when I say we, Republicans &mdash; tore themselves apart.You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it. And we got to look at the big picture here.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics. The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people. And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity. Bencarson.com &mdash; we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~And the last piece is this. I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed. That was before he was running against me. Now that he is, he's changed his tune.I'm never going to change my tune. I like Marco Rubio. He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office. It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too. [laughter]So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then. So let's set the facts straight. First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor. Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban. I have vetoed a reduction this clip size. I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey. So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator. See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk. And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do. And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements. Do you remember that, everybody? This was a question on entitlements. And the reason &mdash; and the reason [crosstalk] no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it. Here's the thing. [crosstalk] The fact is, the reason why
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week &mdash; the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore. They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.I love this country. It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known. We need someone to fight for the people. We need a fighter for this country again.I've lived my whole life fighting &mdash; fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot. You think about it &mdash; this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state &mdash; drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing. In fact, he's done worse than nothing.This president &mdash; and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer &mdash; she called Assad a reformer. Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad. The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace &mdash; we are not going to have peace in Syria. We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore. The Syrians should stay in Syria. They shouldn't be going to Europe. And here's the last piece [applause] you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge. You're simply not. And so Senator Graham is right about this. And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.And believe me, Assad is not worth it. And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.Hillary Clinton cannot be president. It will lead to even greater war in this world. And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.That makes the world less peaceful, less safe. In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~MIlitary action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world. We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either. We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships. It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~No, absolutely not. The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people. And the fact is that that's not a democracy. That's a dictatorship. And we need to very, very concerned about that.See, here's the thing. I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident. I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat. I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important. The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit. We have made it easier to do that, not harder. And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not by signing unconstitutional executive orders. This guy is a petulant child. That's what he is. I mean, you know [applause]  the fact is, Neil, let's think about &mdash; let's think about &mdash; and I want to maybe &mdash; I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.Mr. President, we're not against you. We're against your policies. When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate. You had only 21 Republican governors in this country. And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it. That's not right. It's not constitutional. And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Now Maria, listen. I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind. And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe. That's the end of the conversation.I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue. Here's the way you need to deal with it. You can't just ban all Muslims. You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists. You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.[bell rings]And this summer, we didn't do that. We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president. Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~the fact is &mdash; the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard. It's a hard problem. And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this &mdash; avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes. Bernie Sanders has already said it. And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress &mdash; this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund. A Republican Congress did that.And the fact is it was wrong. And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security. We need to reform Social Security. Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey. He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan. He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country." Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president. Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to &mdash; remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time. This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey. I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country. That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws. And this president turns his back &mdash; this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal. This president allows lawlessness throughout this country. Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General. I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively. Make our streets safe again. Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well. I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria. Here's &mdash; here's our plan. We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world &mdash; and we double tax, as you know.And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax. And who can blame them? They pay tax once overseas. They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given &mdash; bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.Bring the money &mdash; the $2 trillion &mdash; back to the United States. We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money. And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.It would not necessitate us raising any taxes. It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about. And &mdash; and &mdash; and the last piece of this, Maria, is this. You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America. He's penalized &mdash; and doesn't understand. In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration. That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country. We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.And remember this &mdash; I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history. We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world. Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama. And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know? [applause]The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess. The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world. And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word. Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood. And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it. Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience. And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right. It's a &mdash; it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.The president doesn't understand &mdash; and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton &mdash; and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight. If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.I will not do that. If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~[inaudible]. Big difference.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK? Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb &mdash; I tell you what, we don't need that.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Because now he's going a little bit better. No, I didn't care [inaudible]. It's true. No, it's true. Hey look, he never had a chance. Now, he's doing better. He's got probably a four or five percent chance. [laughter][crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~But I was born here.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Can I tell you what? It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up. They're never going to let it happen.Japan, the same thing. They are devaluing &mdash; it's so impossible for &mdash; you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu. Kamatsu is a tractor company in Japan. Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor. And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.And that's why we have to use Carl and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Carl said, "no, no &mdash; " but he's somebody &mdash; these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this. If these are the kinds of people &mdash; we should use our best and our finest.Now, on that tariff &mdash; here's what I'm saying, China &mdash; they send their goods and we don't tax it &mdash; they do whatever they want to do. They do whatever what they do, OK. When we do business with China, they tax us. You don't know it, they tax us.I have many friends that deal with China. They can't &mdash; when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed. If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal &mdash; so we don't have an equal playing field. I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.I'm a free trader. I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate. I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine. I sell tens' of millions of [inaudible].I love China. I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Eleven points, to be exact.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~first of all, let me just tell you something &mdash; and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself &mdash; NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll &mdash; headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down. I mean, so don't &mdash; so you can't &mdash; you can't [booing] they don't like the Wall Street Journal. They don't like NBC, but I like the poll. [laughter]And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you. So &mdash; you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls. [applause]You don't have to say that. In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one. Number two, this isn't me saying it. I don't care. I think I'm going to win fair and square [inaudible] to win this way. Thank you. Lawrence Tribe and [inaudible] from Harvard &mdash; of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this. OK? There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office. Here's the problem. We're running. We're running. He does great. I win. I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride. I don't like that. OK? [laughter]The fact is &mdash; and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field [inaudible]. See, they don't like that. They don't like that. [audience booing] No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me. [laughter]But &mdash; if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit. You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running. And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office? So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide. And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much [crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~He's wrong. He's wrong.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~He is not the only one.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~I'll check for you.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~I'm happy to have him tonight [laughter]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~I'm totally open to a tariff. If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed. You can't deal in China without tariffs. They do it to us, we don't it. It's not fair trade.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.[crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers. They're tough, they're strong, they're great people. Half of them had tears pouring down their face. They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads. It was a terrible sight. A terrible sight. And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion. If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.We will make America great again. We will win on everything we do. Thank you. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~I want security for this country. OK? [applause]I want security. I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot. I want security for this country. We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam. We have a tremendous problem. It's not only a problem here. It's a problem all over the world.I want to find out why those two young people &mdash; those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them &mdash; people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them. I want to find out &mdash; many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment. Why weren't they vigilant? Why didn't they call? Why didn't they call the police?And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country. I will tell you that. [applause]The most mistreated people. In fact, we need to &mdash; wait a minute &mdash; we need vigilance. We have to find out &mdash; many people knew about what was going on. Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?There's something going on and it's bad. And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it. That's all I'm saying. We need security.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~I would put it in a blind trust. Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it. If that's a blind trust, I don't know. But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~It's not fear and terror, it's reality. You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over. [applause]You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a &mdash; the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow. They're very, very badly wounded. They will &mdash; some will follow. And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor &mdash; very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.That could be the great Trojan Horse. It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction. When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women? It looked like very few women. Very few children. Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on? You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized &mdash; they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 &mdash; going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look &mdash; a good strong look and that's what we have. We are nineteen trillion dollars &mdash; our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders. We can't do it. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~It's not that complicated actually.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Maria &mdash; Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion. It's one of the biggest problems our country has. Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs &mdash; leave them behind. They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in. But they can't get along. They can't even make a deal. Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal. We have to do something. Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have. So many companies are going to leave our country.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Neil, the problem
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~No &mdash; no [laughter]  I think if it doesn't  [applause] I like that. I like it. I'd consider it. But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~No, I said, " I would use &mdash; " they were asking me what to do about North Korea. China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control &mdash; just about, of North Korea. They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.They say, " well, we don't really have control." Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat. China is ripping us on trade. They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies. Thousands of thousands &mdash; you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost &mdash; 50,000 because of China.[crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~No, the new planes. I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~No. [laughter] No. [applause]Look, we have to stop with political correctness. We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the &mdash; with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world. I just left Indonesia &mdash; bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb. We have to find out what's going on. I said temporarily. I didn't say permanently. I said temporarily. And I have many great Muslim friends. And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason. And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem. My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."But we have a serious problem. And we can't be the stupid country any more. We're laughed at all over the world. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~No. I am a 2nd amendment person. If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead. So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.We have a huge mental health problem in this country. We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money. We have to get back into looking at what's causing it. The guns don't pull the trigger. It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on. [applause] We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order. He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress. You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation. He just writes out an executive order. Not supposed to happen that way. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~OK, good. Because it wouldn't work.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~OK, just so you understand &mdash; I know so much about trading about with China. Carl Icahn today as you know endorsed. Many businessmen want to endorse me.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Okay. First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers. Actually a close friend. And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend. We're friends. That's good. [laughter] But she did say there was anger. And I could say, oh, I'm not angry. I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger. Our military is a disaster. [applause] Our healthcare is a horror show. Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it. We have no borders. Our vets are being treated horribly. Illegal immigration is beyond belief. Our country is being run by incompetent people. And yes, I am angry. [applause] And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry. And I say that to Nikki. So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended. She said the truth. One of your colleagues interviewed me. And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right. I'm not fighting that. I didn't find it offensive at all. I'm angry because our country is a mess. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand. [applause]And just so &mdash; if I could, because he insulted a lot of people. I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made &mdash; New York is a great place. It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people. When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York. You had two one hundred [applause]  you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down. I saw them come down. Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction. I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it. And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death &mdash; nobody understood it. And it was with us for months, the smell, the air. And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers. And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Thank you.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~That's wrong. They were wrong. It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~The fact is, there is a big overhang. There's a big question mark on your head. And you can't do that to the party. You really can't. You can't do that to the party. You have to have certainty. Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because [inaudible].I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run. If there was a &mdash; and you know I'm not bringing a suit. I promise. But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty. You can't have a question. I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~There are many lawyers.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~They were wrong.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~We've lost anywhere between four and seven million jobs because of China. What I said then was, "we have very unfair trade with China. We're going to have a trade deficit of 505 billion dollars this year with China." A lot of that is because they devalue their currency.What I said to the New York Times, is that, "we have great power, economic power over China and if we wanted to use that and the amount &mdash; where the 45 percent comes in, that would be the amount they saw their devaluations that we should get." That we should get.What I'm saying is this, I'm saying that we do it but if they don't start treating us fairly and stop devaluing and let their currency rise so that our companies can compete and we don't lose all of these millions of jobs that we're losing, I would certainly start taxing goods that come in from China. Who the hell has to lose 505 billion dollars a year?
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~We don't need that. That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that. And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now. And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look. They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China. They don't want them made here. They want those planes made in China.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company. As you too know, I know I built a very great company. But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company. It's peanuts.I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again. I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there. Run the company kids, have a good time. I'm going to do it for America.So I would &mdash; I would be willing to do that.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long. It would just &mdash; you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money. We just can't do it any longer.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~You don't have to. Take it from Lawrence Tribe. [applause] [crosstalk] Take it from your professors [crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~You get the Congress. You get the Senate. You get together. You do legislation. He just writes out an order, executive order. It's not supposed to happen that way. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~You looking at me?
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Absolutely.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Check it out. [laughter]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Donald, Donald &mdash; can I &mdash; I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS. The Kurds are our strongest allies. They're Muslim. You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?The other Arab countries have a role to play in this. We cannot be the world's policeman. We can't do this unilaterally. We have to do this in unison with the Arab world. And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria. [applause]So I hope you'll reconsider. I hope you'll reconsider. The better way of dealing with this &mdash; the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the &mdash; Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder &mdash; make the screening take place.We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously? What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the &mdash; [applause] &mdash; the Emanuel AME church killings. And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed. [applause] I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place. Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake. The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do. We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job. Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not &mdash; would not have passed a background check. The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is. It isn't law-abiding gun owners.Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away. You're going away for a long, long while.And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities. Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide. The other issue is mental health. That's a serious issue that we could work on. Republicans and Democrats alike believe this. [applause] The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have. Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Here's &mdash; apart from the &mdash; apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~I got that. And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C. There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies. They understand that there's a national security risk. We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.We need to make sure that we keep the country safe. This is the first priority. The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely. Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is &mdash; that is just shameful. 23 million files in the hands of the Chinese? So it's not just the government &mdash; the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well. That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators &mdash; back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country. We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff &mdash;
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~My name was mentioned. My name was mentioned here. The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China. You can &mdash; if you &mdash; you flew in with your 767, didn't you? Right there, right next to the plant.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Neil, my name was mentioned here. Neil, my name was mentioned as well.Here's the deal, Chris is totally right. He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton. And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be &mdash; this is not being bad.These attack ads are going to be part of life. Everybody just needs to get used to it. Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster. [applause]Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the &mdash; the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~No, not at all, absolutely not. I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically. I totally get that. But we're running for the presidency of the United States here. This isn't &mdash; this isn't, you know, a different kind of job. You have to lead. You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength. And so it was [inaudible] his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~No. And worse &mdash; worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.Think about it. She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have &mdash; that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess. And that is wrong.And you know what? Here's the problem. If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now. If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse. We need to stop that. [laughter and applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Oh, I'll talk about that, too. But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind. [laughter]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes &mdash; the equivalent of it goes to China. Or how about Boeing right here within a mile? Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus? Of course, they would. This would be devastating for the economy. We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies &mdash; that we need to build better relationships with? Of course not. What we need to do is destroy ISIS.I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there. We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria. We need to embed with &mdash; with the Iraqi military. We need to arm the Kurds the directly. We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.We need the lawyers off the back of the war fighters. That's how you solve the problem. You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~There's &mdash; look, there's &mdash;
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~They're a mile away from here.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe. The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.Think about it. With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists. He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient. [applause]I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military. In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force. Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult &mdash; we're in a much different position than we should be.And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well. Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military. We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military. Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again. It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.The deployments are too high for the military personnel. We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment. The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman. The planes are older than the pilots. We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board. We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles. Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel [applause] and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority. We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations. The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak. This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran. We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, if the law would change, yeah. But I think there has to be recognition that if we &mdash; if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other &mdash; other technology companies outside the United States. And what we want to do is to control this.We also want to dominate this from a commercial side. So there's a lot of balanced interests. But the president leads in this regard. That's what we need. We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer? Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.Credibility counts. There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do. I've done it. I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Yeah, they are unhinged.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Yeah.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~You've got to keep asking. You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue. If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship &mdash;
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~For too long &mdash; no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us. And guess what? The worker's out of a job.So when they &mdash; be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker? Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade. And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need &mdash; we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.And I want to just suggest to you. How do I know this? Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar. And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load. So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country. That's what I think we need to do. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~I &mdash; I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees. And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them. But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category. And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago. If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states. We need Jordan. We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.[bell rings]It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again. And if we try to put everybody in the same &mdash; call everybody the same thing, we can't do it. And that's just not acceptable.But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs. And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt. And our economy was growing like crazy. It's the same thing that I did in Ohio. It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety. It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way. And if you tax cuts &mdash; if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the &mdash; in the world.But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline. We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget. And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.Right now, you don't have the &mdash; you have taxes that are too high. You have regulations &mdash; I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses. They are &mdash; they're in a position where they're smothering people. And I mean, are you kidding me? We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise. You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy. And how do I know it? Because I've done it. I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici. And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.Our wages are growing faster than the national average. We're running surpluses. And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Neil, Neil &mdash; can I say one thing about this. I'm a free trader. I support NAFTA. I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China. And we do need China &mdash; Donald's right about North Korea.I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials. But what he's touching &mdash; talking about, I think has got merit. And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat. She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety. And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police. And they came back with 23 recommendations. One of them is a statewide use of deadly force. And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio. Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for &mdash; for training. But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police. Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not &mdash; not to lose their life. Their family is waiting for them.At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions. But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong. And it has been a remarkable situation in our state. And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks. It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have. Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed. I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone. You've got to bring people together. You've got to give people hope.And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America. And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee. That's not even an issue. But look [applause] and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States. So here's this &mdash; the situation, I think, Maria.And this is what we have to &mdash; I &mdash; I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise &mdash; and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years &mdash; it's very, very difficult for them.Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need. Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in &mdash; in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.People are upset about it. I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn. Do we have answer for that? We do. There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.I'll tell you what else people are concerned about. Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job. We got to do a lot about the high cost of high &mdash; higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay. [applause]Let me tell you that, in this country &mdash; in this country, people are concerned about their economic future. They're very concerned about it. And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to &mdash; keeping them from getting it.That's not the America that I've ever known. My father used to say, "Johnny, we never &mdash; we don't hate the rich. We just want to be the rich." And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America &mdash; and I mean everybody in America &mdash; having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.I'm president &mdash; look, I've done it once. I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes. The economy was really booming.And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the &mdash; than the national average. A growth of 385,000 jobs.[bell rings]It's not that hard. Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts. Get it done, because our &mdash; our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done. And, folks, we will. You count on it.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, let me &mdash; let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience. I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina. Let em also tell you [applause] that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense. And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems. So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved. With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country. And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses. That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way. And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them. [applause] So look, in foreign policy &mdash; in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool. You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go. And I'm going to tell you, that it &mdash; I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training. I've seen so much of it  a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War. You see what the Saudi's &mdash; deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us. And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.Thank you.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power. You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.But all of my career, you know, having been raised in &mdash; by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English. You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home. Look, that's who I stand up for. That's who's in my mind [bell rings] And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future. Thank you. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns. He has never defended [crosstalk] I'll give you a fact. Well, let me tell you this. Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion." That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this. This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment. [applause]He doesn't meet &mdash; here's the difference. When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans." It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns." That will never happen when I am president of the United States. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~But on this point, if I may add something on this point. We are all frustrated with what China is doing. I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff. If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.It begins with tax reform. Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world. Let's allow companies to immediately expense. [applause]It continues with regulatory reform. Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.How about Obamacare, a certified job killer? It needs to be repealed and replaced. And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger. That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~But that's not an accurate description of the plan. Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax. Someone's going to be collecting this tax.In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found? That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax. Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make. They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.So there are people watching tonight in business. If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from? You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill. And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold. You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government. Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at. But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid [bell rings] and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent. Now, you've got Europe. [crosstalk]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~If you'll answer the [inaudible] core question.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Let me [inaudible]. I was invoked in that question, so let me just say &mdash; in that answer &mdash; let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV. [laughter]But the real &mdash; but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about. OK? Listen, we &mdash; this is the greatest country in the history of mankind. But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America. He wants to change America. We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution. He undermines it. We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage. We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.This election has to be about reversing all of that damage. That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders. When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military. And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world. When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Maria, let me clear something up here. This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration. Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it. You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it. You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it. You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it. And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it. I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason. [applause]That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation. When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant. Edward Snowden is a traitor. And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason. [applause]And one more point, one more point. Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it. Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this. If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~No, it's your record.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Our next president
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away. [applause]Look, the Second Amendment is not an option. It is not a suggestion. It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families. I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would. I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would. I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.Here's my second problem. None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive. You know why? Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show. They don't buy their guns from a collector. And they don't buy their guns from a gun store. They get &mdash; they steal them. They get them on the black market.And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show. These [laughter and applause]  his answer &mdash; you name it. If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control. Here's a fact. We are in a war against ISIS. They are trying to attack us here in America. They attacked us in Philadelphia last week. They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago. And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago. Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally. They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS. Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees. We know this for a fact. They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border. And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood. Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes. [applause] Here is the one thing I'm not going to do. I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan. It's called the value added tax. And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe. Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said. Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.Now, you can support one now that's very low. But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors. Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job. And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue. Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck. They are much more than that. This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region. This is not some small scale group.They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world. So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president. If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years. And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job. This issue is not about that anymore.First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe. And here's why. There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system. And not just green cards. They're looking &mdash; they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances. They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.They're looking &mdash; they're looking to manipulate our &mdash; the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States. So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States. So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil. He is &mdash; this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government. This president is undermining our military. He is undermining our standing in the world. I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core. [applause] We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control. This president, this president is more interested in funding &mdash; less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned &mdash; he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military. Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood. All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country. It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary. Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America. We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage. No one is a socialist. No one here is under FBI investigation. So we have a good group of people.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton. She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States. [applause]Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States. Ever. [applause]On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power. Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size. And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS. He consistently underestimates it but I do not. There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS. The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them. And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government. Our rights come from God.That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world. That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel. This country is changing. It feels different. We feel like we're being left behind and left out.And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America. We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military. And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history. If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.But if we elect the right person &mdash; if you elect me &mdash; we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country. [applause] We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~"13 Hours" &mdash; tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them. I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter. This will end. It will end on January 2017.And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~&mdash; at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false. They're absolutely false.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.[crosstalk]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.[crosstalk]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~And I'll tell you what, Donald, you &mdash; you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P. slot. [laughter] I'll tell you what. If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P. So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Because &mdash; because Donald's mother was born in Scotland. She was naturalized. Now, Donald
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~But I will say &mdash;
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida. We had Boko Haram. We had Hamas. We had Hezbollah. We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America. It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~I'm going to &mdash; he had no fewer than 11 attacks there. I appreciate your dumping your [inaudible] research folder on the debate stage.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~I'm going to get a response to that, Neil. There's no way he launches 11 attack &mdash;
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees. It enabled him &mdash; the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.I think that's a mistake. That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it. And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries. I voted yes to suspend that. Marco voted on the other side. So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Maria
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Maria, I'd just like to say [crosstalk]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Neil  [crosstalk]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~on Larry Tribe. Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is. He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore. He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter. And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~on the issue &mdash; on the issue of citizenship, Donald
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~So let's start &mdash; let's start with immigration. Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity. Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty. I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King. Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals. I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship. And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion. What he said, and he said it in the last, it's simply not true. And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Thanks for coming back to me, Maria. Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground. Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered. You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere. They discussed how &mdash; how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers. They're protectionist. But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports. So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS [applause] and here's the critical point, Maria &mdash; the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.It's tax-free &mdash; a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers &mdash; and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax. It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds. The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal [bell rings] tariffs that come against us. It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~The answer is simple. Your prosecute criminals. You target the bad guys. You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do &mdash; done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general. Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns. He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials. And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters &mdash; the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.And I'll note that California senator &mdash; Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would. And let me make a final point on this. Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment. Unless you are clinically insane [laughter] that's what you say in a primary. But the voters are savvier than that. They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words. I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment. There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race. There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award [bell rings] and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans &mdash; we defeated that gun control legislation.And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero. And Mr. Trump is very focused
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times. You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views. The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz." Had that actually &mdash; that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships. Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate &mdash; unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars. When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars. He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks. And the entire New York times attack &mdash; is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing. But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other. But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court. And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat. A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.This is a business flat tax. It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax. It goes away. It enables us to eliminate the death tax.If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone. We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes. And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine. Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent. Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent. My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS. Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity. We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all [bell rings] the mandates and have a simple flat tax. The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan. I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.Let me start &mdash; I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something. Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran. President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei. And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking. But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage. [applause] And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America. [applause] Now, on to your substantive question. The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs. And you know, he's right. If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great. The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama. But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977. Median wages have stagnated. And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening. [laughter and applause] You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there. There was nothing to this birther issue. [laughter] Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed. [laughter]But the poll numbers have. [applause]And I recognize &mdash; I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa. But the facts and the law here are really quite clear. Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen. That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen. That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on &mdash; some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~What &mdash; what &mdash; you're from New York? So you might not. [laughter]But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do. [applause]And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York. But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.And &mdash; and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked &mdash; my friend Donald has taken to it as advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?" And &mdash; and &mdash; you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert. And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.And his explanation &mdash; he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York. Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York." And so that was his explanation. And &mdash; and I guess I can &mdash; can frame it another way. Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan. I'm just saying. [laughter]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism. What should we do? First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport. [applause] And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced [bell rings] that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory. Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists. If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida. When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS [applause].
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in North Charleston, South Carolina~January 14, 2016~You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are. [laughter]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Can I &mdash; can I &mdash; can I just
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Can I correct
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~He's an OK doctor. [laughter and applause]    But, you know, the fact of the matter is, we have extremely well-documented proof that there's no autism associated with vaccinations. But it is true that we are probably giving way too many in too short a period of time. And a lot of pediatricians now recognize that, and, I think, are cutting down on the number and the proximity in which those are done, and I think that's appropriate.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Hi, I'm Ben Carson, and I'm a retired pediatric neurosurgeon. I'm here with my wife, Candy, of 40 years, and two of my sons, and their wives. I stress the pediatric part of my career because the reason that I've gotten involved in this race is because I'm very concerned about the future of our children, and the direction of our country is one that does not portend well, unless we, the people, intervene and retake our rightful place at the pinnacle. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I'd put my mother on there. You know, she was one of 24 children, got married at age 13, had only a third grade education, had to raise two sons by herself, refused to be a victim. Wouldn't let us be victims, and has been an inspiration to many people. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I have no argument with having a strong leader, and to be aggressive where aggression is needed. But it is not needed in every circumstance. There is a time when you can use your intellect to come up with other ways to do things. And I think that's what we have to start thinking about. There is no question that a lot of these problems that we have been talking about in terms of the international situation is because we are weak. It is because our Navy is so small. It is because our Air Force is incapable of doing the same things that it did a few years ago. It's because our Marines Corps is not ready to be deployed.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I haven't had an opportunity to weigh in on foreign policy, and I just want to mention that when the war, when the issue occurred in 2003, I suggested to President Bush that he not go to war? OK. So I just want that on the record. And, you know, a lot of people are very much against us getting involved right now with global jihadism. And they refer back to our invasion of Iraq. And they seem to think that that was what caused it. What caused it was withdrawing from there and creating a vacuum which allowed this terrible situation to occur. But it is very different from what is going on today. We're talking about global jihadists who actually want to destroy us. They are an existential threat to our nation. And we have to be mature enough to recognize that our children will have no future if we put our heads in the sand. We have to recognize we have two choices. We either allow them the continue to progress and appear to be the winners, or we use every resource available to us to destroy
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~It's all about America. You know, the people who say the guy who paid a billion dollars because he had 10, he has still got $9 billion left, that's not fair, we need to take more of his money. That's called socialism. That doesn't work so well. What made America into a great nation was the fact that we said, that guy just put in $1 billion, let's create an environment that's even more conducive to his success so that next year he can put in $2 billion. And that's the kind of thing that helps us to grow. We can't grow by continuing to take a piece of pie, and dividing it, and redistributing it. But, I'm also looking at what doctor &mdash; at what Governor Huckabee talked about
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake, can I say something about that?
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake, Jake
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~My plan is not amnesty for a number of reasons. Number one, you know, I've talked to farmers, and they said they cannot hire Americans to do the kind of job that I'm talking about. And the second reason is because the individuals who register as guest workers, they don't get to vote, they are not American citizens, and they don't get the rights and privileges of American citizens. So that's key. But the other thing that I want to bring up is, I mentioned something earlier. I think it was just sort of glossed over. I talked about the success in Yuma County, I mean, incredible success, and the Department of Justice said, "No, we don't want to do that. That's too successful." We don't have to keep reinventing the wheel. All we have to do is look at things that work. All we have to do is use a little common sense.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Not exactly what I said.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~OK.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~on to our property, it's ridiculous.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~One Nation.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~The Fair Tax. Looking at both of them, and evaluating them both, and I'm talking to the American people because one of the things we must recognize is that this country is of, for, and by the people. And, it's really time that the government get out of the way, and let the people be the ones who decide how they want to run their country. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~them first.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~There are a lot of problems that are going on, and we need to solve those problems, we need to build up our military
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Typically, politicians do things that are politically expedient. And they are looking for whatever their particular goal is. That is not the reason that I have gotten into this thing. I'm extraordinary concerned about the direction of this country, the divisiveness that is going on, fiscal irresponsibility, the failure to take a leadership position in the world. All of those things will lead to a situation where the next generation will not have a chance that we've had now. So I don't &mdash; I don't want to really get into describing who's a politician and who's not a politician, but I think the people have kind of made that decision for themselves already, and will continue to do so as time goes on.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, first of all, I recognize that we have an incredible illegal immigration problem. I was down in Arizona a few weeks ago at the border. I mean, the fences that were there were not manned, and those are the kind of fences when I was a kid that would barely slow us down. So, I don't see any purpose in having that. Now, what we need to do is look at something that actually works. Yuma County, Arizona. They stop 97 percent of the illegal immigrants through there. They put in a double fence with a road so that there was quick access by the enforcement people. If we don't seal the border, the rest of this stuff clearly doesn't matter. It's kind of ridiculous all the other things we talk about. We have the ability to do it, we don't have the will to do it. There was one area where they had cut a hole in the fence, and to repair it, they put a few strands of barb wire across. Well, the photographers who were there with us, they wanted to photograph us from the side of the Mexicans, and they went through there, and they were not physically fit people, and they took their cameras and things with them, and shot us from the other side. That's how easy it is to get across. And, the drugs, I mean, it goes on, and on, and on. ICE tells them to release these people, 67,000 criminals released
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, first of all, let me say what I actually said about raising the minimum wage. I was asked should it be raised, I said, probably, or possibly. But, what I added, which I think is the most important thing, so, I said we need to get both sides of this issue to sit down, and talk about it. Negotiate a reasonable minimum wage, and index that so that we never have to have this conversation again in the history of America. I think we also have to have two minimum wages, a starter, and a sustaining because how are young people ever going to get a job if you have such a high minimum wage that it makes it impractical to hire them
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, I have also said, if anybody knows how to do that, that I would be willing to listen. And, if they can, you know, specify exactly how that's going to be done, and what the cost, and it sounds reasonable, then I think it's worth discussing
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, let me put it this way, there has &mdash; there have been numerous studies, and they have not demonstrated that there is any correlation between vaccinations and autism. This was something that was spread widely 15 or 20 years ago, and it has not been adequately, you know, revealed to the public what's actually going on. Vaccines are very important. Certain ones. The ones that would prevent death or crippling. There are others, there are a multitude of vaccines which probably don't fit in that category, and there should be some discretion in those cases. But, you know, a lot of this is &mdash; is &mdash; is pushed by big government. And I think that's one of the things that people so vehemently want to get rid of, big government. You know, we have 4.1 million federal employees. Six hundred and fifty federal agencies and department (sic). That's why they have to take so much of our taxes.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, recognize that, you know, President George W. Bush is a great friend of ours, and we spent many wonderful days at the White House. I haven't been there in the last seven years. I probably have to have a food-tester. [laughter] But at any rate, I didn't suggest that nothing be done. What I suggested to President Bush is to be Kennedy-esque, in the sense that when the Russians got ahead of us in the space race, what we did is use the bully pulpit to galvanize everybody, business, industry, academia behind a national goal to put a man on the moon and bring him back safely. I said, you can do the same kind of thing. Declare that within five to 10 years we will become petroleum independent. The moderate Arab states would have been so concerned about that, they would have turned over Osama bin Laden and anybody else you wanted on a silver platter within two weeks. There are smart ways to do things and there are muscular ways to do things. And sometimes you have to look at both of those to come up with the right solution. [crosstalk]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, what I said, after we seal the borders, after we turn off the spigot that dispenses all the goodies so we don't have people coming in here, including employment, that people who had a pristine record, we should consider allowing them to become guest workers, primarily in the agricultural sphere, because that's the place where Americans don't seem to want to work. That's what I said. And they have a six-month period to do that. If they don't do it within that time period, then they become illegal, and as illegals, they will be treated as such.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, you know, I've just explained it to him. He can read about it if he wants to. I think he's an intelligent man and will make the correct decision after getting the real facts.
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, you know, I was a radical Democrat before I started listening to Ronald Reagan. And he didn't sound like what they said Republicans were. He sounded logical. And I hope that I sound logical also. Because when I look at what is going on with the United States of America, I see a lot of things that are not logical. I see us allowing people to divide us, when in fact our strength is in our unity. I see people exercising the most irresponsible fiscal habits that anyone could possibly do. And hiding it from the American people, so that the majority of people have no idea what our financial situation is. So, when someone comes along and says, free college, free phones, free this and that, and the other, they say, "wow, that's nice," having no idea that they're destabilizing our position. And I think also that Ronald Reagan was a master at understanding that a pinnacle nation has to be a nation that leads. If we learn to lead in the Middle East right now, a coalition will form behind us, but never they do it if we just sit there and talk about it. Real leadership is what I would hopefully bring to America. [applause]
Ben Carson~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~You know, when I entered this race, all the political pundits said it's impossible; you can't do it because you're not connected with the money. And there's no way that you can raise what you need in order to compete successfully. I in no way am willing to get in the bed with special interest group or lick the boots of billionaires. I have said to the people if they want me to do this, please get involved. And we now have over 500,000 donations, and the money is coming in. But the pundits forgot about one thing, and that is the people. And they are really in charge.

Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Dana, I'd like to
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Dana, I would like to link these two issues, both of which are incredibly important, Iran and Planned Parenthood. One has something to do with the defense of the security of this nation. The other has something to do with the defense of the character of this nation. You have not heard a plan about Iran from any politician up here, here is my plan. On day one in the Oval Office, I will make two phone calls, the first to my good friend to Bibi Netanyahu to reassure him we will stand with the state of Israel. The second, to the supreme leader, to tell him that unless and until he opens every military and every nuclear facility to real anytime, anywhere inspections by our people, not his, we, the United States of America, will make it as difficult as possible and move money around the global financial system. We can do that, we don't need anyone's cooperation to do it. And every ally and every adversary we have in this world will know that the United States in America is back in the leadership business, which is how we must stand with our allies. As regards Planned Parenthood, anyone who has watched this videotape, I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama to watch these tapes. Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, it's heart beating, it's legs kicking while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain. This is about the character of our nation, and if we will not stand up in and force President Obama to veto this bill, shame on us. [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Dana, with all being said to Mr. Trump
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~First let me say, We have just spent a good bit of time discussing, as Republicans, how to solve this problem. I would ask your audience at home to ask a very basic question. Why have Democrats not solved this problem? President Obama campaigned in 2007 and 2008 on solving the immigration problem. He entered Washington with majorities in the House and the Senate. He could have chosen to do anything to solve this pro &mdash; this problem. Instead, he chose to do nothing. Why? because the Democrats don't want this issue solved.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Good evening. My story, from secretary to CEO, is only possible in this nation, and proves that everyone of us has potential. My husband, Frank, of 30 years, started out driving a tow truck for a family owned auto body shop. We have come to a pivotal point in our nation's history where this nation's possibilities and potential are being crushed by a government grown so big, so powerful, so inept, so corrupt, and a political class that refuses to do anything about it. I am prepared to lead the resurgence of this great nation. [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Having
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Having met Vladimir Putin, I wouldn't talk to him at all. We've talked way too much to him. What I would do, immediately, is begin rebuilding the Sixth Fleet, I would begin rebuilding the missile defense program in Poland, I would conduct regular, aggressive military exercises in the Baltic states. I'd probably send a few thousand more troops into Germany. Vladimir Putin would get the message. By the way, the reason it is so critically important that every one of us know General Suleimani's name is because Russia is in Syria right now, because the head of the Quds force traveled to Russia and talked Vladimir Putin into aligning themselves with Iran and Syria to prop up Bashar al- Assad. Russia is a bad actor, but Vladimir Putin is someone we should not talk to, because the only way he will stop is to sense strength and resolve on the other side, and we have all of that within our control. We could rebuild the Sixth Fleet. I will. We haven't. We could rebuild the missile defense program. We haven't. I will. We could also, to Senator Rubio's point, give the Egyptians what they've asked for, which is intelligence. We could give the Jordanians what they've asked for
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Having met Vladimir Putin, if I may
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I agree with Senator Paul. I agree with states' rights. But we are misleading young people when we tell them that marijuana is just like having a beer. It's not. And the marijuana that kids are smoking today is not the same as the marijuana that Jeb Bush smoked 40 years ago. [laughter] We do &mdash; sorry, Barbara. We do need &mdash; we do need criminal justice reform. We have the highest incarceration rates in the world. Two-thirds of the people in our prisons are there for non-violent offenses, mostly drug related. It's clearly not working. But we need to tell young people the truth. Drug addiction is an epidemic, and it is taking too many of our young people. I know this sadly from personal experience.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I led Hewlett Packard through a very difficult time, the worst technology recession in 25 years. The NASDAQ stock index fell 80 percent. It took 15 years for the stock index to recover. We had very strong competitors who literally went out of business and lost all of their jobs in the process. Despite those difficult times, we doubled the size of the company, we quadrupled its topline growth rate, we quadrupled its cash flow, we tripled its rate of innovation. Yes, we had to make tough choices, and in doing so, we saved 80,000 jobs, went on to grow to 160,000 jobs. And now Hewlett Packard is almost 300,000 jobs. We went from lagging behind to leading in every product category and every market segment. We must lead in this nation again, and some tough calls are going to be required. But as for the firing, I have been very honest about this from the day it happened. When you challenge the status quo, you make enemies. I made a few. Steve Jobs told me that when he called me the day I was fired to say, hey, been there, done that twice. It's also true that the man that led my firing, Tom Perkins, just took &mdash;
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I think what this nation can be and must be is symbolized by Lady Liberty and Lady Justice. Lady Liberty stands tall and strong. She is clear-eyed and resolute. She doesn't shield her eyes from the realities of the world, but she faces outward into the world nevertheless, as we always must. And she holds her torch high, because she knows she is a beacon of hope in a very troubled world. And Lady Justice, Lady Justice holds a sword by her side, because she is a fighter, a warrior for the values and the principles that have made this nation great. She holds a scale in her other hand. And with that scale she says all of us are equal in the eyes of God. And so all of us must be equal in the eyes of the law and the government, powerful and powerless alike. And she wears a blindfold. And with that blindfold she is saying to us that it must be true, it can be true that in this country, in this century, it doesn't matter who you are, it doesn't matter what you look like, it doesn't matter how you start, it doesn't matter your circumstances, here in this nation, every American's life must be filled with the possibilities that come from their God-given gifts. One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I very much hope I am the only person on this stage who can say this, but I know there are millions of Americans out there who will say the same thing. My husband Frank and I buried a child to drug addiction. So, we must invest more in the treatment of drugs.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I will. We could arm the Kurds. They've been asking us for three years. All of this is within our control. [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I wouldn't change the $10 bill, or the $20 bill. I think, honestly, it's a gesture. I don't think it helps to change our history. What I would think is that we ought to recognize that women are not a special interest group. Women are the majority of this nation. We are half the potential of this nation, and this nation will be better off when every woman has the opportunity to live the life she chooses. [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Immigration did not come up in 2016 because Mr. Trump brought it up. We talked about it in 2012, we talked about it in 2008. We talked about it in 2004.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake &mdash; Jake
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake, [inaudible]  [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake, I'll tell you &mdash; I'll tell you why people are supporting outsiders. It's because you know what happens if someone's been in the system their whole life, they don't know how broken the system is. A fish swims in water, it doesn't know it's water. It's not that politicians are bad people, it's that they've been in that system forever. The truth is 75 percent of the American people think the government is corrupt; 82 percent of the American people think these problems that have festered for 50 years in some cases, 25 years in other cases. The border's been insecure for 25 years; 307,000 veterans have died waiting for health care. These things have gone on for so long because no one will challenge the status quo. You know what a leader does? They challenge the status quo, they solve problems that have festered for a long time and they produce results. That is what my whole life has been about. People know this is about far more than replacing a D with an R &mdash;
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake, may I just say
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake, since everyone has gotten to weigh in on this military issue, I'd like to be able to do the same. We have spent probably 12 minutes talking about the past. Let's talk about the future. We need the strongest military on the face of the planet, and everyone has to know it. And, specifically, what that means is we need about 50 Army brigades, we need about 36 Marine battalions, we need somewhere between 300, and 350 naval ships, we need to upgrade every leg of the nuclear triad
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake?
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~mostly, apparently, leadership
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~OK.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Problems have festered in Washington for too long. And the potential of this nation is being crushed.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Secretariat.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~That's not for me to answer; it is for the voters of this country to answer, and I have a lot of faith in the common sense and good judgment of the voters of the United States of America.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~the kind of leadership that understands how to get results.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~the truth is, you can't just wave your hands and say "the 14th Amendment is gonna go away." It will take an extremely arduous vote in Congress, followed by two-thirds of the states, and if that doesn't work to amend the Constitution, then it is a long, arduous process in court. And meanwhile, what will continue to go on is what has gone on for 25 years. With all due respect, Mr. Trump, we've been talking about illegal immigration for 25 years. San Francisco has been a sanctuary city since 1989. There are 300 of them. And meanwhile, what has happened? Nothing. The border remains insecure. The legal immigration system remains broken. Look, we know what it takes to secure a border. We've heard a lot of great ideas here. Money, manpower, technology
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~They want it to be an issue that they can use. As to birthright citizenship
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~to invest in our military technology, and we need to care for our veterans so 307,000
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~We have been talking about it for 25 years. This is why people are tired of politicians.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~We just spent &mdash; we just spent the last 10 minutes
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~we need to reform the Department of Defense, we need as well
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well &mdash;
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, I thought we had been hearing quite a bit about Govenor Christie's record as governor, actually. I think track records are very important. I completely agree that what's at stake here is the future of this nation, and the future of every American. But I do think that a track record of leadership is vital because in the end this election is about leadership. And let's talk about what leadership is. It's not about braggadocio, it is about challenging the status quo, solving problems, producing results. And the highest calling of leadership is to unlock potential in others.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, Mr. Trump &mdash;
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~You know, I think Mr. Trump is a wonderful entertainer. He's been terrific at that business. I also think that one of the benefits of a presidential campaign is the character and capability, judgment and temperament of every single one of us is revealed over time and under pressure. All of us will be revealed over time and under pressure. I look forward to a long race.
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~You know, it's interesting to me, Mr. Trump said that he heard Mr. Bush very clearly and what Mr. Bush said. I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said. [applause]
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~You know, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is a well-known Clintonite and honestly had it out for me from the moment that I arrived at Hewlett Packard. But honestly, Mr. Trump, I find it quite rich that you would talk about this. You know, there are a lot of us Americans who believe that we are going to have trouble someday paying back the interest on our debt because politicians have run up mountains of debt using other people's money. That is in fact precisely the way you ran your casinos. You ran up mountains of debt, as well as losses, using other people's money, and you were forced to file for bankruptcy not once &mdash;
Carly Fiorina~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~You see, Governor Christie, people spend time talking about their track records, and Mr. Trump and I have every right to do the same. And Mrs. Clinton has to defend her track record. Her track record of lying about Benghazi, of lying about her e- mails, about lying about her servers. She does not have a track record of accomplishment. Like Mrs. Clinton, I, too, have travels hundreds of thousands of miles around the globe. But unlike Mrs. Clinton, I know flying is an activity, not an accomplishment. Mrs. Clinton &mdash; if you want to stump a Democrat, ask them to name a accomplishment of Mrs. Clinton's.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~And Senator Paul knows that that's simply not the truth. In New Jersey, we have medical marijuana laws, which I supported and implemented. This is not medical marijuana. There's goes as much &mdash; a further step beyond. This is recreational use of marijuana. This is much different. And so, while he would like to use a sympathetic story to back up his point, it doesn't work. I'm not against medical marijuana. We do it in New Jersey. But I'm against the recreational use against marijuana. If he wants to change the federal law, get Congress to pass the law to change it, and get a president to sign it.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~And why don't we do the same thing with Planned Parenthood?
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Be honest, Ben, be honest.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~First of, Jake, I don't yield to anybody on how to enforce the law. I'm the only person on this stage who spent seven years as a United States Attorney after September 11th, and I know how to do this. The fact is though that for 15,000 people a day to be deported every day for two years is an undertaking that almost none of us could accomplish given the current levels of funding, and the current number of law enforcement officers. Here's what we need to do, and I think this is where Donald is absolutely right. What we need to do is to secure our border, and we need to do it with more than just a wall. We need to use electronics, we need to use drones, we need to use FBI, DEA, and ATF, and yes, we need to take the fingerprint of every person who comes into this country on a visa, and when they overstay their visa, we need to tap them on the shoulder, and say, "You have overstayed your welcome, you're taking advantage of the American people. It's time for you to go." If we had that kind of system in place, we wouldn't have the 11 million people we have now.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Hi, my name is Chris Christie, and I'd like to you take the camera off me and put it on the audience because I'd like to ask all of you, how many of you, raise your hand, believe that in today's Barak Obama America your children will have a better life than you've had? You see? That's why I'm running for President. because leadership is not about me, it's about our country. And, what we talk about tonight, it's not about us, it's about the people in the audience tonight, because in seven short years this president has stripped away their trust, and their faith, and their belief that the next generation will have a better life. He's stolen that from us, and when I'm president, I'm going to take it back. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I don't think Senator Rubio is a skeptic of climate change. I think what Senator Rubio said I agree with. That in fact we don't need this massive government intervention to deal with the problem. Look at what we have done in New Jersey. We have already reached our clean air goals for 2020. And when I was governor, I pulled out of the regional cap and trade deal, the only state in the Northeast that did that. And we still reached our goals. Why? Because 53 percent of our electricity comes from nuclear. We use natural gas. We use solar power. We're the third-highest- using solar power state. You know why? Because we made all of those things economically feasible. I agree with Marco. We shouldn't be destroying our economy in order to chase some wild left-wing idea that somehow us by ourselves is going to fix the climate. We can contribute to that and be economically sound. We have proven we can do that in New Jersey. Nuclear needs to be back on the table in a significant way in this country if we want to go after this problem. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I put it in the list, Dana. We should be doing these things and forcing the president to take action.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I think the Adams family has been shorted in the currency business. Our country wouldn't be here without John Adams, and he would not have been able to do it without Abigal Adams, so, I'd put Abigail Adams on the bill. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I turned 18 in 1980, and my first vote was for Ronald Reagan. Boy, am I glad I did it. And I think the country is, too. A Christie presidency won't be about me. It will be about you. Tonight, you sit at home in your living room, frustrated that you play by the rules, you pay the taxes, you do the hard things to raise your family, yet you feel like America's generosity is being taken advantage of. That you've been &mdash; system is being gamed, and that you're turning out to fall further and further behind. Our presidency &mdash; our presidency &mdash; will be about ending that, about enforcing the law, level the playing field for everybody, and once again reward those folks who play by the rules, and think that justice means more than just the word. But it means a way of life. And I will tell you this, around the world, I will not shake hands with, I will not meet with, and I will not agree to anything with a country that says death to us and death to Israel and holds our hostages while we sign agreements with them. It will be an America that be strong and resolute, and will once again be able to stick out its chest and say, "we truly are the greatest nation in the world, because we live our lives that way, each and every day." [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I understand. No, no, listen, everybody makes a mistake every once in a while, Jake, even George Shultz. And if that's truly a representation of what he believes we should be doing, then with all due respect to the former secretary of state, I disagree with him.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I was &mdash; [crosstalk]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake listen. While I'm as entertained as anyone by this personal back-and-forth about the history of Donald and Carly's career, for the 55-year-old construction worker out in that audience tonight who doesn't have a job, who can't fund his child's education, I've got to tell you the truth. They could care less about your careers, they care about theirs. [applause] Let's start talking about that on this stage and stop playing &mdash; and stop playing the games. Stop playing &mdash;
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake, you brought my issue up.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~John &mdash; I'm not done yet, John.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Let's force him to do what he says he's going to do. Now I don't know whether he'll do it or not, but let's force him to do it.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Let me say this, Jake, is that while that may have been a fine idea that Dr. Carson had, these people were out to kill us. I stood in that region with my family, and every time a plane went overhead in the weeks after that, people's heads jerked to the sky because they thought it was happening again. You do not need to go through subtle diplomacy at that point. That could be handled later on. What you need is a strong American leader who will take the steps that are necessary to protect our nation. That's what I would do as commander-in-chief in this circumstance. And that's what President George W. Bush did in 2001. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Listen, you know, Hugh, it's an important point. And the question is, who is going to prosecute Hillary Clinton? The Obama White House seems to have in interest, the Justice Department seems to have no interest. I think it's time to put a former federal prosecutor on the same stage as Hillary Clinton. [applause] And I will prosecute her during those debates on that stage for the record we're talking about here. The fact she had a private email server in her basement, using national security secrets running through it, could have been hacked by the Russians, the Chinese, or two 18-year-olds on a toot (ph) wanting to have some fun. No one is answering that question from the Hillary Clinton campaign
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Look at him smiling at me right now. I know Ben didn't mean it about me. One of these other guys, I'm sure.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~No, it's not. But with Donald, it's a good start. That's really good. [laughter] No, listen. This is an issue that &mdash; that we've gotta talk about, and we haven't talked about yet. 71 percent of all federal spending is on entitlements and debt service. When John Kennedy was elected president in 1960, it was 26 percent. Harvard and Dartmouth says that Social Security's going to go insolvent in seven to eight years. So what I say is very simple. We need to save this program for the good people out there who have paid into the system and need it. And if that means making sure that folks like Donald and many of us on the stage don't get it, that's the right thing to do because here's what Hillary Clinton is going to want to do. She's going to want to put more money into a system that has already lied to us and stolen from us. This government doesn't need more money to make Social Security solvent. We need to be not paying out benefits to people who don't really need it. We need to protect the people who Social Security means the difference between picking between heat and rent and food. That's why I put out the proposal and that's the people I'm trying to [crosstalk]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~See, Jake, it wasn't me. [laughter]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~She is, and so if she, based on conscience, can't sign that &mdash; that marriage license, then there should be someone in her office to be able to do it, and if the law needs to be changed in the state of Kentucky, which is what she's advocating, it should be changed.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Stop &mdash; and stop playing &mdash; and Carly &mdash; Carly, listen. You can interrupt everybody else on this stage, you're not going to interrupt me, OK? The fact is that we don't want to hear about your careers, back and forth and volleying back and forth about who did well and who did poorly. You're both successful people. Congratulations. You know who's not successful? The middle class in this country who's getting plowed over by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Let's start talking about those issues tonight and stop this childish back-and-forth between the two of you. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~We elected a Republican Congress to do this. And they should be doing it, and they're not. And they're giving the president a pass.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, I know Ben wasn't talking about me, I'm sure he was talking about one of the other guys, not me. [laughter] As far as being an outsider is concerned &mdash; as far as being an outsider is concerned, let me tell you this, Jake, I'm a Republican in New Jersey. I wake up every morning as an outsider. I wake up every morning with a Democratic legislature who trying to beat my head in and fight me because I'm trying to bring conservative change to a state that needed it desperately. And so, everyone can talk us here about their credentials. But the bottom line is, every morning I get up, I veto 400 bills from a crazy liberal Democratic legislature, not one of them has been overridden. I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history, according to Americans for Tax Reform. What folks want in this country is somebody to go down there and get the job done. And that's exactly what I'll do. So, I know this much, that what the American people want to hire right now is somebody who believes in them. And believes that they are the ones who can fix our country. I will be the vessel through which they can fix this country, but it's not about me. It's about all of you. And getting this government off your back and out of your way, and letting you succeed. I know Ben wasn't talking about me.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, Jake, I was named U.S. attorney by President Bush on September 10th, 2001. And that next day my wife Mary Pat did what she did every day, she traveled through the World Trade Center and went to her office two blocks from the World Trade Center. And after those planes hit, for five-and-a-half-hours after that, I couldn't reach her, didn't know whether she was dead or alive, and we had three children at the time, 8, 5 and 1. And I had to confront what so many thousands of others in my region had to confront, the idea I might become a single parent, the idea that my life and my children's life might be changed forever. We lost friends that day. We went to the funerals. And I will tell you that what those people wanted and what they deserved was for America to answer back against what had been done to them. And I support what President Bush did at that time, going into Afghanistan, hunting al Qaeda and its leaders, getting its sanctuary out of place, and making it as difficult around the world for them to move people and money. And then he went to prosecutors like us, and he said, never again. Don't prosecute these people after the crime is committed. Intervene before the crime happens. I absolutely believe that what the president did at the time was right. And I am proud to have been one of the people on the stage who was part of making sure that what Governor Bush said before was the truth. America was safe for those seven years and Barack Obama has taken that safety away from us. [applause]
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~You know why? Because she knows she's wrong, and she cannot look in the mirror at herself, and she cannot tell the American people the truth.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~You know, I've been called a lot of names by a lot of different people, and now I got to get called by names by the Secret Service? I would just say True Heart.
Chris Christie~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~You know, I enjoy the interplay. Thank you, gentlemen. I'll just say this, first off, New Jersey is the first state in the nation that now says if you are non-violent, non-dealing drug user, that you don't go to jail for your first offense. You go to mandatory treatment. You see, Jake, I'm pro-life. And I think you need to be pro-life for more than just the time in the womb. It gets tougher when they get out of the womb. And when they're the 16-year-old drug addict in the Florida county lockup, that life is just as precious as the life in the womb. And so, that's why I'm for rehabilitation, why I think the war on drugs has been a failure. But I'll end with this. That doesn't mean we should be legalizing gate way drugs. And if Senator Paul thinks that the only victim is the person, look at the decrease in productivity, look at the way people get used and move on to other drugs when they use marijuana as a gateway drug, it is not them that are the only victims. Their families are the victims too, their children are the victims too, and their employers are the victims also. That's why I'll enforce the federal law, while you can still put an emphasis on rehabilitation, which we've done in New Jersey.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~&mdash; Carly, Carly &mdash;
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~&mdash; I've made over $10 billion. I had a casino company &mdash; Caesars just filed for bankruptcy. Chris will tell you &mdash; it's not Chris' fault either &mdash; but almost everybody in Atlantic City is either in trouble or filed for &mdash; maybe I'll blame Chris.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~&mdash; let me &mdash; well, let me just explain. The head of the Yale Business School, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, wrote a paper recently, one of the worst tenures for a CEO that he has ever seen, ranked one of the top 20 in the history of business. The company is a disaster and continues to be a disaster. They still haven't recovered. In fact, today, on the front page of the Wall Street Journal, they fired another 25 or 30,000 people saying we still haven't recovered from the catastrophe. When Carly says the revenues went up, that's because she bought Compaq, it was a terrible deal, and it really led to the destruction of the company. Now one other company before that was Lucent. Carly was at Lucent before that. And Lucent turned out to be a catastrophe also. So I only say this. She can't run any of my companies. That I can tell you.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~&mdash; they have used the laws of the land, which is the &mdash; [crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~[inaudible]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~[inaudible] I'm &mdash; and I'm meeting with people that are terrific people, but I have to say something because it's about judgment. I am the only person on this dais &mdash; the only person &mdash; that fought very, very hard against us (ph), and I wasn't a sitting politician going into Iraq, because I said going into Iraq &mdash; that was in 2003, you can check it out, check out &mdash; I'll give you 25 different stories. In fact, a delegation was sent to my office to see me because I was so vocal about it. I'm a very militaristic person, but you have to know when to use the military. I'm the only person up here that fought against going into Iraq. [crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~And that's all I'm saying, Jake. That's all I'm saying.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~And we had a legitimate misunderstanding in terms of his pronunciation of a word. But I would say just  [laughter]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~As a policy, I would almost leave it up to the people. Don't forget they pay in and they pay in, and maybe they do well, and maybe some people want it. But the fact is that there are people that truly don't need it, and there are many people that do need it very, very badly. And I would be willing to write mine off 100 percent, Dana.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~As I said, we are spending $200 billion &mdash; we are spending $200 billion a year on maintaining what we have. We will move them out. The great ones will come back, the good ones will come back. They'll be expedited, they'll be back, they'll come back legally. We'll have a country &mdash; they'll come back, legally.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Autism has become an epidemic. Twenty-five years ago, 35 years ago, you look at the statistics, not even close. It has gotten totally out of control. I am totally in favor of vaccines. But I want smaller doses over a longer period of time. Because you take a baby in &mdash; and I've seen it &mdash; and I've seen it, and I had my children taken care of over a long period of time, over a two or three year period of time. Same exact amount, but you take this little beautiful baby, and you pump &mdash; I mean, it looks just like it's meant for a horse, not for a child, and we've had so many instances, people that work for me. Just the other day, two years old, two and a half years old, a child, a beautiful child went to have the vaccine, and came back, and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic. I only say it's not &mdash; I'm in favor of vaccines, do them over a longer period of time, same amount.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~But Atlantic City is a disaster &mdash;
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~But I do hear she's a lovely woman.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~But I have to say
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~But just in &mdash; in little sections.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~By the way, I agree with &mdash; with what Chris is saying, but, I will say this. Illegal immigration is costing us more than $200 billion dollars a year just to maintain what we have.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Correct.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Correct. First of all, I want to build a wall, a wall that works. So important, and it's a big part of it. Second of all, we have a lot of really bad dudes in this country from outside, and I think Chris knows that, maybe as well as anybody. They go, if I get elected, first day they're gone. Gangs all over the place. Chicago, Baltimore, no matter where you look. We have a country based on laws. I will make sure that those laws are adhered to. These are illegal immigrants. I don't think you'd even be asking this question if I didn't run because when I ran, and I brought this up, my opening remarks at Trump Tower, I took heat like nobody has taken heat in a long time. And, then they found out with the killing of Katie, from San Francisco, and so many other crimes, they found out that I was right. And, most people, many people, apologized to me. I don't think you'd even be talking about illegal immigration if it weren't for me. So, we have a country of laws, they're going to go out, and they'll come back if they deserve to come back. If they've had a bad record, if they've been arrested, if they've been in jail, they're never coming back. We're going to have a country again. Right now, we don't have a country, we don't have a border, and we're going to do something about it, and it can be done with proper management, and it can be done with heart.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Don't make things up.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Don't make things up. Jeb, don't make things up. Come on.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Every major business leader has used the &mdash; I never went bankrupt, by the way, as you know, everybody knows. But we &mdash; hundreds of companies, hundreds of deals, I've used
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Every major business leader, has used the &mdash; I never went bank bankrupt, by the way, as you know, everybody knows. But &mdash; hundreds of companies, hundreds of deals, I used the law four times and made a tremendous thing. I'm in business. I did a very good job. But I will say this, and people are very, very impressed with what I've done, the business people. But when the folks of Iowa found out the true facts of the job that you've done in Wisconsin, all of a sudden you, tubed (ph), he was No. 1 and now he's No. 6 or seven in the polls. So, look, we brought it out, you were supposed to make a billion dollars in the state. You lost 2.2 &mdash; you have right now, a huge budget deficit. That's not a Democratic point. That's a point. That's a fact. And when the people of Iowa found that out, I went to No. 1 and you went down the tubes.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Excuse me.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Good.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Got along with everybody.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Humble. [laughter and applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I'd like to respond.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I'll tell you why; it's very simple.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I'll tell you. I was running &mdash;
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I'm Donald Trump. I wrote "The Art of the Deal". I say not in a braggadocious way, I've made billions and billions of dollars dealing with people all over the world, and I want to put whatever that talent is to work for this country so we have great trade deals, we make our country rich again, we make it great again. We build our military, we take care of our vets, we get rid of Obamacare, and we have a great life altogether. Thank you. Thank you. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I'm using facts.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I've actually been in politics all my life, although I've been on that side as opposed to this side. I'm now a politician for about three months. Obviously, I'm doing pretty well. I'm number one in every poll by a lot. But the qualification is that I've dealt with people all over the world, been successful all over the world. Everything I've done virtually has been a tremendous success. When markets changed, when things turned, I heard Governor Pataki, who, by the way, was a failed governor in New York, a very seriously failed &mdash; he wouldn't be elected dog catcher right now. I heard what he had to say. And I will tell you this: Atlantic City, I've made a tremendous amount of money in Atlantic City. I left seven years ago, I've gotten great credit for my timing, and that's what I'm all about. I'm a businessman, did really well, really well, and Jeb, what I want to do is put that ability into this country to make our country rich again. And I can do that, and I'm not sure that anybody else in the group will be able to do that.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I agree 100 percent, by the way, with Carly on the fact that the Democrats do not want to solve this problem, for the obvious reasons, but they do not. But I believe that a reading of the 14th Amendment allows you to have an interpretation where this is not legal and where it can't be done. I've seen both sides, but some of the greatest scholars agree with me, without having to go through Congress. If you do go through Congress, you can absolutely solve the problem.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I am doing business transactions. I will know more about this &mdash; and, as you said, that was very acceptable, and when you listen to that whole interview, it's a great interview, you said it, I didn't. Well, now I did. But [crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I believe that I will get along &mdash; we will do &mdash; between that, Ukraine, all of the other problems, we won't have the kind of problems that our country has right now with Russia and many other nations.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I didn't &mdash;
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I didn't want &mdash; it was my obligation as a businessman to my family, to my company, to my employees, to get along with all politicians. I get along with all of them, and I did a damn good job in doing it. Go ahead.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I didn't want to &mdash; excuse me. One second.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I don't know her, and this is a total mischaracterization
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I don't know. You feel safe right now? I don't feel so safe.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I don't think he's suggesting that at all.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I hope that answers your question. I mean, you are in the Senate, but I hope that answers your question.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I know my people.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I know, but why did you say it? I heard it myself. Why did you say it?
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I never attacked him on his look, and believe me, there's plenty of subject matter right there. [laughter] That I can tell you.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I never filed for bankruptcy.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I promise I would have gotten it.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I promise if I wanted it, I would have gotten it.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I think &mdash; and I think you're going to have &mdash; I think you're going to see a big impact on autism.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I think it will haunt him. I think it's a terrible. I think it's going to haunt him absolutely. He came back later and he said he misspoke. There was no question because I heard when he said the statement. I was watching and he said the statement. And I said, wow, I can't believe it. I will take care of women. I respect women. I will take care of women. One thing we will say and I would like to get back to the Iran situation. We're talking about Iran. The agreement was terrible. It was incompetent. I've never seen anything like it. One of the worst contracts of any kind I've ever seen. And nobody ever mentions North Korea where you have this maniac sitting there and he actually has nuclear weapons and somebody better start thinking about North Korea and perhaps a couple of other places. But certainly North Korea. And Ted and I have spoken. We've &mdash; a lot of us have spoken. We're talking about Iran. They are bad actors, bad things are going to happen. But in the meantime, you have somebody right now in North Korea who has got nuclear weapons and who is saying almost every other week, I'm ready to use them. And we don't even mention it.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I think she's got a beautiful face, and I think she's a beautiful woman.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I think they had a responsibility, yes.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I was &mdash; excuse me, Jeb.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I was a businessman, I got along with Clinton, I got along with everybody. That was my job, to get along with people.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I will know
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I will know more about the problems of this world by the time I sit, and you look at what's going in this world right now by people that supposedly know, this world is a mess.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I would do so much better than that.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I would have gotten it.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I wouldn't have drawn the line, but once he drew it, he had no choice but to go across. They do bear some responsibility, but I think he probably didn't do it, not for that reason. Somehow, he just doesn't have courage. There is something missing from our president. Had he crossed the line and really gone in with force, done something to Assad &mdash; if he had gone in with tremendous force, you wouldn't have millions of people displaced all over the world.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~If I become president, we will do something really special. We will make this country greater than ever before. We'll have more jobs. We'll have more of everything. We were discussing disease, we were discussing all sorts of things tonight, many of which will just be words, it will just pass on. I don't want to say politicians, all talk, no action. But a lot of what we talked about is words and it will be forgotten very quickly. If I'm president, many of the things that we discussed tonight will not be forgotten. We'll find solutions. And the world will respect us. They will respect us like never before. And it will be actually a friendlier world. And I have to say, it is a great honor to be here tonight. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~If you don't mind, Rand &mdash; you know, you are on last &mdash; you do have your 1 percent. I would like &mdash; and I think it's very important. I think it's important, because it's about judgment. It's about judgment. I didn't want to go into Iraq, and I fought it, because what I said &mdash; what I said
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~If you think about it
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~In Wisconsin, you're losing $2.2 billion right now.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jeb said
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jeb, just
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Just excuse me, one second, Rand
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Listen, just one second. Just one second.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~No, I don't think he's suggesting that at all. I mean  [crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~No, I won't do that, because I've said nothing wrong.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~No.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~No. I just will tell you that, you know, Jeb made the statement. I'm not only referring to him. I &mdash; a lot of money was raised by a lot of different people that are standing up here. And the donors, the special interests, the lobbyists have very strong power over these people. I'm spending all of my money, I'm not spending &mdash; I'm not getting any &mdash; I turned down &mdash; I turn down so much, I could have right now from special interests and donors, I could have double and triple what he's got. I've turned it down. I turned down last week $5 million from somebody. So I will tell you I understand the game, I've been on the other side all of my life. And they have a lot of control over our politicians. And I don't say that favorably, and I'm not sure if there's another system, but I say this. I am not accepting any money from anybody. Nobody has control of me other than the people of this country. I'm going to do the right thing.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Not with this intensity.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~OK, more energy tonight. I like that. [laughter] Look &mdash;
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~OK. So I will say this, though, Hugh was giving me name after name, Arab name, Arab name, and there are few people anywhere, anywhere that would have known those names. I think he was reading them off a sheet. And frankly I will have &mdash; and I told him, I will have the finest team that anybody has put together and we will solve a lot of problems. You know, right now they know a lot and look at what is happening. The world is blowing up around us. We will have great teams and great people.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Or the collapse of the economy.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Other than that we'll go with Rosa Parks. I like that.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Slow (ph) and steady, [inaudible] chicken
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~So why didn't you say it? Why didn't you say it?
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~So, number one, they have to respect you. He has absolutely no respect for President Obama. Zero. Syria's a mess. You look at what's going on with ISIS in there, now think of this: we're fighting ISIS. ISIS wants to fight Syria. Why are we fighting ISIS in Syria? Let them fight each other and pick up the remnants. I would talk to him. I would get along with him. I believe &mdash; and I may be wrong, in which case I'd probably have to take a different path, but I would get along with a lot of the world leaders that this country is not getting along with. We don't get along with China. We don't get along with the heads of Mexico. We don't get along with anybody, and yet, at the same time, they rip us left and right. They take advantage of us economically and every other way. We get along with nobody. I will get along &mdash; I think &mdash; with Putin, and I will get along with others, and we will have a much more stable &mdash; stable world.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Speaking for myself, I'm OK with it. I think there's a certain truth to it. I know people that, frankly, it has no impact on their life whatsoever. There are many people. I would almost say leave it up to them, but I would be willing to check it off, and say I will not get Social Security. I do not
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~That's true, sure.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~That's true. That's true.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~that they come into our country as an act of love. With all of the problems we that we have, in so many instances &mdash; we have wonderful people coming in. But with all of the problems &mdash; this is not an act of love. He's weak on immigration &mdash; by the way, in favor of Common Core, which is also a disaster, but weak on immigration. He doesn't get my vote.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~the Middle East, and that's what happened.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~They had a responsibility, absolutely. I think we have three of them here
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~This is a reporter, not a high school kid.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Totally false.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Wait a minute, Carly. Wait. I let you speak. Atlantic City is a disaster, and I did great in Atlantic City. I knew when to get out. My timing was great. And I got a lot of credit for it. Many of the great business people that you know &mdash; and Carl Icon (ph) is going to work with me on making great deals for this country. But whether it's Carl or so many others that we read about all the time &mdash;
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~was you're going to &mdash; you're going to destabilize
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well &mdash;
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, because she's been sitting for three hours, I think my daughter, Ivanka, who's right here. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, first of all, Rand Paul shouldn't even be on this stage. He's number 11, he's got 1 percent in the polls, and how he got up here, there's far too many people anyway. As far as temperament &mdash; and we all know that &mdash; as far as temperament, I think I have a great temperament. I built a phenomenal business with incredible, iconic assets, one of the really truly great real-estate businesses. And I may be an entertainer, because I've had tremendous success with number-one bestsellers all over the place, with "The Apprentice" and everything else I've done. But I will tell you this: What I am far and away greater than an entertainer is a businessman, and that's the kind of mindset this country needs to bring it back, because we owe $19 trillion right now, $19 trillion, and you need this kind of thinking to bring our country back. And believe me, my temperament is very good, very calm. But we will be respected outside of this country. We are not respected now. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, first of all, the &mdash; the 14th Amendment says very, very clearly to a lot of great legal scholars &mdash; not television scholars, but legal scholars &mdash; that it is wrong. It can be corrected with an act of Congress, probably doesn't even need that. A woman gets pregnant. She's nine months, she walks across the border, she has the baby in the United States, and we take care of the baby for 85 years. I don't think so. And by the way, Mexico and almost every other country anywhere in the world doesn't have that. We're the only ones dumb enough, stupid enough to have it. And people &mdash; and by the way, this is not just with respect to Mexico. They are coming from Asia to have babies here, and all of a sudden, we have to take care of the babies for the life of the baby. The 14th Amendment, it reads properly, you can go and &mdash; it's probably going to be have to be check &mdash; go through a process of court, probably ends up at the Supreme Court, but there are a lot of great legal scholars that say that is not correct. And in my opinion, it makes absolutely no &mdash; we're the only &mdash; one of the only countries, we're going to take care of those babies for 70, 75, 80, 90 years? I don't think so.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, I'd like to respond, I'd like to respond
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, I &mdash; I &mdash; I'd like to respond.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, I have to tell you, I hear phenomenal things. I hear your wife is a lovely woman
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, I heard Hugh Hewitt, a nice man, he apologized because he actually said that we had a misunderstanding. And he said today that Donald Trump is maybe the best interview there is anywhere that he has ever done. Now unless he was just saying that on CNN to be nice, but he did say that  [crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, I think it's wonderful and all, but I did it a little bit half-heartedly, but I do mean it to a large extent. We have a country, where, to assimilate, you have to speak English. And I think that where he was, and the way it came out didn't sound right to me. We have to have assimilation &mdash; to have a country, we have to have assimilation. I'm not the first one to say this, Dana. We've had many people over the years, for many, many years, saying the same thing. This is a country where we speak English, not Spanish. [applause]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, I think it was. And he actually said that. Did you say that? [crosstalk]
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, I think the thing about the flat tax, I know it very well. What I don't like is that if you make $200 million a year, you pay ten percent, you're paying very little relatively to somebody that's making $50,000 a year, and has to hire H&amp;R Block to do the &mdash; because it's so complicated. One thing I'll say to Ben is that we've had a graduated tax system for many years, so it's not a socialistic thing. What I'd like to do, and I'll be putting in the plan in about two weeks, and I think people are going to like it, it's a major reduction in taxes. It's a major reduction for the middle class. The hedge fund guys won't like me as much as they like me right now. I know them all, but they'll pay more. I know people that are making a tremendous amount of money and paying virtually no tax, and I think it's unfair.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, in Wisconsin
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, you have to understand, I am not sitting in the United States Senate with, by the way, the worst voting record there is today. Number one. I am not sitting in the United States Senate. I'm a businessman doing business transactions.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Wrong.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~You said it.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~You said you're going to cut funding for women's health. You said it.
Donald Trum~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Your brother &mdash; and your brother's administration gave us Barack Obama, because it was such a disaster, those last three months, that Abraham Lincoln couldn't have been elected.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~&mdash; because you gave her money. Maybe it works for Hillary Clinton &mdash;
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~&mdash; casino gambling before &mdash;
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~&mdash; it doesn't work for anybody on this &mdash; on stage.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~&mdash; we increased child support &mdash; we increased child support with a broken system by 90 percent.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~And I just did.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~And so we do agree, Mike.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~And why don't you apologize to her right now.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~because of what President Obama's done by pulling back.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~But the simple fact is &mdash;
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Don't cut me off.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~during and after. And that's not &mdash; I'm not going to be bought by anybody.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Ever Ready, it's very high energy, Donald. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~He did, he did. You're proud of your family, just as I am.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~He was talking about me.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Here's the deal. No, I did not oppose when the legislature passed the bill to deal with that very issue. That's the way to solve this problem. Medical marijuana on the ballot was opened up, there was a huge loophole, it was the first step to getting to a [inaudible] place. And as a citizen of Florida, I voted no.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Here's the facts: When Donald Trump talks about judgment, what was his position on who would've been the best negotiator to deal with Iran? It wasn't a Republican; it was Hillary Clinton. That's what you believe. I mean, the lack of judgment and the lack of understanding about how the world works is really dangerous in this kind of time that we're saying. So is that the judgment that you bring to the table, that Hillary Clinton
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Here's the lessons of history: When we &mdash; we pull back, voids are created. We left Iraq. We should've had a &mdash; a forces agreement to stay there with a small force, and instead of that, we politically and militarily pulled back, and now we have the creation of ISIS. 36 days ago in this very library, I gave a speech with a comprehensive strategy how to take out ISIS, and it requires American leadership and engagement. We don't have to be the world's policemen. But we certainly have to be the world's leader. We need to have &mdash; make sure that the world knows that we're serious, that we're engaged, that we're not going to pull back, that &mdash; that our &mdash; that our word matters. And if we do that, we can create a force that will take out ISIS both in Iraq and in Syria, which will take a lot longer time now
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I'm Jeb Bush, and I believe America's on the verge of its greatest century, and I'm ready to lead. I'm a committed, conservative reformer that cut taxes, that balanced budgets, that took on the special interest in Florida, and we won. I look forward to talking tonight about how we can fix a broken Washington D.C., and create an environment where people can rise up again in this great country. Thank you. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I'm on the Reagan side of this.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I &mdash; I think there needs to be a hearing, but the fact is, we need to encourage that kind of involvement. That's &mdash; that's exactly what we need to do. [crosstalk]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I don't think &mdash; you're not stating my views right.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I don't want to put poor people in jail, Randy.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I have a proven record. I have a proven record.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I think the voters will make that determination. But what I know to be true is that the next president of the United States is going to have to fix an extraordinary difficult situation. This administration, with President Obama and Hillary Clinton, has created insecurity the likes of which we never would've imagined. There's not a place in the world where we're better off today than six and a half years ago. And that requires a steadiness. That requires an understanding of how the world works. That requires an understanding and appreciation of American leadership in the world. You can't just, you know, talk about this stuff and insult leaders around the world and expect a good result. You have to do this with a steady hand, and I believe I have those skills.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I think there needs to be accommodation for someone acting on faith. Religious conscience is &mdash; is &mdash; is a first freedom. It's &mdash; it's a powerful part of our &mdash; of our Bill of Rights. And, in a big, tolerant country, we should respect the rule of law, allow people in &mdash; in &mdash; in this country &mdash; I'm a &mdash; I was opposed to the decision, but we &mdash; you can't just say, "well, they &mdash; gays can't get married now." But this woman, there should be some accommodation for her conscience, just as there should be for people that are florists that don't want to participate in weddings, or bakers. A great country like us should find a way to have accommodations for people so that we can solve the problem in the right way. This should be solved at the local level
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I was asked the question.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I would go with Ronald Reagan's partner, Margaret Thatcher. Probably illegal, but what the heck? [applause] Since it's not going to happen. A strong leader is what we need in the White House, and she certainly was a strong leader that restored the United Kingdom into greatness.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~is a great negotiator, that she could bring about a better deal on Iran?
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~John Roberts has made some really good decisions, for sure, but he did not have a proven, extensive record that would have made the clarity the important thing, and that's what we need to do. And, I'm willing to fight for those nominees to make sure that they get passed. You can't do it the politically expedient way anymore. This is the culture in Washington. You have to fight hard for these appointments. This is perhaps the most important thing that the next president will do.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Look, first of all, I wrote a book about this, three &mdash; four years ago, now. And I laid out a comprehensive, conservative approach for immigration reform. And it does require securing the border. No one disagrees with that. But to build a wall, and to deport people &mdash; half a million a month &mdash; would cost hundreds of billions of dollars, Donald. Hundreds of billions of dollars. It would destroy community life, it would tear families apart. And it would send a signal to the rest of the world that the United States values that are so important for our long-term success no longer matter in this country. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~No way. Believe me.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~No, I don't think so, but we need to be strong against China. We should use offensive tactics as it relates to cyber security, send a deterrent signal to China. There should be super sanctions in what President Obama has proposed. There's many other tools that we have without canceling a dinner. That's not going to change anything, but we can be much stronger as it relates to that. As it relates to Iran, it's not a strategy to tear up an agreement. A strategy would be how do we confront Iran? And, the first thing that we need to do is to establish our commitment to Israel which has been altered by this administration. And, make sure that they have the most sophisticated weapons to send a signal to Iran that we have Israel's back. If we do that, it's going to create a healthier deterrent effect than anything else I can think of.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~No, you're wrong &mdash; you're wrong about this.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~No. Absolutely not. People are supporting me because I have a proven record of conservative leadership where I cut taxes $19 billion over eight years. We shrunk the state government workforce, we created a climate that led the nation in job growth seven out of eight years. We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating. People know that we need principle-centered leadership, a disrupter to go to Washington, D.C. The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something &mdash; that was generous and gave me money &mdash; was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida &mdash;
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~No. The simple fact is, Donald, you could not take &mdash;
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Not even possible.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Not very far. I think we need to do this state by state. There are places that get this right, and we need to make sure that we protect the privacy laws. This is a complicated place. But I do think the natural impulse on the left &mdash; Hillary Clinton, immediately after one of these horrific violent acts took place, immediately said we need to have federal gun laws. President Obama almost reflexively always says the same thing. And the net result is, you're going to take away rights of &mdash; of law-abiding citizens, the 99.999 percent of the people that are law- abiding citizens. That's not the right approach to do it. In Florida, we have a background check. We have concealed-weapon permit holders, and in fact, there's 1,200,000 of them. We have a reduction in violent crime because we put people behind bars when they use a gun in the commission of the crime. That's the better approach. But we're living in a society today where despair kind of grows in isolation.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Right after me, and then I'll &mdash; I'll yield &mdash; yield the floor. What do you guys say in the Senate when you're talking and debating?
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~She is absolutely the love of my life, and she's right here
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~She is. She's fantastic.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Six million more people are living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president. Six million more people. The middle class has had declining income, workforce participation rates are lower than they were in 1977. For the first time in modern history, more businesses are failing than are being created. That is what the next president will have to deal with. And I believe we can reverse course by creating a strategy of high sustained economic growth, not the new normal of 2 percent that all the left says we just have to get used to, but a 4 percent growth strategy where we reform how we tax, fix the broken regulatory system, embrace the energy revolution in our midst, fix the immigration system so we can turn it into an economic driver, deal with the structural fiscal problems that exist because of our entitlement problems that will overwhelm and create way too much debt. If we grow at 4 percent, people are going to be lifted out of poverty. The great middle that defines our country will have a chance to be able to pursue their dreams as they see fit. That should be the great challenge and the great opportunity for the next president of the United States, to forge consensus to go back to a high-growth strategy. And then we'll be able to lead the world. Without a high-growth strategy, our country will never have the resources or the optimism to be able to lead the world, which the world desperately needs our leadership. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~So he supports Pelosi, he supports Schumer, he supports Clinton &mdash;
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~So you &mdash; the &mdash; the first chance
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~So, 40 years ago, I smoked marijuana, and I admit it. I'm sure that other people might have done it and may not want to say it in front of 25 million people. My mom's not happy that I just did. [laughter and applause] That's true. And here's the deal. Here's the deal. We have &mdash; we have a serious epidemic of drugs that goes way beyond marijuana. What goes on in Colorado, as far as I'm concerned, that should be a state decision. But if you look at the problem of drugs in this &mdash; in this society today, it's a serious problem. Rand, you know this because you're campaigning in New Hampshire like all of us, and you see the epidemic of heroin, the overdoses of heroin that's taking place. People's families are &mdash; are being torn apart. It is appropriate for the government to play a consistent role to be able to provide more treatment, more prevention &mdash; we're the state that has the most drug courts across every circuit in &mdash; in &mdash; in Florida, there are drug courts to give people a second chance. That's the best way to do this.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~So, here's the deal. My wife is a Mexican-American. She's an American by choice. She loves this country as much as anybody in this room, and she wants a secure border. But she wants to embrace the traditional American values that make us special and make us unique. We're at a crossroads right now. Are we going to take the Reagan approach, the hopeful optimistic approach, the approach that says that, you come to our country legally, you pursue your dreams with a vengeance, you create opportunities for all of us? Or the Donald Trump approach? The approach that says that everything is bad, that everything is coming to an end. I
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~That's &mdash; that's my brother.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~The leadership of Ronald Reagan and my [crosstalk]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~There are 13,000 community-based organizations that provide health services to women, 13,000 in this country. I don't believe that Planned Parenthood should get a penny from the federal government. Those organizations should get funding, just as I increased funding when I was governor of the state. That's the way you do this is you improve the condition for people. And, Donald, when I was governor, we also increased the opportunities for women. Women's income grew three times faster than the national average when I was governor.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~To subject my wife into the middle of a raucous political conversation was completely inappropriate, and I hope you apologize for that, Donald.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~We improved &mdash; we improved &mdash;
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~We said no. And that's the simple fact. The simple fact is &mdash;
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, first of all, he, as I said, supported John Roberts. He supported him, publicly. So, you can rewrite history, I guess, Ted, but the simple fact is that you supported him because he had all the criteria that you would have thought would have made a great justice. And, I think he is doing a good job. But, the simple fact is that going forward, what we need to do is to have someone that has a long standing set of rulings that consistently makes it clear that he is a focused, exclusively on upholding the Constitution of the United States so they won't try to use the bench as a means to which legislate.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, first of all, Hugh, if you're looking at Republican advisers, you have to go to the last two administrations. That happened to be 41 and 43. So just by definition, if you're &mdash; and many of the people here that are seeking advice from the foreign policy experts in the Republican side, they &mdash; they served in my dad's administration, my brother's administration. Of course that's the case. But I'm my own man. I'm going to create a strategy that is based on the simple fact that the United States needs to lead the world. The first thing that we need to do is to stop the craziness of the sequester. Rebuild our military so that our &mdash; so that we don't deploy people over and over again without the necessary equipment to keep them safe, to send a signal to the world that we're serious. If we're going to lead the world, then we need to have the strongest military possible. We need to rebuild our counterintelligence and intelligence capabilities. We need to focus on the fact that the next president is going to start in 2017, not in 1990 &mdash; you know, 30 years ago, or when my brother started. The world is dramatically different. And I believe that we need to restore America's presence and leadership in the world. Name a country where our relationship is better today than it was the &mdash; the day that Barack Obama got elected president. Under Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama, we have seen a weakness that now creates huge problems for the next president of the United States. So I'll have a team that will be &mdash; that will be following the doctrine I set up, and it will be peace through strength. We're sitting here in this library, which is a wonderful place to talk about this, because that's exactly what happened in the 1980s, and the world was a lot safer because of
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, he's wrong on a lot of things, but on this he's wrong because I'm the most pro-life governor on this stage. I got to act on my core beliefs. It's part of who I am. Life is a gift from God. And from beginning end we need to respect it and err on the side of life. And so I defunded Planned Parenthood. We created a climate where parental notification took place. We were the only state to fund crisis pregnancy centers with state moneys. We were totally focused on this. And I would bring that kind of philosophy to Washington, D.C. So here is a solution to this. Title X of the HHS funding, there is something that was the "Reagan Rule." It was passed in 1988. And in that rule it was defined, and the courts approved this, that a Planned Parenthood, you couldn't separate the money between the actual abortion procedures, and there are 330,000 abortions that take place in this clinic, and their promotion of it. He interpreted it the right way, the courts ruled in his favor, and Planned Parenthood did not get funding during that time until President Clinton came in. When I'm elected president, we will restore that interpretation of Title X. And this deal will be finished. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, I'm surprised Senator Cruz would say that since he was as strong supporter of John Roberts at the time. I will talk about what I will do as it relates to appointing Supreme Court Justices. We need to make sure that we have justices that, with a proven experienced record of respect for upholding the constitution. That is what we need. We can't have &mdash; the history in recent past is appoint people that have no experience so that you can't get attacked. And, that makes it harder for people to have confidence that they won't veer off
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, I've been speaking English here tonight, and I'll keep speaking English. But the simple fact is, if a high school kid asks me a question in Spanish, a school &mdash; by the way, a voucher program that was created under my watch, the largest voucher program in the country, where kids can go to a Christian school, and they ask me a question in Spanish, I'm going to show respect and answer that question in Spanish. Even though they do speak English, and even though they embrace American values. [applause]
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, I &mdash; I wanted to &mdash; be &mdash; make it easier for him.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~When he &mdash; and he &mdash; when he asked &mdash; when he asked Florida to have casino gambling, we said no.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Yeah.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Yes you did.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~You've got, according to your &mdash; to what you said on one of the talk shows, you got Hillary Clinton to go to your wedding &mdash;
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~You know what? As it relates to my brother, there's one thing I know for sure. He kept us safe. I don't know if you remember  [applause]   Donald  [applause]   you remember the &mdash; the rumble? You remember the fire fighter with his arms around it? He sent a clear signal that the United States would be strong and fight Islamic terrorism, and he did keep us safe.
Jeb Bush~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~You wanted it and you didn't get it because I was opposed to &mdash;
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~And that's how I will be president, using that experience to drive this country forward. Thank you. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~because I don't think it's going to work out.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~both places. And I did it including people in the other party. And that's how we were successful.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~But &mdash; but wait a minute. It's a lot of ad hogshead. Now, I know that it may be buzzing out there, but I think it's important we get to the issues, because that's what people want, and they don't want all this fighting.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Can I just &mdash; can I &mdash; Jake, can I just make one point on this whole military discussion?
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Dana, in a way that maximizes their value for sale for profit. It is disgusting, and the American people need to hear it
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Hello, I'm John Kasich, the Governor of Ohio. Emma, and Reese, my children, and Karen, love 'ya girls. Thanks for watching tonight. By the way, I think I actually flew on this plane with Ronald Reagan when I was a congressman, and his goals, and mine, really much &mdash; are pretty much the same. Lift Americans, unify, give hope, grow America, and restore it is to that great, shining city on a hill. Yes, he was a great one, and I learned much from watching him. The most important thing, hope to Americans, unify, lift everyone in America. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I'll tell you what &mdash; I'll tell you what I'd be willing to fight for. I'll tell you what I'd be willing to fight for. Why will (ph) we put tax reform on the president's desk, so we can simplify this tax system?
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I called for boots on the ground many months ago in a coalition with our friends who share our interest. You know, you win a battle with the military, and when we go somewhere, we need to be mobile, and lethal. We need to take care of business, and we need to come home. But, we face, also, a bigger war &mdash; and you win the bigger war with the battle of ideas. You wonder why young people, and educated people, rich people, schooled people, have tried to join ISIS. Western civilization, all of us, need to wake up to the fact that those murderers and rapists need to be called out, and in Western civilization we need to make it clear that our faith in the Jewish and Christian principals force us to live a life bigger than ourselves
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I don't at this point in terms of changing the incentives for investment and risk-taking. But let's just stop for a second. There's one person on this stage that does have a record. I'm the only person on the stage and one of the few people in this country that led the effort as the chief architect of the last time we balanced the federal budget. We also cut taxes. And when I left Washington in 2000, we had a $5 trillion surplus, and the economy was booming. I had spent 10 years of my life to get us to that point, went out in the private sector, was a great experience, and went into Ohio and took an $8 billion hole and turned it into a $2 billion surplus. We've had the largest amount of tax cuts of any sitting governor. We've grown well over 300,000 jobs. You see, I've done it in both places. I'm the only one here that has done it in both places. It took a lot to get us to a balanced budget. It was legitimate. It was real. And we negotiated it. A lot of what we're talking about here tonight as we take this position and that position, you know what? At the end of the day, America has got to work. We've got to figure out how we come together to deal with this &mdash; with our fiscal problems because when we deal with that, we create a stronger economy for everybody. People have a chance to rise. So, you know, when we think about how we make a choice, it's the person that lands that plane. It's not somebody that talks about it. It's about the person who has done it. And I've done it in
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I don't intend to do that, and I going to be out there pushing it out &mdash; don't worry about me and Hillary. That will all work out, and I'm from Ohio. She will not beat me there, I can promise you that. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~if we think &mdash; if we think they're getting close to a &mdash; to developing a nuclear weapon and we get that information, you better believe that I would do everything in my power as the commander-in-chief to stop them having a nuclear weapon.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake &mdash;
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake, Jake.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Listen, you know, I &mdash; if I were sitting at home and watch thing back and forth, I would be inclined to turn it off. I mean, people at home want to know across this country, they want to know what we're going to do to fix this place, how we'll balance a budget, how we're going to create more economic growth, how we'll pay down the debt. What we're going to do to strengthen the military. So, we just spent 10 minutes here
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~No one is &mdash; no &mdash; let me &mdash; let me suggest to you we believe that we operate better in the world when our allies work with us. President Bush did it in the Gulf War. We work better when we are unified. Secondly, nobody's trusting Iran. They violate the deal, we put on the sanctions, and we have the high moral ground to talk to our allies in Europe to get them to go with us. If they don't go with us, we slap the sanctions on anyway. If they fund these radical groups that threaten Israel and all of the West, then we should rip up the deal and put the sanctions back on. And let me make it clear &mdash; let me make it clear  [crosstalk]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~No, no, it's really important, Dana. We got to talk about what we would be willing to shut down for. Why don't we put tax reform on this president's desk, and make him veto it if that's what he wants to do? Why haven't we repealed and replaced Obamacare? Make him veto if that's what he wants to do.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~No, no, no. I want to &mdash; I want to &mdash; I want to say something about what the senator just said.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~OK, Jake.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~There's a &mdash;
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~This is a giant battle in the world today
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~to make (ph) centers (ph) of justice so that we can battle the radicals, call them out for what they are, and make sure that all of our people feel fulfilled in living in Western civilization
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~We're not &mdash; what I can tell you is this. We didn't surrender in New Jersey, six years ago, as the brand new first ever pro-life governor of New Jersey since Roe versus Wade, I defended Planned Parenthood. And I've vetoed Planned Parenthood funding, now, eight times in New Jersey. Since the day I walked in as governor, Planned Parenthood has not been funded in New Jersey. We stood up and every one of those vetoes has been sustained. But here's the problem, we're &mdash; we're fighting with each other up here. We agree. Let's ask Hillary Clinton. She believes in the systematic murder of children in the womb to preserve their body parts
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~We can have it, and we can have our allies, and we can be strong as a country, and we can project across this globe with unity, not just doing it alone. That is not what gets us where we want to get as a nation.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~we shouldn't be fighting with each other. She's the real opponent, she's the real problem.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, as president, I will make this a nation that will solve problems. And how? By having the elected officials and the leaders realize they're Americans before they're Republicans or Democrats. I did it in Washington. And I've done it in Ohio by having the elected officials realize that they're Ohioans before anything else. Secondly, I will rebuild the relationships and show the respect to our allies around the world. We have no choice but to do that. We will be stronger when we are unified. And we'll fight for freedom and for human rights. And finally, a little bit of what Carly said. The people that are out there listening, America was never great because we ran America from the top down. America is great because we have run America from the bottom up, where we all live in the neighborhoods. One more time in America, we need to revive the concept of citizenship, where everybody's actions make a huge difference in changing the world. We have a Holocaust memorial on our state house grounds. And there is one line on there that stands out all the time. "If you've saved one life, you've changed the world." We need to adopt that as citizens and rebuild and reinspire our country. Thank you. [applause]
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, I agree that we should defund Planned Parenthood. I don't know many people in America who don't think that we should, and in my state, we're trying to figure out how to get it done, because we are threatened with the federal government taking all of our Medicaid money away. I think there is a way to get this done by giving governors the ability to be able to act to defund Planned Parenthood. But when (ph) it comes to closing down the federal government, you gotta be very careful about that. When we shut the government down &mdash; if we have a chance at success and it's a great principle, yes. The president of the United States is not going to sign this, and all we're gonna do is shut the government down, and then we're gonna open up &mdash; open it up, and the American people are gonna shake their heads and say, "what's the story with these Republicans?" So I think there is a way to get to cutting off the funding for Planned Parenthood. I was in the Congress for 18 years, balanced the budget, cut taxes, got it done. Changed welfare, went around the president to get welfare reform done. There are ways to do it without having to shut the government down, but I'm sympathetic to the fact that we don't want this organization to get funding, and the money ought to be reprogrammed for family planning in other organizations that don't support this tactic. But I would not be for shutting the government down
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, I have one now &mdash; they (ph) call me, "Unit One". My wife says, "You'll never be Unite One, I'm Unite One. You're Unit Two."
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, it's probably not, maybe, legal, but, I would pick Mother Theresa, the lady that I had a chance to meet, a woman who lived a life so much bigger than her own. An inspiration to everyone when we think about our responsibility to love our neighbor as we love ourselves.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, let me just say this. First of all, I think it's a bad agreement, I would never have done it. But, you know, a lot of our problems in the world today is that we don't have the relationship with our allies. If we want to go everywhere alone, we will not have the strength as (ph) if we could rebuild with our allies. Now, this agreement, we don't know what's going to happen in 18 months. I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years. I've seen lots of issues in foreign affairs, and foreign &mdash; in terms of global politics, you have to be steady. Now, here's the &mdash; if they cheat, we slap the sanctions back on. If they help Hamas, and Hezbollah, we slap the sanctions back on. And, if we find out that they may be developing a nuclear weapon, than the military option is on the table. We are stronger when we work with the Western civilization, our friends in Europe, and just doing it on our own I don't think is the right policy.
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, look, people still have to get to know me, so I want to spend my time talking about my experience reforming welfare, balancing budgets, cutting taxes, providing economic growth when I was in Washington, turning Ohio around. Eight billion in the hole, $2 billion surplus, up over 300,000 jobs, big tax cuts, strengthening our credit. All those things matter but, you know, as a young man in my first election in 1978, I defeated an incumbent Democrat. I defeated an incumbent Democrat in 1982; running on the Reagan program, I was the only Republican in America to defeat an incumbent Democrat that year. And then, when I won for election of governor, I was the first Republican to defeat an incumbent in 36 years, and the first person to have never run statewide out of politics for 10 years to beat an incumbent. That hadn't happened for 96 years. So, we'll get to the point where we'll talk about Hillary Clinton, or whoever the nominee is, record. But right now, I want to give people sense of hope, sense of purpose, a sense of unity, sense that we can do it. So
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Yeah, well
John Kasich~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~You know, at the end of the day, I'm going to continue to talk about my record, because there is, did you ever notice when people run for office, they run for president, they make a lot of promises, they don't keep them.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~and when I do, I'm gonna jump in.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~as you asked earlier today. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Because we're not going to destroy our economy the way the left-wing government that we are under now wants to do. We're not going to
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~But radical terrorism cannot be solved by intellect. It cannot &mdash; they require &mdash; what they need, is they need an operating space. That's what Afghanistan was for Al Qaida. It was a vacuum that they filled, and they created an operating space. That's why they had to be drawn out of there. That's why they had to be destroyed. It is the reason why ISIS has grown as well. We allowed them &mdash; we allowed a vacuum to emerge in Syria. They used it as an operating space to grow; and today they're not just in Iraq and Syria anymore, they're now in Libya, conducting operations in the Sinai. They're now in Afghanistan, trying to supplant the Taliban as the most powerful radical jihadist group on the ground there, as well. You cannot allow radical jihadists to have an operating safe haven anywhere in the world.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Hold on, a second, Jake, he asked me, as well. I'd like to actually
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I know we all look alike. [laughter]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I never get to addressed, and
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I want to go even deeper &mdash; and I want to go even deeper in that direction, because I think the belief that somehow by retreating, America makes the world safer has been disproven every single time it's ever been tried. Syria's a perfect example of it. The uprising in Syria was not started by the United States; it was started by the Syrian people. And I warned at the time &mdash; this was three and a half years ago &mdash; I openly and repeatedly warned that if we did not find moderate elements on the ground that we could equip and arm, that void would be filled by radical jihadists. Well, the president didn't listen, the administration didn't follow through, and that's exactly what happened. That is why ISIS grew. That is why ISIS then came over the border from Syria and back into Iraq. What is happening in that region is the direct consequence of the inability to lead and of disengagement. And the more we disengage, the more airplanes from Moscow you're going to see flying out of Damascus and out of Syria
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~In the middle of negotiating this treaty, Khamenei led the assembled masses in chanting, death to America. I'm reminded of a great editorial cartoon. It shows the Ayatollah Khamenei saying, "Death to all Americans," and then it shows John Kerry coming back, saying, "Can we meet ya half way?" [laughter] We need a commander-in-chief who will stand up and protect this country. And I'll tell you, I can't wait to stand on that debate stage with Hillary Clinton and to make abundantly clear if you vote for Hillary, you are voting for the Ayatollah Khomeini to possess a nuclear weapon and if you elect me as president, under no circumstances will a theocratic ayatollah who chants death to America ever be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon. [crosstalk]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake, you mentioned me and called me a denier. Let me say, climate change
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Let me tell you &mdash; I will tell you we have zero responsibility, because let's remember what the president said. He said the attack he would conduct would be a pinprick. Well, the United States military was not build to conduct pinprick attacks. If the United States military is going to be engaged by a commander-in-chief, it should only be engaged in an endeavor to win. And we're not going to authorize use of force if you're not put in a position where they can win. And quite frankly, people don't trust this president as commander-in-chief because of that. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Ms. Dana, I agree that English is the unifying language of our country, and everyone should learn to speak it. It's important. I want to tell you a story about someone that didn't speak English that well. It was my grandfather; he came to this country in the 1960s, as a &mdash; escaping Cuba. And he lived with us, growing up. And my grandfather loved America. He understood what was so special about this country. He loved Ronald Reagan; he would be very proud of the fact that we're here this evening. My grandfather instilled in me the belief that I was blessed to live in the one society in all of human history where even I, the son of a bartender and a maid, could aspire to have anything, and be anything that I was willing to work hard to achieve. But he taught me that in Spanish, because it was the language he was most comfortable in. And he became a conservative, even though he got his news in Spanish. And so, I do give interviews in Spanish, and here's why &mdash; because I believe that free enterprise and limited government is the best way to help people who are trying to achieve upward mobility. And if they get their news in Spanish, I want them to hear that directly from me. Not from a translator at Univision.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~OK. A skeptic. You can measure the climate. You can measure it. That's not the issue we're discussing. Here is what I'm skeptical of. I'm skeptical of the decisions that the left wants us to make, because I know the impact those are going to have and they're all going to be on our economy. They will not do a thing to lower the rise of the sea. They will not do a thing to cure the drought here in California. But what they will do is they will make America a more expensive place to create jobs. And today with millions of people watching this broadcast that are struggling paycheck to paycheck that do not know how they're going to pay their bills at the end of this month, I'm not in favor of anything that is going to make it harder for them to raise their family. [crosstalk]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~One of the things that made Ronald Reagan a great president, is that he understood that America was a unique nation, like any other that had existed throughout human history. He knew it was founded on universal principles that were powerful, the dignity of all people, human rights, the rights of all to live in freedom and liberty, and choose their own path in life. He didn't just believe it, he acted on it. That's why bringing down communism was so important to him. If I'm honored with the opportunity to be president, I hope that our Air Force One will fly, first and foremost, to our allies; in Israel, in South Korea, and Japan. They know we stand with them. That America can be counted on. It would also fly to China, not just to meet with our enemies, not just to meet with those adversaries of ours that are there, but also to meet with those that aspire to freedom and liberty within China. I would even invite them to my inauguration. We would also fly into Moscow and into Russia. And not just meet with the leaders of Russia, but also meet with those who aspire to freedom and liberty in Russia. And ultimately, I hope that my Air Force One, if I become president, will one day land in a free Cuba, where its people can choose its leaders and its own destiny. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~respond. I think I'm the first senator. [laughter] The No. 1 test for use of military force should be the vital national security interest of the United States. The reason why I opposed President Obama bombing Syria, is because he couldn't answer the question what do you do if chemical weapons end up in the hands of radical Islamic terrorists like al-Nusra, like Al Qaida, like ISIS? Now, I also want to respond to several folks up here who said we should trust this Iranian deal, see if the Iranians will comply. Anyone who is paying attention to what Khamenei says knows that they will not comply. There is a reason Khamenei refers to Israel as the little Satan, and America as the great Satan.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Senator Rubio, you mean?
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Thank you. My name is Marco Rubio. I'm from Florida. My wife Jeanette and I are the proud &mdash; we've been married 17 years, and we're the proud parents of four children, two of whom were able to join us here this evening. I'm honored to be here at the Reagan Library, at a place that honors the legacy of a man who inspired not just my interest in public service, but also our love for country. And I'm also aware that California has a drought, and so that's why I made sure I brought my own water. [laughter]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~The &mdash; Rosa Parks, an everyday American that changed the course of history.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~There's a broader issue here, Hugh. And there's a broader issue here as well. First of all, the only people that follow the law are law-abiding people. Criminals by definition ignore the law, so you can pass all the gun laws in the world, like the left wants. The criminals are going to ignore it because they are criminals. Here's the real issue. [applause] The real issue &mdash; the real issue is not what are people using to commit violence, but why are they committing the violence? And here's the truth: Because you cannot separate the social, moral wellbeing of your people from their economic and other wellbeing. You cannot separate it. You can't have a strong country without strong people, you cannot have strong people without strong values, and you cannot have strong values without strong families and the institutions in this country that defend and support those families.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Trust (ph) me, I get that. OK.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, and I don't &mdash; he may have lined up with their positions on this issue. But here is the bottom line. Every proposal they put forward are going to be proposals that will make it harder to do business in America, that will make it harder to create jobs in America. Single parents are already struggling across this country to provide for their families. Maybe a billionaire here in California can afford an increase in their utility rates, but a working family in Tampa, Florida, or anywhere across this country cannot afford it. So we are not going to destroy our economy. We are not going to make America a harder place to create jobs in order to pursue policies that will do absolutely nothing, nothing to change our climate, to change our weather, because America is a lot of things, the greatest country in the world, absolutely. But America is not a planet. And we are not even the largest carbon producer anymore, China is. And they're drilling a hole and digging anywhere in the world that they can get a hold of. So the bottom line is, I am not in favor of any policies that make America a harder place for people to live, or to work, or to raise their families. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, and today, we have a left-wing government under this president that is undermining all of the institutions and society that support the family and teach those values.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, first of all, I have an understanding of exactly what it is Russia and Putin are doing, and it's pretty straightforward. He wants to reposition Russia, once again, as a geopolitical force. He himself said that the destruction of the Soviet Union &mdash; the fall of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century, and now he's trying to reverse that. He's trying to destroy NATO. And this is what this is a part of. He is exploiting a vacuum that this administration has left in the Middle East. Here's what you're gonna see in the next few weeks: the Russians will begin to fly &mdash; fly combat missions in that region, not just targeting ISIS, but in order to prop up Assad. He will also, then, turn to other countries in the region and say, "America is no longer a reliable ally, Egypt. America is no longer a reliable ally, Saudi Arabia. Begin to rely on us." What he is doing is he is trying to replace us as the single most important power broker in the Middle East, and this president is allowing it. That is what is happening in the Middle East. That's what's happening with Russia, and
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, let me say that legal immigration is not an issue I read about in the newspaper. Immigration, illegal immigration, all the good aspects of immigration and all the negative ones as well, I live with. My family's immigrants. My neighbors are all immigrants. My in-laws are all immigrants. So I've seen every aspect of it, and I can tell you America doesn't have one immigration problem, it has three. First, despite the fact that we are the most generous country in the history of the world in allowing people to come here legally, we have people still coming illegally. Second, we have a legal immigration system that no longer works. It primary is built on the basis of whether you have a relative living here instead of merit. And third, we have 11 million or 12 million people, many of whom have been here for longer than a decade who are already here illegally. And we must deal with all three of these problems. We cannot deal with all three of these problems in one massive piece of legislation. I learned that. We tried it that way. Here's the way forward: First, we must &mdash; we must secure our border, the physical border, with &mdash; with a wall, absolutely. But we also need to have an entry/exit tracking system. 40 percent of the people who come here illegally come legally, and then they overstay the visa. We also need a mandatory e-verify system. After we've done that, step two would be to modernize our legal immigration system so you come to America on the basis of what you can contribute economically, not whether or not simply you have a relative living here. And after we've done those two things, I believe the American people
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, that's why we have a debate. I think that we should have a deeper debate about these issues, because there is no more important decision that a president will make.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, there are some people in Florida upset at me over a joke I made about Florida State, but, what the heck, I want my codename to be Gator. [laughter] [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, you should ask him questions in detail about the foreign policy issues our president will confront, because you had better be able to lead our country on the first day. Not six months from now, not a year from now, on the first day in office, our president could very well confront a national security crisis. You can't predict it. Sometimes you cannot control it. And it is the most &mdash; the federal government does all kinds of things it's not supposed to be doing. It regulates bathrooms. It regulates schools that belong to local communities. But the one thing that the federal government must do, the one thing that only the federal government can do is keep us safe. And a president better be up-to-date on those issues on his first day in office, on her first day in office. [applause]
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~will be very reasonable and responsible about what you do with someone who's been here and isn't a criminal. If you're a criminal, obviously, you will not be able to stay.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Yeah. He did. Let me &mdash; I'm proud to serve in the United States Senate. You know, when I ran five years ago, the entire leadership of my party in Washington lined up against me. But I'm glad I won. And I'm glad that I ran, because this country's headed in the wrong direction. And if we keep electing the same people, nothing is going to change. And you're right, I have missed some votes, and I'll tell you why, Mr. Trump. Because in my years in the Senate, I've figured out very quickly that the political establishment in Washington, D.C. in both political parties is completely out of touch with the lives of our people. You have millions of people in this country living paycheck to paycheck, and nothing is being done about it. We are about to leave our children with $18 trillion in &mdash; in &mdash; in debt, and they're about to raise the debt limit again. We have a world that grows increasingly dangerous, and we are eviscerating our military spending and signing deals with Iran. And these &mdash; if this thing continues, we are going to be the first Americans to leave our children worse off than ourselves. That's why I'm missing votes. Because I am leaving the Senate, I'm not running for re-election, and I'm running for president because I know this: unless we have the right president, we cannot make America fulfill its potential, but with the right person in office, the 21st century can be the greatest era that our nation has ever known.
Marco Rubio~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Yes, well, it does. But it's in the following way, this is an important question. I think if you're running for president, these are important issues, because look at around the world today. There is a lunatic in North Korea with dozens of nuclear weapons and long-range rocket that can already hit the very place in which we stand tonight. The Chinese are rapidly expanding their military. They hack into our computers. They're building artificial islands in the South China Sea, the most important shipping lane in the world. A gangster in Moscow is not just threatening Europe, he's threatening to destroy and divide NATO. You have radical jihadists in dozens of countries across multiple continents. And they even recruit Americans using social media to try to attack us here at home. And now we have got this horrible deal with Iran where a radical Shia cleric with an apocalyptic vision of the future is also guaranteed to one day possess nuclear weapons and also a long-range rocket that can hit the United States. These are extraordinarily dangerous times that we live in. And the next president of the United States better be someone that understands these issues and has good judgment about them because the number one issue that a president will ever confront, and the most important obligation that the federal government has, is to keep this nation safe. And today we are not doing that. We are eviscerating our military. And we have a president that is more respectful to the ayatollah in Iran than he is to the prime minister of Israel. [applause]

Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~&mdash; that if it's not reserved in the Constitution, then the 10th Amendment says it's left to the states. But somebody forgot to send a memo to Washington.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~And the reason Barack Obama has been dangerous to this country and we better elect someone who had some executive experience, is because we cannot afford another eight years having a person in the office who doesn't know what he does not know.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~At the end of my presidency I would like to believe that the world would be a safe place, and there wouldn't be the threats. not only to the U.S., but to Israel and our allies, because we would have the most incredible well-trained, well-equipped, well- prepared military in the history of mankind. And they would know that the commander-in-chief would never send them to a mission without all the resources necessary, but people wouldn't bully us anymore. Because they would know that that would be an invitation to their destruction. Domestically, we would be operating under a tax system that eliminated the IRS. People wouldn't be punished for their work, and for what they produced. And life would be really deemed precious. Abortion would be no more. It would be as much of a scourge in our past as slavery is. And we would have a peaceful country, where people respected each other and people respected law enforcement. And we would focus on cures. And we would make this country not only safe from our enemies without, but safe from the enemies within. And it would be a good place to raise our kids and our grandkids. [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Because I think it is incredibly important. This is really about the survival of Western civilization. This is not just a little conflict with a Middle Eastern country that we've just now given over $100 billion to, the equivalent in U.S. terms is $5 trillion. This threatens Israel immediately, this threatens the entire Middle East, but it threatens the United States of America. And we can't treat a nuclear Iranian government as if it is just some government that would like to have power. This is a government for 36 years has killed Americans, they kidnapped Americans, they have maimed Americans. They have sponsored terrorist groups, Hamas and Hezbollah, and they threaten the very essence of Western civilization. To give them this agreement, that the president treats like the Magna Carta, but Iranians treat it like it's toilet paper, and we must, simply, make it very clear that the next president, one of us on this stage, will absolutely not honor that agreement, and will destroy it and will be tough with Iran, because otherwise, we put every person in this world in a very dangerous place.

Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I'd go with Duck Hunter.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I'm Mike Huckabee. I'm delighted to be on this stage with some remarkable fellow Republicans. None of us are a self-professed socialist. None of us on this state are under investigation by the FBI because we destroyed government records, or because we leaked secrets. I know that there are some in the Wall-Street-to-Washington axis of power who speak of all of us contemptuously. But I'm here to say that I think we are, in fact, the A team. We have some remarkable people, and, in fact, not only are we the A team; we even have our own Mr. T, who doesn't mind saying about others, "you're a fool." And I'm delighted to be here with all of these guys, and would put any of them in an administration that I led. Thank you very much. [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I've been patiently waiting, and I'm going to just say this about Iran.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I have a different idea. I think we ought to get rid of all the taxes on people who produce. Why should we penalize productivity? And it's why I'm an unabashed supporter of the "fair tax," which would be a tax on our consumption, rather than a tax on our productivity. In other words, you're not going to tax anybody for what they earn, whether it's worker whose working by the hour or whether it's a hedge fund manager. If they can produce something and bring capital and labor to create jobs, we need some jobs. And I think the "fair tax" makes more sense. Now, Jake, I've been listening to everybody on the stage and there is a lot of back and forth about I'm the only one who has done this, the only one who has done that, I've done great things. We've all done great things or we wouldn't be on this stage. But it occurs to me as we're sitting here in the Reagan Library that most of us would like to pay tribute to a guy who, when he got elected, didn't get elected telling everybody how great he was. He got elected telling everybody how great the American people were. And he empowered them to live their dreams, which is what I'd love to see us do by no longer penalizing the people who are out there working because they are taking a gut punch right now. [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I think we need to remember that there are maybe some controversies about autism, but there is no controversy about the things that are really driving the medical costs in this country. And I would really believe that the next president ought to declare a war on cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's, because those are the four things that are causing the greatest level of cost. John Kennedy said, "we'll go to the moon in a decade and bring a man back," and we did it. I grew up in the '50s. I remember the polio vaccine. We saved billions of dollars since that time, because we haven't had to treat for polio. Why doesn't this country focus on cures rather than treatment? Why don't we put a definitive focus scientifically on finding the cure for cancer, for heart disease, for diabetes and for Alzheimer's, a disease alone that will cost us &mdash;
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I would certainly love to get in on this, because I think the single  [crosstalk]

Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Just today &mdash; just today, there was a new report that 50 different intelligence analysts have said that what they sent up the ladder was doctored by senior officials, so that they could give some happy talk to the situation that we face. I love the idea of a good intellectual capacity to deal with our enemies, but the fact is, if you don't have good intelligence that is reliable and honest, you won't have good intelligence and you cannot make good decisions. The next president is primarily elected not just to know things, but to know what to do with the things that he knows. And the most dangerous person in any room is the person who doesn't know what he doesn't know.
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~No, I don't think he's on the wrong side of such an issue. Jeb is a friend. I'm not up here to fight with Jeb or to fight with anybody else. But I am here to fight for somebody who is a county clerk elected under the Kentucky constitution that 75 percent of the people of that state had voted for that said that marriage was between a man and a woman. The Supreme Court in a very, very divided decision decided out of thin air that they were just going to redefine marriage. It's a decision that the other justices in dissent said they didn't have and there wasn't a constitutional shred of capacity for them to do it. I thought that everybody here passed ninth-grade civics. The courts cannot legislate. That's what Roberts said. But heck, it's what we learned in civics. The courts can't make a law. They can interpret one. They can review one. They can't implement it. They can't force it. But here's what happened: Because the courts just decided that something was going to be and people relinquished it and the other two branches of government sat by silently &mdash; I thought we had three branches of government, they were all equal to each other, we have separation of powers, and we have checks and balances. If the court can just make a decision and we just all surrender to it, we have what Jefferson said was judicial tyranny. The reason that this is a real issue that we need to think about
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~No, no. Let me finish this one thought, Jake. I haven't gotten that much time, so I'm going to take just what little I can here. We made accommodation to the Fort Hood shooter to let him grow a beard. We made accommodations to the detainees at Gitmo &mdash; I've been to Gitmo, and I've seen the accommodations that we made to the Muslim detainees who killed Americans. You're telling me that you cannot make an accommodation for an elected Democrat county clerk from Rowan County, Kentucky? What else is it other than the criminalization of her faith and the exaltation of the faith of everyone else who might be a Fort Hood shooter or a detainee at Gitmo? [applause]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~One final thing. I'd make darn sure that we absolutely believe the 10th Amendment. Every governor on this stage would share this much with you. Every one of us &mdash; our biggest fight wasn't always with the legislature or even with the Democrats. My gosh, half the time, it was with the federal government who apparently never understood &mdash;
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~That's an easy one. I'd put my wife on there. [laughter] I've been married to her 41 years. She's fought cancer and lived through it. She's raised three kids, five great grandkids, and she's put up with me. I mean, who else could possibly be on that money other than my wife. And that way, she could spend her own money with her face. [laughter]
Mike Huckabee~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~You better believe I will, because I'm tired of liberals always having a litmus test and conservatives are supposed to pretend we don't. Well let me tell you what mine would be. Number one, I'd ask do you think that the unborn child is a human being or is it just a blob of tissue? I'd want to know the answer to that. I'd want to know do you believe in the First Amendment, do you believe that religious liberty is the fundamental liberty around which all the other freedoms of this country are based? And I'd want to know do you really believe in the Second Amendment, do you believe that we have an individual right to bear arms to protect ourselves and our family and to protect our country? And do you believe in the Fifth and the 14th Amendment? Do you believe that a person, before they're deprived of life and liberty, should in fact have due process and equal protection under the law? Because if you do, you're going to do more than defund Planned Parenthood.

Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~A second opinion? [laughter] One of the greatest &mdash; one of the greatest medical discoveries of all times was &mdash; were the vaccines, particularly for smallpox. And if you want to read a story, it's called The Speckled Monster, it's an amazing story, it was all done voluntary. But people came in by the droves. George Washington wouldn't let his wife visit until she got vaccinated. So I'm all for vaccines. But I'm also for freedom. I'm also a little concerned about how they're bunched up. My kids had all of their vaccines, and even if the science doesn't say bunching them up is a problem, I ought to have the right to spread out my vaccines out a little bit at the very least.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Absolutely. Go ahead.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~And actually, under the current circumstances, kids who had privilege like you do, don't go to jail, but the poor kids in our inner cities go to jail. I don't think that's fair. And I think we need to acknowledge it, and it is hypocritical to still want to put poor people in jail
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~But let me respond. The thing is, is that in Florida, Governor Bush campaigned against medical marijuana. That means that a small child like Morgan Hintz (ph) that has seizures is day, is failing on non-traditional medications, is not allowed to use cannabis oil. And if they do that in Florida, they will take the child away, they will put the parents in jail. And that's what that means if you're against allowing people use medical marijuana, you'll actually put them in jail.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~But that means you'll put people in jail. [crosstalk]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Can I make a response to that?
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Good evening, everyone. I'm an eye surgeon from Bowling Green, Kentucky. My wife, Kelly, and I have been married for nearly 25 years, and I spend my days defending the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Here is the thing, he doesn't want to make it about medical marijuana, but what if New Jersey's medical marijuana contradicts the federal law? He's saying he'll send the federal government in, and he will enforce the federal law. That's not consistent with the Tenth Amendment. It is not consistent with states' rights. And it is not consistent with the conservative vision for the country. I don't think we should be sending the federal police in to arrest a mother and separate them from their child for giving a medicine to their child for seizures. [crosstalk]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Hugh, can I &mdash; can I make a response to that?
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I kind of have to laugh when I think of, "Mmm, sounds like a non sequitur." He was asked whether or not he would be capable and it would be in good hands to be in charge of the nuclear weapons, and all of a sudden, there's a sideways attack at me. I think that really goes to really the judgment. Do we want someone with that kind of character, that kind of careless language to be negotiating with Putin? Do we want someone like that to be negotiating with Iran? I think really there's a sophomoric quality that is entertaining about Mr. Trump, but I am worried. I'm very concerned about him &mdash; having him in charge of the nuclear weapons, because I think his response, his &mdash; his visceral response to attack people on their appearance &mdash; short, tall, fat, ugly &mdash; my goodness, that happened in junior high. Are we not way above that? Would we not all be worried to have someone like that in charge of the nuclear arsenal?
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I met Ronald Reagan as a teenager, and my family, we're big supporters of him when he ran against Gerald Ford. It was a big deal because he was the grassroots, running against the establishment, and I'll never forget that. And, how he stood up and said, you know what, this is something new that our country needs, and our party needs. If I were president, I would try to be one who says, you know what, I'm a Reagan Conservative. I'm someone who believes in peace through strength, and I would try to lead the country in that way knowing that our goal is peace, and that war is the last resort, not the first resort. And, that when we go to war, we go to war in a constitutional way, which means that we have to vote on it, that war is initiated by congress, not by the president, that we go to war electively (ph). That when we go to war, we don't fight with one arm tied behind our back, we fight all out to win, but then we come home. [applause]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I think one of the great problems, and what American people don't like about politics, is hypocrisy. People have one standard for others and not for them &mdash; for themselves. There is at least one prominent example on the stage of someone who says they smoked pot in high school, and yet the people going to &mdash; to jail for this are poor people, often African-Americans and often Hispanics, and yet the rich kids who use drugs aren't. I personally think that this is a crime for which the only victim is the individual, and I think that America has to take a different attitude. I would like to see more rehabilitation and less incarceration. I'm a fan of the drug courts which try to direct you back towards work and less time in jail. But the bottom line is the states. We say we like the 10th Amendment, until we start talking about this. And I think the federal government has gone too far, I think that the war on drugs has had a racial outcome, and really has been something that has really damaged our inner cities. Not only do the drugs damage them, we damage them again by incarcerating them and then preventing them from getting employment over time. So I don't think that the federal government should override the states. I believe in the 10th Amendment and I really will say that the states are left to themselves. [applause]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I think this gets to the point of wisdom on when to intervene and when we shouldn't. Had we bombed Assad at the time, like President Obama wanted, and like Hillary Clinton wanted and many Republicans wanted, I think ISIS would be in Damascus today. I think ISIS would be in charge of Syria had we bombed Assad. Sometimes both sides of the civil war are evil, and sometimes intervention sometimes makes us less safe. This is real the debate we have to have in the Middle East. Every time we have toppled a secular dictator, we have gotten chaos, the rise of radical Islam, and we're more at risk. So, I think we need to think before we act, and know most interventions, if not a lot of them in the Middle East, have actually backfired on us.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I think this goes back to essentially what we've been saying for the last two or three questions. Carly Fiorina also said we're not going to talk with Putin. Well, think if Reagan had said that during the Cold War? We continued to talk with the Russians throughout the Cold War which is much more significant that where we are now. Should we continue to talk with Iran? Yes. Should we cut up the agreement immediately? That's absurd. Wouldn't you want to know if they complied? Now, I'm going to vote against the agreement because I don't think there's significant leverage, but it doesn't mean that I would immediately not look at the agreement, and cut it up without looking to see if whether or not Iran has complied. The same goes with China. I don't think we need to be rash, I don't think we need to be reckless, and I think need to leave lines of communication open. Often we talk about whether we should be engaged in the world, or disengaged in the world, and I think this is an example of some who want to isolate us, actually, and not be engaged. We do need to be engaged with Russia. It doesn't mean we give them a free pass, or China a free pass, but, to be engaged, to continue to talk. We did throughout the Cold War, and it would be a big mistake not to do it here.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~If you want a skeptic &mdash; if you want a skeptic, Jake, I will happily jump into that briar patch. If you want a real
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~If you want boots on the ground, and you want them to be our sons and daughters, you got 14 other choices. There will always be a Bush or Clinton for you, if you want to go back to war in Iraq. But the thing is, the first war was a mistake. And I'm not sending our sons and our daughters back to Iraq. The war didn't work. We can amplify those who live there. The Kurds deserve to be armed and I'll arm them. We can use our Air Force to amplify the forces there. But the boots on the ground need to be the people who live there. My goodness, I'm still upset with the Saudi Arabians for everything they do over there. They've funded the arms that went to the jihadists. They're not accepting any of the people, any of the migrants that have been &mdash; the refugees that are being pushed out of Syria. Saudi Arabia is not accepting one. Why are we always the world's patsies that we have to go over there and fight their wars for them? They need to fight their wars, we need to defend American interests, but it is not in America's national security interests to have another war in Iraq.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~in his remarks. May I make a response?
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~ISIS will now be in charge of Syria

Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Ooh, that's a tough one. You know, I'm big on &mdash; that we were &mdash; and I love what Carly said about women's suffrage. I think Susan B. Anthony might be a good choice.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~The remark was made that there hadn't been anyone else on the podium opposed to the Iraq War. I've made my career as being an opponent of the Iraq War. I was opposed to the Syria war. I was opposed to arming people who are our enemies. Iran is now stronger because Hussein is gone. Hussein was the great bulwark and counterbalance to the Iranians. So when we complain about the Iranians, you need to remember that the Iraq War made it worse. Originally, Governor Bush was asked, was the Iraq War a mistake, and he said, "No. We'd do it again." We have to learn sometimes the interventions backfire. The Iraq War backfired and did not help us. We're still paying the repercussions of a bad decision.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Understand what they're saying. if they're going to say we are going to enforce the federal law against what the state law is, they aren't really believing in the Tenth Amendment. Governor Christie would go into Colorado, and if you're breaking any federal law on marijuana, even though the state law allows it, he would put you in jail. If a young mother is trying to give her child cannabis oil for medical marijuana for seizure treatment, he would put her in jail, if it violates federal law. I would let Colorado do what the Tenth Amendment says. This power &mdash; we were never intended to have crime dealing at the federal level. Crime was supposed to be left to the states. Colorado has made their decision. And I don't want the federal government interfering and putting moms in jail, who are trying to get medicine for their kid
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~We have make the decision now in Syria, should we topple Assad? Many up here wanted to topple Assad, and it's like &mdash; I said no, because if you do
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, I'm glad we're having a discussion about taxes because everybody laments that we lose jobs overseas, we have. Our companies, and our jobs are being chased overseas by a 70,000 page tax code, so, that's why I've chosen to get rid of the whole thing, and have one single rate, 14 and a-half percent for everybody, business, and for corporate income, and personal income. But, we also get rid of the payroll tax, so the working class would get a tax break as well. So, I think a flat tax, eliminating the tax code, getting rid of all the loopholes, is the way to go, and it's the way we get America going again.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, I hate to say it, but Donald Trump has a bit of a point here. The case that was decided around 1900 was, people had a green card, were here legally, and they said that their children were citizens. There's never been a direct Supreme Court case on people who were here illegally, whether or not their kids are citizens. So it hasn't really been completely adjudicated. The 14th Amendment says that "those who are here and under the jurisdiction." The original author of the &mdash; of the 14th Amendment said on the Senate floor that this was applying to slaves, and did not specifically apply to others.
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, I think if we left it open, we could see how many people smoked pot in high school. [laughter]
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, you know, the thing is that
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, you vote &mdash; you oppose medical marijuana
Rand Paul~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Yeah, I was talking about [inaudible] &mdash; well, let me
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~&mdash; and go forward and actually make a point. This is why &mdash;
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~&mdash; people are upset with Washington.
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~: That's because of Barack &mdash; that's because of Barack Obama.
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~: That's because of Barack Obama. We've had a president who called ISIS the J.V. squad, Yemen a success story, Iran a place we can do business with. It's not because of George W. Bush; it's because of Barack Obama  [applause] [inaudible] on that point, though, whether it's &mdash; whether we're talking about national security, foreign policy or we're talking about domestic policy, the key
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~a lot of those people, though, and I'm going to echo what Senator Rubio just said. This is an issue where, we're talking about my state, it's thousands of manufacturing jobs. Thousands of manufacturing jobs for a rule the Obama administration, own EPA has said will have a marginal impact on climate change. So we're going to put thousands and thousands of jobs in my state, I think it's something like 30,000 in Ohio, other states across this country, we're going to put people &mdash; manufacturing jobs, the kind of jobs that are far greater than minimum wage, this administration is willing to put at risk for something its own EPA says is marginal (ph)
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~and as we all know
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~But Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~But Jake, this &mdash; this is &mdash; this
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~First of all, I got to say to Carson, Huckabee, thanks a lot for making the rest of us look like chumps up here, but, I'd pick Clara Barton. I once worked for the American Red Cross, she was a great founder of the Red Cross.
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Good evening, I'm Scott Walker, and tonight, I want to thank and Mrs. Reagan, and the Reagan Library for hosting us. You see, in my lifetime, the greatest president was a governor from California. Ronald Reagan knew how to go big, and go bold. He understood the essence of moving this country forward, and that's what I did when I took on the status quo in my state, and the Washington based special interest. Now, more than ever, America needs a leader who will go big and bold again. Someone who's been tested. I'm ready to be that leader. Thank you. [applause]
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Harley. I love riding Harley's.
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I'm going to sign an order that makes the Congress live by the same rules as everybody else.
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I won't back down
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake, Jake, Jake, I just want to address that issue because you said I didn't answer, and I did. I said, to me, I think the real focus shouldn't be &mdash; you know, Hillary Clinton talks about the minimum wage. That's her answer to grow the economy. The answer is to give people the skills and the education so they make far more than minimum wage. I don't want to argue about how low things are going to be, I want to talk about how do we lift everyone up in America. That's what Reagan talked about. It wasn't how bad things were, it was how to make it better for everyone. That's what we've done in Wisconsin, that's exactly what we'd do as
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake, just one more moment. This is &mdash; there's something bigger to this. Now, I &mdash; like so many other governors here, I defunded Planned Parenthood four-and-a-half years ago, in a Blue State. But it's bigger than that. We did that in a Blue State, we took the money and put it into women's health, so we did exactly what we're talking about here. But I think the bigger issue here is we should be able to do this nationally, and this is precisely why so many Republicans are upset with Washington. They see the House and they see the Senate and they say why can't we pass this. Why can't we defund Planned &mdash; put it in a spending bill. Forget about the 60-vote rule, there's no reason &mdash; and the Constitution doesn't call for 60 votes. Pass it with 51 votes, put it on the desk of the president &mdash;
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake, this is &mdash; this is &mdash; this is
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake, yeah, absolutely, I'll take this on, because this is an issue that's important in this race. Just because he says it doesn't make it true. The facts are the facts. [applause] We balanced a $3.6 billion budget deficit, we did it by cutting taxes &mdash; $4.7 billion to help working families, family farmers, small business owners and senior citizens. And it's about time people in America stand up and take note of this. If you want someone that can actually take on the special interest of Washington, which you yourself said you were part of, using the system, we need somebody that will stand up and fight for average Americans to put them back in charge of their government. I'm the one who is taking that on. I'll do that as your next president.
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Mr. Trump, you're using the talking points of the Democrats
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~No, no
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~on any of these issues.
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~So, the best way to help people see their wages go up is to get them the education, the skill they need, to take on careers that pay more than minimum wage. And, it's why we talk about it, it's all about jobs. You want to help actually get jobs, it's why on that last question we were trying to jump in on taxes. To me, it's not just about taxes, cutting taxes. I've done it as much as anyone has. I've cut income taxes, I've cut property taxes. In fact, property taxes are lower today in my state than they were before we took office. The real issues about jobs. Ronald Reagan, our plan is based on the Ronald Reagan tax cuts of 1986. That brought about one of the longest sustained periods of economic growth in American history. All the things we should be talking about tonight are about how do we create jobs, helping people get the skills and the education qualifications they need to succeed. That's the way you help people create jobs. It's part of our large plan to reform the tax code, to cut taxes, to put in place an education system that gives people the skills and education that they need. To put in place all the above energy policy, but you start on day one with repealing Obamacare. I'm the only one on this stage that's actually got a plan, introduced an actual plan to repeal Obamacare on day one. I'll send a bill up to Congress, and to make sure enact it
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~that failed three times in four and a half years when I got elected, because it is working. We balanced a budget. You want to talk about balanced budgets? You took four major projects into bankruptcy over and over and over again. You can't take America into bankruptcy. That's what's wrong with the politicians in Washington right now. They think we can take a country into bankruptcy. [crosstalk]
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~That will ensure they repeal Obamacare
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~the key issue here is talking about leadership. Now, there's a lot of greater people up here, and you've heard a lot of great ideas out there. But I would ask the American people, look at who's been tested. When there were 100,000 protesters in my capital, I didn't back down, when they issued death threats against me and threats against my family, I didn't back down, when they tried to recall me, I didn't back down, and when they made me the &mdash; one of their number-one targets last year, I didn't back down. Give me the chance to be your president.
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~This is actually what's wrong &mdash; this is what's wrong with this debate. We're not talking about real issues. And Mr. Trump, we don't need an apprentice in the White House. [applause] We don't need an apprentice in the White House. We have one right now. He told us all the things we wanted to hear back in 2008. We don't know who you are or where you're going. We need someone who can actually get the job done. And you talked about business.
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~To be clear, what I said the other day was that we need to lift the political restrictions that are already in play. Barack Obama's administration has put political restrictions on the military personnel already in Iraq. We need to lift those and then we need to listen to our military experts, not the political forces in the White House, but our military experts about how many more we sent in. And we certainly shouldn't have a commander-in-chief who sends a message to our adversaries as to how far we're going to go, and how far we're willing to fight, so I'm not putting a troop number. What I'm saying is lift the political restrictions. When you do that, you empower our military personnel already there to work with the Kurd and the Sunni allies, to reclaim the territory taken by ISIS. And to do so in a way that allows that ISIS doesn't go back in Syria, as we were just talking about here. That is the fundamental problem going forward. We have a president &mdash; and Hillary Clinton was a part of this, by the way, who has made political decisions for our men and women in uniform. I want the men and women at home to know, if I'm commander-in-chief, I will only send you into harm's way when our national security is at risk. And if we do, you know you'll have our full support, the support of the American people, and you'll have a clear path for victory. [applause]
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Two parts to that, one on China, one back for a second on Iran. When it comes to China, why would we be giving an official state visit to a country that's been involved in a massive cyber attack against the United States? That's not just a visit, that's a 21 gun salute on the South Lawn of the White House. It just doesn't make any sense. If we're ever going to send a message to them, wouldn't this be the time, when they've issued this, sort of, massive attack against us? And, Jake, for the question, I was one of the first ones to call for terminating the bad deal with Iran on day one. The President came after me and said I need to bone up. You know, the President who called ISIS the JV squad said I needed to bone up. The reality is it's a bad deal on day one, and it's a bad deal because this president has allowed Iran to go closer, and closer. I'd love to play cards with this guy because Barack Obama folds on everything with Iran. We need a leader who's going to stand up, and actually [inaudible]
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, I turned 13 years old two days before Ronald Reagan was first elected. A lot of people forget this, but just a few days before that election 1980, he was behind in the polls. And I think what changed things was people in America realized they didn't want to hear what was bad about America, they wanted to know how it was going to be better. Ronald Reagan wasn't just a conservative Republican, he was an eternal optimist in the American people. And I am too. So here's what I think will make America better. We need to live in a world where our children are free, are free from the threats of radical Islamic terrorism. We need to live in an America where we have an economy, where everyone can live their piece of the American dream, no matter what that dream is. And we need to live in an America where we have a federal government that is not too big to fail, but ultimately small enough to succeed, where we send powers back to the states and back to the people. That's what I did in Wisconsin. We took on the big government union bosses, the big government special interests, many of whom came in from Washington, to spend millions of dollars to try and take me out because we stood up to them, we didn't back down in any of those instances. If you give me the chance as your next president, I won't back down any day, anyway, anyhow. I'll fight and win for you and your families every single day I'm in office. [applause]
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~You're using the talking
Scott Walker~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~You &mdash; you &mdash; let me finish
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~&mdash; imposing their liberal policies on millions of Americans &mdash;
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~&mdash; who need to be trusted to govern ourselves.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~and I will as president as well.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~as the strongest supporter of the Second Amendment on this stage today, and I will
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~by not handing over the side deals, and we ought to see the United States Congress
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~fight every day to defend the Bill of Rights.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~for our principles. [applause] [crosstalk]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~George W. Bush appointed John Roberts, and let me give you the consequences of that. If, instead, the President Bush had appointed Edith Jones, and Mike Luttig, which is who I would have appointed, Obamacare would have been struck down three years ago, and the marriage laws of all 50 states would be on the books. These matter, and I fought to defend the constitution my whole life
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I'm Ted Cruz. I am the son of an Irish-Italian mom and a Cuban immigrant dad who fled oppression and came to America seeking freedom. I'm a husband to my best friend, Heidi, who's here tonight. I'm a dad to two little girls who are the loves of my life, Caroline and Catherine. If you're fed up with Washington, if you're looking for someone to stand up to career politicians in both parties, I'm the only one on this stage who has done that over and over again, and if we stand together, we can bring America back.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I &mdash; I am not, and &mdash; and you mentioned that the U.S. Supreme Court had rightly upheld the individual right to keep and bear arms. I was proud to lead 31 states before the U.S. Supreme Court defending the Second Amendment, and we won that landmark victory. And indeed, just a couple of years ago, when Harry Reid and Barack Obama came after the right to keep and bear arms of millions of Americans, I was proud to lead the fight in the United States Senate to protect our right to keep and bear arms, and for that reason
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I was honored to be endorsed by Gun Owners of America
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~I will veto any budget that doesn't fund Planned Parenthood, and Republicans surrender. We need to stop surrendering and start standing
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~It is true that after George W. Bush nominated John Roberts, I supported his confirmation. That was a mistake and I regret that. I wouldn't have nominated John Roberts, and indeed, Governor Bush pointed out why. It wasn't that the President Bushes wanted to appoint a liberal to the court, it's that it was the easier choice. Both David Souter and John Roberts, they didn't have a long paper trail. If you had nominated Edith Jones or Mike Ludig (ph) you would have had a bloody fight and they weren't willing to spend political capital to put a strong judicial conservative on the court. I have spent my entire life, starting from clerking for Chief Justice William Rehnquist on the United States Supreme Court, one of the most principled jurists. We have an out-of-control Court, and I give you my word, if I'm elected president, every single Supreme Court justice will faithfully follow the law and will not act like philosopher kings &mdash;
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake, Jake
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Jake, there is no more important topic in 2016 than this topic right here, and I've listened to several folks saying, "Well, gosh, if they cheat, we'll act." We won't know under this agreement &mdash; there are several facilities in Iran they designate as military facilities that are off limit all together. Beyond that, the other facilities, we give them 24 days notice before inspecting them. That is designed to allow them to hide the evidence. And most astonishingly, this agreement trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves. That makes no sense whatsoever. And let me know &mdash; President Obama is violating federal law
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Ronald Reagan believed in America. If I'm elected president our friends and allies across the globe will know that we stand with them. the bust of Winston Churchill will be back in the Oval Office, and the American embassy in Israel will be in Jerusalem. Enemies across this world will know the United States is not to be trifled with. ISIS will be defeated. We will have a president willing to utter the words, "radical Islamic terrorism," and the Ayatollah Khamenei will understand that he will never, ever, ever acquire nuclear weapons. Here at home, we'll reignite the promise of America. Young people coming out of school, with student loans up to their eyeballs, will find instead of no jobs, two, three, four, five job opportunities. How will that happen? Through tax reform. We'll pass a simple flat tax and abolish the IRS. And through regulatory reform, we will repeal every word of Obamacare. You want to know what I'll do as president? It is real simple. We'll kill the terrorists, we'll repeal Obamacare, and we will defend the Constitution, every single word of it. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~stand up together and say, "Hand over this treaty, and protect this country."
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~This deal abandons four American hostages in Iran, and this deal will only accelerate Iran's acquiring nuclear weapons. You'd better believe it. If I am elected president, on the very first day in office, I will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. [applause]
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, Dana, I've known John Roberts for 20 years, he's amazingly talented lawyer, but, yes, it was a mistake when he was appointed to the Supreme Court. He's a good enough lawyer that he knows in these Obamacare cases he changed the statute, he changed the law in order to force that failed law on millions of Americans for a political outcome. And, you know, we're frustrated as conservatives. We keep winning elections, and then we don't get the outcome we want. And, let me focus on two moments in time. Number one, in 1990, in one room was David Souter, and in another room was Edith Jones, the rock ribbed (ph) conservative on the fifth circuit court of appeals. George Herbert Walker Bush appointed David Souter. And then in 2005, in one room was John Roberts, in another room was my former boss, Mike Luttig, the rock ribbed (ph) conservative on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, I wouldn't change the $10 bill, I'd change the $20. I'd take Jackson off and I'd leave Alexander Hamilton right where he is as one of our Founding Fathers. [applause] And I very much agree with Marco that it should be Rosa Parks. She was a principled pioneer that helped change this country, helped remedy racial injustice, and that would be an honor that would be entirely appropriate.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, Jake, you know, I'm &mdash; I'm very glad that Donald Trump's being in this race has forced the mainstream media finally to talk about illegal immigration. I think that's very important. I like and respect Ben Carson. I'll let him talk about his own plans. But I will say this: The natural next question that primary voters are asking, after we focus on illegal immigration is, okay, what are the records of the various candidates? And this is an issue on which there are stark differences. A majority of the men and women on this stage have previously and publicly embraced amnesty. I am the only candidate on this stage who has never supported amnesty and, in fact, who helped lead the fight to stop a massive amnesty plan. In 2013, when Barack Obama and Harry Reid joined the Washington Republicans in a massive, I stood shoulder to shoulder with Jeff Sessions helping lead the fight. You know, folks here have talked about, how do you secure the borders? Well, I've been leading the fight in the Senate to triple the Border Patrol, to put in place fencings and walls, to put in place a strong biometric exit/entry system
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, let's be clear when it comes to experience. What President Obama wants to do is he's run to the United Nations, and he wants to use the United Nations to bind the United States, and take away our sovereignty. Well, I spent five and a half years as a Solicitor General of Texas, the lead lawyer for the state, in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, and I went in front of the Supreme Court, and took on the world court of the United Nations in a case called Medellin v. Texas, and we won a historic victory saying the World Court, and the U.N., has no power to bind the United States, and no President of the United States, Republican or Democrat, has the authority to give away our sovereignty. And, so, if there's anyone up here who would be bound by this catastrophic deal with Iran, they're giving up the core responsibility of commander in chief, and as president, I would never do that.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, let me tell you, Dana, number one, I'm proud to stand for life. These Planned Parenthood videos are horrifying. I would encourage every American to watch the videos. See &mdash; seeing your Planned Parenthood officials callously, heartlessly bartering and selling the body parts of human beings, and then ask yourself, "are these my values?" These are horrifying. On these videos, Planned Parenthood also essentially confesses to multiple felonies. It is a felony with ten years' jail term to sell the body parts of unborn children for profit. That's what these videos show Planned Parenthood doing. Absolutely we shouldn't be sending $500 million of taxpayer money to funding an ongoing criminal enterprise, and I'll tell you, the fact that Republican leadership in both houses has begun this discussion by preemptively surrendering to Barack Obama and saying, "we'll give in because Obama threatens a veto." You know, Obama's committed to his principles. His liberal principles, he will fight for them. He says
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~Well, let me tell you, Jake, the single biggest national security threat facing America right now is the threat of a nuclear Iran. We've seen six and a half years of President Obama leading from behind. Weakness is provocative, and this Iranian nuclear deal is nothing short of catastrophic. This deal, on its face, will send over $100 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, making the Obama administration the world's leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism.
Ted Cruz~Republican Candidates Debate in Simi Valley, California~September 16, 2015~You know, as a Cuban, I might go with Cohiba (ph), and I'll tell you, I'd go with, for Heidi, Angel, because she is my angel.
